  "Title": "Lightfoot should listen to Griffin",
  "Text": "Whatever you think of Ken Griffin's politics\u0097too conservative for my taste\u0097you have to acknowledge his sense of timing.Griffin's declaration that he's tired of waiting for the city to get its public safety act together and will move Citadel's headquarters out of town if the situation doesn't improve is the right message at the right time about Chicago's embattled downtown jobs base.Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not want to hear it. Re-election season is the occasion for happy talk and optimism, not warnings. But as the city enters the warm-weather killing season, the message must be heard. And not just for well-off downtown businesses, either. According to data the University of Chicago Crime Lab put together for me, Chicago homicides in 2021 among Black people per 100,000 residents were at the highest level in more than 20 years\u0097and 40 times higher than among non-Latino white people. Yes, 40 times. They don't need another summer from hell.Does Lightfoot have a plan to deal with that as June, July and August roll around? Not the long-range moves to reinvest in impoverished neighborhoods that Lightfoot and every other politician within sight support, but actual plans that actually could make a difference right now?Voters can judge for themselves about whether the mayor is or is not delivering. Meanwhile, here's what other people who are running or who kicked the tires on running for mayor said when I asked them what they would do right now to prevent a summer of carnage.Ald. Rod Sawyer, 6th, said he'd fire Police Superintendent David Brown, who in his view is \"a nice guy, but over his head.\" Next on Sawyer's list is hiring people who can talk to aimless, bored youth so that police don't have to choose between filling the jails with curfew violators and ignoring the law.I heard that same thing\u0097talk to the young adults and teens who are behind much of the problem, and figure out what it will take to fix things\u0097a lot.Former Chicago Public Schools chief Paul Vallas said he'd open all public schools on weekday evenings and weekends to offer academic support amid the pandemic, serve as a base for work-study programs and most important, \"place them in safe-mentoring environments and keep them fully engaged.\" He'd also create comprehensive victim and witness protection programs and enact a nuisance ordinance that would \"hold flash mobs, looters, rioters, those that damage property and those who incite any of those actions, both criminally and civically responsible.\"State Rep. Kam Buckner, the son of a former cop, said he'd start by convening a high-level talk involving the mayor, Brown, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, Chief Cook County Circuit Court Judge Tim Evans and Sheriff Tom Dart to hammer out a highly visible, coordinated approach. He'd consider loosening qualifications for new cops\u0097i.e., allowing people with nonviolent misdemeanor violations to apply and hopefully fill a 1,000-officer shortfall. And he'd put counselors, anti-violence coordinators and others downtown, now, so that everybody isn't caught flat-footed next time trouble breaks out.Former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan would fund a \"massive\" jobs program this summer; a tired kid is probably a kid that just goes home after work. He'd end most centralized police units that pull police from neighborhoods, because the gangs \"no longer are citywide.\" And he'd place a much greater emphasis on outreach via trained anti-violence units that some research suggests make a real difference in stopping the cycle of retaliation shootings.Ald. Ray Lopez, 15th, said that, given the difficulty of recruiting police as long as Lightfoot is mayor, the city needs to double down on technology, such as cameras. Summer jobs programs shouldn't just be for kids, he added. And empty city-owned facilities should be turned into local community centers.Others I talked to, who prefer not to go public, say the jobs program really needs to be targeted at those at highest risk of committing violence. They also assert that, despite a shortage of police, the city can turn the corner in high-crime areas by sensibly deploying them in areas of need, rather than having them stand around downtown imitating scarecrows.As for Lightfoot, here's what her office said after Griffin spoke: Though some companies go, lots are coming in to Chicago. The business momentum underway is palpable.\"Sigh.",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "An ideological battle plays out in the 46th Ward",
  "Text": "One candidate says the real cure to crime is to invest in social welfare programs \u0097 and backs a bevy of new taxes and affordable-housing mandates to achieve that.A second says the choice is simple: \"You can go to the City Council with the intention of making headlines, or to be someone who gets things done.\"The third asserts she's the in-between moderate the ward needs, neither someone enamored of the Socialist left nor a product of establishment politics.Welcome to the Fightin' 46th Ward, a staggeringly diverse chunk of North Side real estate that runs from leafy Edgewater, through plucky Uptown, to upper-middle-class Lake View, with a few high-end lakefront condo towers thrown in for good measure.For a half-century now, this ward and particularly its aldermanic races have been the focus of a class war of sorts that has morphed somewhat through the years but fundamentally remained the same. This year, that contest has gone citywide with the City Council's Socialist bloc hoping to at least double the five members it now has, the equally progressive United Working Families party endorsing in 18 wards, and a biz-backed group named Get Stuff Done PAC making moves in nine wards with a few other possibilities on the horizon.I have no idea who's going to win in the 46th Ward. But the fight for control of the City Council in some ways is just as important as the battle to become mayor. And it's receiving far less media coverage.The first candidate is Angela Clay, 31, a fourth-generation Uptown resident who works as an organizer for a progressive group. Soft-spoken but firm in her views, her core convictions are best summarized by a statement on her website: \"The best way to make our communities safe is to make all of our community members safe with the housing, mental-health care, job training and violence intervention they need.\"Clay opposed a high-end apartment tower rising on a former hospital parking lot for only including eight affordable units. All new residential structures should be at least 30% affordable to keep rising prices from forcing lower-income people out, in her view. Clay has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor and says she agrees with his proposals for new levies on suburban commuters, trading on Chicago commodities exchanges and residential sales of over $1 million\u0097and she would back restoration of the jobs head tax.The second candidate is Kim Walz, 37, who works in government affairs for Walgreens and has endorsements from lots of big-name pols, including Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Gov. J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, for whom she once worked.Walz says she wants to \"preserve\" the ward's low-income housing and would set a 20% standard for new buildings, though some of the affordable units could be located elsewhere in the ward. She backed the hospital project because the developer agreed to donate a large sum to a shelter for abused women. She says the Chicago Police Department is about the right size but needs to operate more efficiently, in part by using more civilians for desk jobs. She terms it \"unconscionable\" that the city has spent so little on violence prevention and wants mental-health professionals to handle many calls that now go to police. Walz is not publicly backing anyone for mayor.The third candidate \u0097 three other contenders are on the ballot, but have not campaigned much \u0097 is Marianne Lalonde, 36, an environmental research scientist who fell just 25 votes of unseating now-retiring 46th Ward Ald. James Cappleman four years ago.\"We need an alderman who will represent all of the ward,\" says Lalonde. If she wins, she adds, she'll join the City Council's progressive caucus but not its Socialist caucus. Lalonde says she'll push for larger new units, rather than more studios and one-bedrooms. She opposed the hospital project because the land was needed for medical purposes, and she says she favors a \"multi-faceted\" approach to crime that includes everything from more detectives to more money for violence prevention. She likes Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia for mayor.Who do the voters like? We'll find out soon.",

  "Title": "Garcia faces crypto questions in mayoral race",
  "Text": "Nasty as the collapse of crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried's empire has been, equally tawdry is how Illinois members of Congress and candidates for Congress benefited from his largesse, apparently asking few if any questions while he spent tons of money on their behalf.The media has done a lousy job of pulling together the complex story of what FTX boss Bankman-Fried and associated political action funds did, covering it only in bits and pieces. Let's just say that U.S. Rep.-elect Jonathan Jackson might well not be headed to D.C. if most voters had known Bankman-Fried-funded groups were spending more than $1 million in the final stages of the race to get him elected. Jackson didn't respond to my request for comment.Most recipients were Democrats, but downstate Republican Rodney Davis got some for his failed re-election bid.Those congressional races now are history. But not the race for mayor of Chicago, where U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia is running for a new job and has $200,000 in crypto baggage to explain.The question: How and why did a PAC heavily funded by Bankman-Fried\u0097he gave Protect the Future PAC at least $27 million before his company hit the rocks\u0097come to spend $199,853 on ads and mailers this spring urging a vote for Garcia in a Democratic congressional primary race in which he was unopposed? Are Chicago voters really expected to believe that the money sort of fell off a truck and had absolutely nothing to do with Garcia's service on the House Financial Services Committee, which regulates crypto?Garcia has said little about the matter. In June, in the middle of a story that focused on Jackson, the Sun-Times reported that Garcia spoke with Bankman-Fried, but only about how the government handled the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Latinos. Garcia repeated that in a recent WTTW interview.Garcia's office said he didn't have time for an interview now. It did provide a senior adviser to his mayoral campaign, Manny Diaz, to field some questions.Diaz underlined that the money from Protect the Future\u0097it also spent $263,453 on Democrat Nikki Budzinski's successful run for a downstate congressional seat\u0097was an \"independent expenditure\" over which Garcia legally could have no control or knowledge. Right. He also noted that Bankman-Fried directly donated to lots and lots of pols all over Washington. That's true. The Biden Victory Fund got $50,000, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee $250,000 and Illinois congressional hopeful Gil Villegas $2,900. Apparently there's a lot of concern about pandemic preparation out there.But Diaz disputes that Sun-Times story. In fact, he says, Garcia spoke not with Bankman-Friedman but his brother, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, who has handled political chores for the family and, between 2019 and 2021, just happened to be on the payroll of another Illinois congressman who serves on Financial Services, Democrat Sean Casten. (Casten's spokesman says it's not clear how Gabriel Bankman-Fried got hired, but he only worked on constituent mail.)Why would the family's PAC throw all that money at Garcia? \"That's a good question. I don't know,\" Diaz replied. Shouldn't Garcia, who's running as a populist, have been wary in this matter? After all, populists such as U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., say poor FTX accounting threatens billions in customer funds and \"appears to be an appalling case of greed and deception.\"The chat between Bankman-Fried and Garcia was about the pandemic, not crypto, and political spending was not discussed, Diaz replied. He added that Garcia favors appropriate crypto rules, and that he's returned a $2,900 personal campaign contribution from Sam Bankman-Fried.So, what should voters make of this?Garcia indeed appears to have had lots of fellow travelers inside the Beltway in watching gold roll their way. Washington Republicans might find this worthier of a probe than the secrets of Hunter Biden's laptop. But voters may expect something, too, especially since money Garcia didn't have to spend promoting himself in his new district in June is still available for his mayoral campaign.Rival mayoral hopeful Paul Vallas is hopping on the issue. He contends the episode means Garcia \"is morally corrupt, that he is lazy in his stewardship of the public's trust in him, or that he is too naive to effectively guard this city from the influence of big money interests.\"Stay tuned, folks. I suspect we'll be hearing more on this one.",

  "Title": "In the final weeks, it's a wide-open mayoral race",
  "Text": "With about five weeks to go, the race for mayor of Chicago is absolutely wide open, up for at least five of the nine contenders to capture\u0097or fumble away.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is in trouble, but don't count out the wily and strong-willed incumbent. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia likely is the current leader, but he needs to quit acting like he's got it won. Close on their heels are former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, businessman Willie Wilson and, perhaps, Ald. Sophia King, 4th.In a nine-person field\u0097and after years of COVID, crime, economic decline and other woes\u0097anyone who says they know how this will turn out is smoking bad weed. If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Title": "Mayoral hopefuls, watch out for banana peels",
  "Text": "We all make mistakes. Even columnists. We all do things that, in retrospect or at a later time down the road, we wish we'd done differently. The trick is amending, explaining, making up for, changing the subject or otherwise dealing with those errors afterward.We're now entering the stretch run of a mayoral race that's tight as can be, with perhaps five candidates within reachable range of getting into shouting distance of the two-person April runoff. They've all stumbled, to one degree or another. So how are they doing removing their self-strewn banana peels?The answer: It depends on the candidate. And therein you may find out who actually wins.Let's start with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her proposal to extend Commonwealth Edison's franchise as Chicago's electricity distributor for 15 years, with a 5-year additional option.I'll take the mayor at her word that she thinks this is a really good deal, one that will provide $100 million for clean energy initiatives and reliable power for the rest of it. I'll also acknowledge that the mayor's enemies are trying to hurt her by stalling approval of a deal that she'd badly like to get done as soon as possible, and certainly before the April runoff election, if not before.That having been said, this is the ComEd that's in the papers every other day for all the shenanigans it pulled with former Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan, shenanigans that are keeping the U.S. attorney's office here quite busy. Yet, utterly tone deaf to the appearance, Lightfoot not only announced the deal and pushed for a fast vote, but also appeared at a press conference this past week with the company's new CEO, who by all accounts seems to be a good guy but is still running a company that has some reputational damage to repair. And as my colleague Steve Daniels has reported, that excellent deal would drive up your electric bill.It's a bit much to compare this scenario to Richard M. Daley's parking meter deal, as some have done. The parking meter pact literally was signed, sealed and delivered in a matter of days. But it sure is reminiscent of how this mayor handled the upcoming downtown NASCAR race and the Chicago casino deal: steamroll pushes for fast votes, with little\u0097if any\u0097true public input. It makes you just want to sigh.Then, there's candidate Brandon Johnson's decision to tax everything that moves to pay for needed social welfare programs.At Crain's Feb. 1 mayoral forum, Johnson showed signs of backing off his call to impose a tax on Metra rides as a way to squeeze all those rich suburbanites who commute to work in currently half-empty downtown Chicago. Point for him. But when asked if he's not pushing that idea as well as proposed taxes on some shopping districts, jet fuel, transactions on Chicago commodity exchanges, etc., because until very recently he was a paid staffer for the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097which wants all of those levies\u0097Cook County Commissioner Johnson responded with something about Black men needing to hold two jobs to support their families. Right.Candidate Paul Vallas outright ducked at the same forum when asked how he expects to unite a divided, majority-minority city when he sought and got an endorsement from the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police. You know the FOP. It's headed by John Catanzara, the guy who, among other things, loudly defended Jan. 6 rioters and likened Lightfoot's requirement for police officers to be vaccinated against COVID to Adolph Hitler's use of showers in extermination camps. Is that really your message, Mr. Vallas?But one other candidate came close to exorcising a past sin.Asked why he, for many years, chose to effectively partner with Madigan, participating in what amounted to a political d\u00e9tente on the Southwest Side, candidate Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia rather candidly replied that he wanted to get certain things done in Springfield and, to do so, needed the help of the then all-powerful speaker. Just because you swim with sharks doesn't make you one, as the congressman put it.That's about as honest as gets in local politics. Some of Garcia's rivals ought take notes.",

  "Title": "2023 promises to be even wilder in politics",
  "Text": "After a monumental 2022\u0097the midterm elections, SAFE-T Act controversy, the onset of a brawling mayoral race, living with COVID, et al.\u0097it's hard to imagine that 2023 could top it. Well, buckle your seat belts, folks, because all signs are the new annum will be anything but boring in the world of politics and government.Here are some of the things that will impact your life.In Springfield, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic Party, it's only a question of when lawmakers will move to ban assault weapons and limit gun magazine sizes, make it easier for out-of-state women to come to Illinois for abortions, and probably draft a proposed amendment to the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights.More fascinating, though, is what's been happening on the business side of things, where potential Democratic presidential hopeful J.B. Pritzker lately has been embellishing his pro-business bona fides, for instance moving to pay off the entire deficit in the state's unemployment trust fund.Pritzker has more work to do and knows it, since the state's job growth still is on the low side compared to other states. So keep a very close eye on whether he gets that proposed \"deal closing\" fund of up to $1 billion he wants through a liberal General Assembly, and whether that and other incentives will be enough to get Stellantis to invest a ton in converting its Belvidere plant to produce electric vehicles. This one really, really counts.Nationally, the race for president already has begun\u0097and in fact began even before the midterms. President Joe Biden now seems inclined to run again, but if he changes his mind, a ton of folks with Illinois connections are interested, including Pritzker and a former Chicago business consultant named Pete Buttigieg, now U.S. secretary of transportation.Even more interesting is what's occurring on the Republican side.Donald Trump now is in as much political trouble as he's ever been, beset not only by prosecutors and congressional probes but major figures in his own party who are beginning to say what's been clear for a while: Much as they love him in rural America (including Illinois), he's toxic in the burbs. It's far too early to write Trump off. But if it becomes clear that, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is going to be the GOP nominee, Illinois Republicans finally may have a leader who can help them stanch the bleeding. And pressure on Biden to consider retiring may increase, since Trump likely is the easiest Republican for Biden to beat.Last, but by no means least, you won't have to keep an eye on the struggle for City Hall, because it will bigfoot its way into almost every aspect of life in the metropolitan area. This augurs to be the most significant mayoral election since the Daleys passed the family business to a new generation, with the city's post-COVID economic future very much in the balance.Most of the attention will go to the mayor's race. There, a Lori Lightfoot who has some accomplishments such as increased inner-city investment also has a tendency to make unneeded enemies and is burdened by a crime wave she (and, to be fair, other mayors) just hasn't been able to control. With no giant killer among the field of challengers, Chicago business is uncertain what do. That means anything is possible. How about an April runoff between Willie Wilson and Paul Vallas? Could happen. Or Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia vs. Lightfoot?Equally meaningful are races for the City Council, which has taken a big turn toward the populist left in recent years and soon could go further. A city income tax or a \"LaSalle Street\" tax on financial transactions? Or a much-expanded real estate transfer tax that would hit owners of three-flats and \"rich\" North Side condo owners in the guise of coming up with funds to subsidize development of more affordable housing?Some other hot subjects: Will the Bally's casino glide through or hit bumps with the Illinois Gaming Board? How will local government cope with the end of big federal COVID-relief checks? Will the new downtown NASCAR race be the fiasco some expect?Like I said, quite a year ahead.",

  "Text": "Matteo Hintz proudly claims his family's union pedigree. Like many families in Chicago and Illinois, he says he \"was born and raised in a union house.\" His grandfather was a railroad switchman in Illinois, directing trains to their final destination. His father belongs to a union that represents Illinois state park superintendents.\"My dad takes union stuff very seriously because my grandpa took it seriously. And now I'm trying to do the same.\"Hintz is doing just that by organizing colleagues at the Field Museum in their second attempt to unionize. Workers at the natural history museum will begin voting in early February, with votes being counted in early March.Hintz, 26, who builds structures that encase some of the Field Museum's most priceless objects, is part of a push in labor organizing that is being led most visibly by professional and technical workers seeking not just higher wages, job security and better working conditions, but also social changes highlighted by the social justice movement. The pandemic spotlighted social and economic divides as well as those in the workplace. Workers more likely to be organizing today are school principals, health care workers, college faculty and graduate students, publishing professionals and cultural workers.This new class of union members is also younger and politically progressive. Unions, as political observers know, also play a critical role in determining who gets elected, especially in Chicago. In the mayoral race, current Mayor Lori Lightfoot has her trade union allies. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and U.S. Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda have both picked up endorsements and dollars from top influential and progressive unions.\"The pandemic changed the way people thought about their labor, changed what they wanted from work and what the workplace should be like,\" says Robert Bruno, a professor and director of the labor studies program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"It was really a change in worker consciousness.\"Over the last year, workers at some of the nation's highest-profile companies\u0097Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joe's, Apple, Microsoft, HarperCollins and Chipotle\u0097have organized.Fourteen Starbucks stores have held elections through Chicago's National Labor Relations Board office. Ten resulted in union victories. More recently, Starbucks workers at Old Orchard Mall voted 10 to 7 to unionize. Nationally, workers at 278 Starbucks stores have approved a union.Last year, the Art Institute of Chicago became the city's first major cultural institution to see employees organize. Adjunct professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago followed with their own election victory. In early January, Northwestern University graduate students voted to unionize, joining their counterparts at campuses across the country and notching one of the largest union wins in Illinois. The vote, 1,644 to 114, was a landslide victory.And later in the month, Steppenwolf Theatre workers voted decisively to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.But as workers in different industries unionize and grab headlines, organized labor nationally continues to see historic declines, and it remains unclear whether this moment will bring brief victories for wage earners or is the first phase of a larger push by workers to bargain collectively for themselves in a tight and shifting labor market.STIRRING FROM A LONG SLUMBERThe labor movement has long ties to Chicago, from the fight over the eight-hour workday and the Haymarket affair in 1886 to the Pullman railroad strike in 1894 and the Memorial Day Massacre during the \"little steel\" strikes in 1937.Even as unions saw flagging memberships in the last decades, Chicago was still at a higher rate than the national average, says Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. \"There's always something going on around unionization in Chicago,\" he says.But despite Chicago's steady union membership, Illinois has seen significant declines. Union membership in Illinois fell to 13.1% in 2022 from 20.8% in 1989. Nationally, unions followed a similar trend as the share of the workforce in labor unions dropped to 10.1%. That's the lowest on record, according to recent data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, despite union members growing by 273,000 last year. The reason for the record low: Organizing couldn't keep up with the booming job market, which added 5.3 million jobs over that same stretch, outpacing labor gains.Twenty years ago, manufacturing accounted for 2.8 million union workers nationwide. Since 2000, manufacturing has lost around 1.7 million members, a 61.6% decrease to roughly 1 million members. While the blue-collar workforce was long the bread-and-butter of industrial union organizing, new fields and industries are on the rise.In the health care sector, nurses concerned about understaffing in some cases and layoffs in others are exerting their collective power. Nurses led a quarter of the major work stoppages last year, according to BLS tracking reported by The Washington Post. In early January, 440 Howard Brown Health workers held a three-day strike at several of the health system's clinics across Chicago in response to layoffs.Workers in education services, restaurants and the gig economy at companies like Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft and Trader Joe's made union moves in recent years. Some see the sustainable-energy sector to be the next frontier for unions. The Illinois Legislature sent a bill to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's desk in early January that would relax restrictive zoning regulations that have slowed wind and solar energy projects. That could potentially bring thousands of new jobs to the state, making the industry a new target for unions.Union support is at an all-time high. Seventy-one percent of Americans now approve of labor unions, the highest Gallup has recorded on this measure since 1965, arming organizers with the power of public support.\"There's always a structural advantage for the employer, but right now, workers are finding themselves in a stronger position with more leverage and can now be more selective about where they work,\" Bruno says. That strength led in part to the \"great resignation\" of 2021, when the rate of job quitting in the U.S. reached highs not seen since the start of the BLS Job Openings &amp; Labor Turnover Survey program in December 2000.\"Millions came to realize that their jobs could really kill them during the pandemic and that the employer was probably not going to champion their best long-term interests,\" says Bruno.In 2021, the Illinois General Assembly commissioned the Illinois Future of Work Task Force, which examined challenges and opportunities related to the state's workforce. The task force, composed of policy experts, legislators and scholars, looked at how the state could best recover from the pandemic and \"confront the worsening crisis of poverty.\"Reporting in 2022, the task force concluded that it's not enough to have a job. Rather, it's job quality that matters. The report's authors recommended that the state adopt a job quality measurement; extend benefits to more workers, including independent contractors and other nontraditional workers; and expand equitable access to education and training programs for K-12 and postsecondary students to help close the racial gap in access to high-growth career pathways. The authors added that as \"workers navigate the changed economy, there has been renewed interest in unionizing.\"But employers don't always embrace union activity. Employees who organize can face anti-union rhetoric, intimidation and even job loss. An NLRB ruling in December, viewed as a victory for organized labor, expanded the fees and penalties the federal agency can collect from employers that illegally fire workers for organizing and other labor activism.\"Employees are not made whole until they are fully compensated for financial harms that they suffered as a result of unlawful conduct,\" NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said in a statement. Previously, employers that fired workers for their involvement in labor organizing only had to pay for the employee's reinstatement and lost wages.But even after employees win elections and certify their union representatives, employers can drag out contract negotiations for years. The average time it takes to agree on a first contract is 465 days, oftentimes outlasting employees in high-turnover job sectors.The University of Illinois Chicago faculty union, after winning an election in 2012, only approved its first contract in May 2014, after a faculty-led walkout led to hundreds of canceled classes and lasted two days. UIC faculty held a nearly weeklong strike earlier this month after they failed to reach a contract agreement with the school's administration over compensation and mental health services for students, among other items.A YOUNGER CROWDFor Hintz, the Field Museum worker, the summer 2020 social justice protests across the country \"lit a fire under us\" and inspired his first organizing.\"We felt the need to do something bigger after the protests,\" he says. \"We've got to make sure that everyone in the museum is being treated equally, and we have to make sure we are getting compensated adequately.\"What makes today's labor movement different are its ties to the fight for social justice and equity. \"This isn't just your mom and dad's meat and potatoes kind of union,\" Bruno says. \"There's a linkage of the political and social values of younger workers\" that the professor believes has created a new \"worker consciousness.\"Younger workers are \"now looking at the labor movement and saying, 'Hey, you know what, this is a body that can champion not just my workplace interests, but can help me promote my vision of what I want to be working for within my society,' \" Bruno says.It's exciting to see younger workers organizing this union movement at the museum, says Anna Balla, who works at the collections registrar at the Field Museum. Balla spent 12 years at the museum before management gave her a raise. She asked for the increase only after she couldn't afford rent on her old salary.\"Even then, it wasn't much, and they changed my title, but they make it feel like you should be grateful to be working at the museum and that's enough,\" says Balla, 48. \"I don't want the younger workers experiencing that.\"On college campuses, graduate students at some of the country's most elite private institutions have achieved union victories. The year started with students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology winning a union election, followed by counterparts at Yale and Northwestern universities. Next month, graduate students at the University of Chicago will cast their votes on a union, and others are expected to follow.\"Look at Amazon, look at all these different campaigns that are also happening right now,\" says Sara Bowden, a doctoral student in music theory and cognition and co-chair of Northwestern University Graduate Workers, or NUGW. \"This is a starting point for educating an entire new generation of people, like folks at private universities, about what work can mean, and I think that's going to significantly shape the way that we see labor in the future.\"NUGW says its demands include higher base stipends, paid sick days, coverage of visa renewal costs for international graduate workers and more comprehensive health insurance. The union says it will seek at least $40,000 per student in a new stipend that would put them more in line with other top private schools like Columbia, Princeton and Harvard. NU's current minimum stipend is $35,000.\"We're seeing a lot of those old-fashioned unions stepping into higher education because they understand that there's something there and there's huge potential for organizing,\" says Gali Racabi, an assistant professor who teaches labor and employment law at Cornell University. Gali believes that this new alignment of U.S. elites at Yale, Harvard and Northwestern, who are all unionized, represents an \"almost unfathomable alliance\" that makes for a potentially new kind of partnership and coalition in U.S. politics.CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONWhen Illinois Constitutional Amendment 1, or the Workers' Rights Amendment, passed, Pritzker hailed it as a major win for workers' rights in Illinois' \"rich union history.\"The amendment added language to the state's constitution that protects the rights of workers to unionize, including the ability to \"negotiate wages, hours, and working conditions, and to protect their economic welfare and safety at work.\"\"It is the strongest constitutional protection of any state in the nation,\" says Frank Manzo, executive director of the Illinois Economic Policy Institute.Surrounded by right-to-work states, which allow employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of joining a union, Illinois has cemented its place as a friend to organized labor in the Midwest, giving fuel to the belief that Illinois is hostile to business.In the past year, high-profile businesses\u0097Citadel, Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods\u0097have left the state. While these companies didn't cite labor as an issue\u0097a lot has been made of Chicago's crime problems\u0097their moves are a hit on the state's reputation, especially as these companies head to Southern states with friendlier business climates.This isn't only a big business problem, but small businesses, already hurt by inflation, will also suffer, says Todd Maisch, president of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. \"When the union reps come knocking on small businesses' doors, (businesses are) going to say, 'How much of my thin margin is this union going to take from me and is it time for me to shut the doors?' \" The terms are stark for Maisch: Unionize, and small businesses will close.Maisch doesn't see the Workers' Rights Amendment having an immediate effect. The amendment's real impact will come five years down the line, he says, after pro-union lawyers have \"expanded, expanded, expanded and expanded all interpretations and uses of the amendment.\"Manzo doesn't hold the same outlook. He points out that in this historically tight labor market, companies are in need of employees. The new union protections could help retain workers and prevent costly turnover, while also attracting higher-skilled workers, now that Illinois has some of the strongest labor protections in the country.\"Just as businesses compete for customers, they must also compete for workers,\" Manzo says. \"And winning in the market for workers is all about job quality,\" which he believes the amendment will boost.While conclusions on the amendment's fiscal consequences aren't clear, what experts do believe is that by strengthening worker protections, it will embolden a union-curious workforce. Fiscal year 2022 saw 2,510 union representation petitions filed with NLRB's 48 field offices\u0097a 53% increase from the 1,638 petitions filed in fiscal year 2021. That's the highest number since 2016 and is expected to grow in 2023.Workers \"feel a little stronger, a little more emboldened,\" Bruno says. \"I would expect organizing to increase, and workers who haven't been approached before about organizing will start to sign union cards.\"But despite decades of declining union memberships nationwide\u0097a sobering trend for organizers who were buoyed by last year's high-profile labor wins\u0097labor appears to have plenty of friends in Chicago. For Reiter of the Chicago Federation of Labor, labor will continue to grow as organizers \"drill deeper into these niche workplaces.\"FIND THE COMPLETE SERIES ONLINE ChicagoBusiness.com/CrainsForum",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "Massive O'Hare project clears last hurdle",
  "Text": "The big terminal modernization and expansion plan at O'Hare International Airport has been officially cleared for takeoff.In an announcement on Nov. 21, the Federal Aviation Administration said it has signed off on the multibillion-dollar work, concluding it is in the public interest and will not cause significant air traffic problems.The project, which will add dozens of gates and hundreds of thousands of square feet of passenger and retail space, will be one of the largest public works programs in the city's history. It will come in later and cost more than originally expected, but officials said the scope remains the same.Under the latest plan, two new remote satellite terminals will be the first to open, in 2027 and 2028, off the existing Terminal 1, where most United Airlines flights are located.Once that is done, full-scale work will begin on the centerpiece of the project: the demolition and reconstruction of Terminal 2, which will be converted into a combined domestic and international terminal. That will locate customs and related facilities at the center of the airport, and not at the somewhat remote Terminal 5, as is the case now.Officials had estimated the project's cost at $8.5 billion\u0097but that's in 2018 dollars, when the plan was unveiled and approved by the City Council under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.The total cost of the project is now $12.1 billion, Chicago's Aviation Commissioner Jamie Rhee said on Nov. 21. The increase is due to a combo of inflation and extra projects that airlines have agreed to, she said.MILESTONEThe project will be funded by federal grants and taxes on airlines and passengers, not by general city revenue like property taxes.\"This is about remaining competitive on a global stage,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who along with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made the official announcement at O'Hare on Nov. 21. \"Everything we do will have a major effect both in Chicago and throughout the country.\"Lightfoot noted that the soon-to-be-demolished Terminal 2, where last week's news conference was held, was officially opened in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. The new terminal project will be a milestone as well, she said.Rhee declined to say exactly when construction work will begin, but declared the two satellite terminals will open in 2027 and 2028.Work on the new Terminal 2 will begin in phases in 2026 and be completed along with all other projects by 2030.ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALButtigieg couldn't say for sure if Chicago will win a competition for major federal funding for the project, but he did say, \"I certainly wouldn't be surprised if a lot of strong applications from Chicago came in.\"In its statement, the FAA said it \"concluded that proposed construction projects and changes to air traffic procedures will not significantly affect any environmental resources, including noise, air quality, water resources and historic sites.\"U.S. Rep Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, who serves on the House Infrastructure Committee, also attended the news conference. He's also is running for mayor. He stood several feet to Lightfoot's left, and did not speak.",

No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "An ideological battle plays out in the 46th Ward",
  "Text": "One candidate says the real cure to crime is to invest in social welfare programs \u0097 and backs a bevy of new taxes and affordable-housing mandates to achieve that.A second says the choice is simple: \"You can go to the City Council with the intention of making headlines, or to be someone who gets things done.\"The third asserts she's the in-between moderate the ward needs, neither someone enamored of the Socialist left nor a product of establishment politics.Welcome to the Fightin' 46th Ward, a staggeringly diverse chunk of North Side real estate that runs from leafy Edgewater, through plucky Uptown, to upper-middle-class Lake View, with a few high-end lakefront condo towers thrown in for good measure.For a half-century now, this ward and particularly its aldermanic races have been the focus of a class war of sorts that has morphed somewhat through the years but fundamentally remained the same. This year, that contest has gone citywide with the City Council's Socialist bloc hoping to at least double the five members it now has, the equally progressive United Working Families party endorsing in 18 wards, and a biz-backed group named Get Stuff Done PAC making moves in nine wards with a few other possibilities on the horizon.I have no idea who's going to win in the 46th Ward. But the fight for control of the City Council in some ways is just as important as the battle to become mayor. And it's receiving far less media coverage.The first candidate is Angela Clay, 31, a fourth-generation Uptown resident who works as an organizer for a progressive group. Soft-spoken but firm in her views, her core convictions are best summarized by a statement on her website: \"The best way to make our communities safe is to make all of our community members safe with the housing, mental-health care, job training and violence intervention they need.\"Clay opposed a high-end apartment tower rising on a former hospital parking lot for only including eight affordable units. All new residential structures should be at least 30% affordable to keep rising prices from forcing lower-income people out, in her view. Clay has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor and says she agrees with his proposals for new levies on suburban commuters, trading on Chicago commodities exchanges and residential sales of over $1 million\u0097and she would back restoration of the jobs head tax.The second candidate is Kim Walz, 37, who works in government affairs for Walgreens and has endorsements from lots of big-name pols, including Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Gov. J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, for whom she once worked.Walz says she wants to \"preserve\" the ward's low-income housing and would set a 20% standard for new buildings, though some of the affordable units could be located elsewhere in the ward. She backed the hospital project because the developer agreed to donate a large sum to a shelter for abused women. She says the Chicago Police Department is about the right size but needs to operate more efficiently, in part by using more civilians for desk jobs. She terms it \"unconscionable\" that the city has spent so little on violence prevention and wants mental-health professionals to handle many calls that now go to police. Walz is not publicly backing anyone for mayor.The third candidate \u0097 three other contenders are on the ballot, but have not campaigned much \u0097 is Marianne Lalonde, 36, an environmental research scientist who fell just 25 votes of unseating now-retiring 46th Ward Ald. James Cappleman four years ago.\"We need an alderman who will represent all of the ward,\" says Lalonde. If she wins, she adds, she'll join the City Council's progressive caucus but not its Socialist caucus. Lalonde says she'll push for larger new units, rather than more studios and one-bedrooms. She opposed the hospital project because the land was needed for medical purposes, and she says she favors a \"multi-faceted\" approach to crime that includes everything from more detectives to more money for violence prevention. She likes Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia for mayor.Who do the voters like? We'll find out soon.",

  "Title": "A tax idea for the dustbin of history",
  "Text": "It took nearly four decades for Chicago business leaders to squelch the head tax, the job-killing per-employee levy rolled out by Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1974. Now, one of the contenders with a reasonably good shot at making it to the mayoral runoff this spring wants to put this bad idea\u0097and several others\u0097back on the table.As Crain's Greg Hinz reports, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson is touting a bevy of new taxes in his pitch to unseat incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Among them:A surcharge on Metra fares paid by suburban residents that Johnson argues would raise $40 million a year.A $98 million-a-year tax on jet fuel used at Chicago's airports, primarily O'Hare.A \"user fee\" on \"high-end commercial districts frequented by the wealthy, suburbanites, tourists and business travelers.\"And, of course, a $4 per worker per month employee head tax.These ideas aren't coming from some fringe write-in candidate but rather from a man many polls place in the top tier of the nine-person field heading into the Feb. 28 election. Johnson's momentum is being provided in large part by the Chicago Teachers Union, which granted him its endorsement early in the contest and stands ready to throw its get-out-the-vote army and organizing muscle behind his candidacy. Many of the ideas Johnson is touting come straight from the CTU's well-worn playbook.So it's important to take these proposals seriously\u0097and to point out in no uncertain terms how damaging they could be to Chicago's economic health.A Metra tax, at a time when ridership is still depressed and downtown office landlords and tenants are desperate to bring workers back to the Loop? Not smart. As Crain's has reported, the Regional Transportation Authority, Metra's parent, is staring down what it terms \"an existential crisis that neither fare hikes or service cuts can solve.\" The agency warns it faces a $730 million fiscal cliff by 2026 without an infusion of federal and state aid. Boosting ridership will be crucial if the transit system is to avert this crisis, making a suburban rider tax the very last thing Metra needs at this critical moment.A jet fuel tax? It's not clear that's even legal. As Hinz pointed out in his original report, bond agreements at O'Hare generally require that money raised at the airport be used to support airport projects. And a \"use fee\" for shoppers and diners in \"high-end\" neighborhoods such as, presumably, the Magnificent Mile is similarly defective. Even if such a tax could be enforced, one has to wonder: Has Johnson seen North Michigan Avenue lately?As for the head tax, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel's justification for finally putting a stake in it in 2011 was that the revenue it generated didn't offset its job-killing effects. In the 20 years after the head tax was enacted, Chicago by some accounts lost more than 250,000 jobs\u0097a virtual body blow to the city's economy. Restoring such a tax now would only make it that much harder for Chicago and the state to compete for investment.What Chicago needs in its next mayor\u0097whether it's Lightfoot or any of her challengers\u0097is a leader who understands what Chicago business owners, managers and investors are up against, and who values the contributions these people can make not only to Chicago's economic well-being but also to its civic welfare and cultural vibrancy. Chicago has a rich history as a place where business leaders are expected to get behind big public causes such as the creation of Millennium Park and the modernization of O'Hare. It's also a city where business leaders contribute considerably to philanthropic causes\u0097as is only right when those leaders are fortunate enough to do well in a town that creates the conditions for their success.Head taxes and the like, however, do little more than reinforce the notion that Chicago is hostile to business. There's no doubt this city faces enormous challenges, many of which Johnson and other candidates in the field rightly want to solve: a shortage of affordable housing, for one, inequitable distribution of investment from neighborhood to neighborhood, and a need to improve educational outcomes for all residents of the city, not just those lucky enough to make it into magnet schools. But knee-jerk \"soak the rich\" solutions to these ills not only demonstrate a lack of creativity\u0097they undercut the very idea that the people and businesses targeted by these policies could actually help provide the answers to such problems if only they could be seen as partners rather than opponents.",

  "Text": "Emma TaiAge: 38Executive director, United Working FamiliesEmma Tai began her career in politics in 2004, taking a semester away from Brown University to join Sen. John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign, an experience that initially turned her off electoral politics but now animates her work as executive director of the socialist United Working Families party.It's not that Kerry came up short, Tai says, but a feeling that she was tasked with selling voters on a candidate she believed wouldn't follow through on his bold promises to improve their lives.Following a brief stint in California after college, Tai returned to her Midwest roots to lead a nonprofit focused on youth organizing before the \"life-changing\" 2012 Chicago Teachers Union strike refocused her interest in politics.She helped then-CTU President Karen Lewis plan a mayoral run in 2015 before a cancer diagnosis prompted Lewis to step aside. Later gigs on progressive campaigns led her to United Working Families in 2016.Over the last six years, Tai has spearheaded a grassroots organizing effort that's slowly become a force in Chicago politics, including helping nine United Working Families-endorsed candidates into the City Council in 2019 and culminating in a near-sweep for Northwest Side progressive candidates in the June primary, including State Sen. Delia Ramirez's thrashing of Ald. Gilbert Villegas in the new, heavily Democratic 3rd Congressional District.Tai's ability to organize a roughly $1.5 million national outside expenditure fundraising effort to match Villegas' campaign cash was crucial to cementing Ramirez's victory.Current CTU President Stacy Davis Gates describes Tai as \"what's now\" in progressive politics.\"If Emma's at the table, there's a greater chance that we win the election, but there's a guarantee that we're going to build more movement power, we're going to build our party and we're going to expand our umbrella,\" she said.Tai is taking a senior role on Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson's mayoral campaign, which will anchor a slate looking for more City Council seats for progressives.\"Winning elections isn't something that happens in a three-month electoral cycle; it's something that happens through sustained organizing, the idea that if we do work together, things could be different,\" she says.",

  "Title": "In the final weeks, it's a wide-open mayoral race",
  "Text": "With about five weeks to go, the race for mayor of Chicago is absolutely wide open, up for at least five of the nine contenders to capture\u0097or fumble away.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is in trouble, but don't count out the wily and strong-willed incumbent. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia likely is the current leader, but he needs to quit acting like he's got it won. Close on their heels are former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, businessman Willie Wilson and, perhaps, Ald. Sophia King, 4th.In a nine-person field\u0097and after years of COVID, crime, economic decline and other woes\u0097anyone who says they know how this will turn out is smoking bad weed. If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Title": "Mayoral hopefuls, watch out for banana peels",
  "Text": "We all make mistakes. Even columnists. We all do things that, in retrospect or at a later time down the road, we wish we'd done differently. The trick is amending, explaining, making up for, changing the subject or otherwise dealing with those errors afterward.We're now entering the stretch run of a mayoral race that's tight as can be, with perhaps five candidates within reachable range of getting into shouting distance of the two-person April runoff. They've all stumbled, to one degree or another. So how are they doing removing their self-strewn banana peels?The answer: It depends on the candidate. And therein you may find out who actually wins.Let's start with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her proposal to extend Commonwealth Edison's franchise as Chicago's electricity distributor for 15 years, with a 5-year additional option.I'll take the mayor at her word that she thinks this is a really good deal, one that will provide $100 million for clean energy initiatives and reliable power for the rest of it. I'll also acknowledge that the mayor's enemies are trying to hurt her by stalling approval of a deal that she'd badly like to get done as soon as possible, and certainly before the April runoff election, if not before.That having been said, this is the ComEd that's in the papers every other day for all the shenanigans it pulled with former Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan, shenanigans that are keeping the U.S. attorney's office here quite busy. Yet, utterly tone deaf to the appearance, Lightfoot not only announced the deal and pushed for a fast vote, but also appeared at a press conference this past week with the company's new CEO, who by all accounts seems to be a good guy but is still running a company that has some reputational damage to repair. And as my colleague Steve Daniels has reported, that excellent deal would drive up your electric bill.It's a bit much to compare this scenario to Richard M. Daley's parking meter deal, as some have done. The parking meter pact literally was signed, sealed and delivered in a matter of days. But it sure is reminiscent of how this mayor handled the upcoming downtown NASCAR race and the Chicago casino deal: steamroll pushes for fast votes, with little\u0097if any\u0097true public input. It makes you just want to sigh.Then, there's candidate Brandon Johnson's decision to tax everything that moves to pay for needed social welfare programs.At Crain's Feb. 1 mayoral forum, Johnson showed signs of backing off his call to impose a tax on Metra rides as a way to squeeze all those rich suburbanites who commute to work in currently half-empty downtown Chicago. Point for him. But when asked if he's not pushing that idea as well as proposed taxes on some shopping districts, jet fuel, transactions on Chicago commodity exchanges, etc., because until very recently he was a paid staffer for the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097which wants all of those levies\u0097Cook County Commissioner Johnson responded with something about Black men needing to hold two jobs to support their families. Right.Candidate Paul Vallas outright ducked at the same forum when asked how he expects to unite a divided, majority-minority city when he sought and got an endorsement from the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police. You know the FOP. It's headed by John Catanzara, the guy who, among other things, loudly defended Jan. 6 rioters and likened Lightfoot's requirement for police officers to be vaccinated against COVID to Adolph Hitler's use of showers in extermination camps. Is that really your message, Mr. Vallas?But one other candidate came close to exorcising a past sin.Asked why he, for many years, chose to effectively partner with Madigan, participating in what amounted to a political d\u00e9tente on the Southwest Side, candidate Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia rather candidly replied that he wanted to get certain things done in Springfield and, to do so, needed the help of the then all-powerful speaker. Just because you swim with sharks doesn't make you one, as the congressman put it.That's about as honest as gets in local politics. Some of Garcia's rivals ought take notes.",

  "Title": "A WORKERS MOVEMENT IN PROGRESS",
  "Text": "Matteo Hintz proudly claims his family's union pedigree. Like many families in Chicago and Illinois, he says he \"was born and raised in a union house.\" His grandfather was a railroad switchman in Illinois, directing trains to their final destination. His father belongs to a union that represents Illinois state park superintendents.\"My dad takes union stuff very seriously because my grandpa took it seriously. And now I'm trying to do the same.\"Hintz is doing just that by organizing colleagues at the Field Museum in their second attempt to unionize. Workers at the natural history museum will begin voting in early February, with votes being counted in early March.Hintz, 26, who builds structures that encase some of the Field Museum's most priceless objects, is part of a push in labor organizing that is being led most visibly by professional and technical workers seeking not just higher wages, job security and better working conditions, but also social changes highlighted by the social justice movement. The pandemic spotlighted social and economic divides as well as those in the workplace. Workers more likely to be organizing today are school principals, health care workers, college faculty and graduate students, publishing professionals and cultural workers.This new class of union members is also younger and politically progressive. Unions, as political observers know, also play a critical role in determining who gets elected, especially in Chicago. In the mayoral race, current Mayor Lori Lightfoot has her trade union allies. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and U.S. Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda have both picked up endorsements and dollars from top influential and progressive unions.\"The pandemic changed the way people thought about their labor, changed what they wanted from work and what the workplace should be like,\" says Robert Bruno, a professor and director of the labor studies program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"It was really a change in worker consciousness.\"Over the last year, workers at some of the nation's highest-profile companies\u0097Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joe's, Apple, Microsoft, HarperCollins and Chipotle\u0097have organized.Fourteen Starbucks stores have held elections through Chicago's National Labor Relations Board office. Ten resulted in union victories. More recently, Starbucks workers at Old Orchard Mall voted 10 to 7 to unionize. Nationally, workers at 278 Starbucks stores have approved a union.Last year, the Art Institute of Chicago became the city's first major cultural institution to see employees organize. Adjunct professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago followed with their own election victory. In early January, Northwestern University graduate students voted to unionize, joining their counterparts at campuses across the country and notching one of the largest union wins in Illinois. The vote, 1,644 to 114, was a landslide victory.And later in the month, Steppenwolf Theatre workers voted decisively to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.But as workers in different industries unionize and grab headlines, organized labor nationally continues to see historic declines, and it remains unclear whether this moment will bring brief victories for wage earners or is the first phase of a larger push by workers to bargain collectively for themselves in a tight and shifting labor market.STIRRING FROM A LONG SLUMBERThe labor movement has long ties to Chicago, from the fight over the eight-hour workday and the Haymarket affair in 1886 to the Pullman railroad strike in 1894 and the Memorial Day Massacre during the \"little steel\" strikes in 1937.Even as unions saw flagging memberships in the last decades, Chicago was still at a higher rate than the national average, says Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. \"There's always something going on around unionization in Chicago,\" he says.But despite Chicago's steady union membership, Illinois has seen significant declines. Union membership in Illinois fell to 13.1% in 2022 from 20.8% in 1989. Nationally, unions followed a similar trend as the share of the workforce in labor unions dropped to 10.1%. That's the lowest on record, according to recent data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, despite union members growing by 273,000 last year. The reason for the record low: Organizing couldn't keep up with the booming job market, which added 5.3 million jobs over that same stretch, outpacing labor gains.Twenty years ago, manufacturing accounted for 2.8 million union workers nationwide. Since 2000, manufacturing has lost around 1.7 million members, a 61.6% decrease to roughly 1 million members. While the blue-collar workforce was long the bread-and-butter of industrial union organizing, new fields and industries are on the rise.In the health care sector, nurses concerned about understaffing in some cases and layoffs in others are exerting their collective power. Nurses led a quarter of the major work stoppages last year, according to BLS tracking reported by The Washington Post. In early January, 440 Howard Brown Health workers held a three-day strike at several of the health system's clinics across Chicago in response to layoffs.Workers in education services, restaurants and the gig economy at companies like Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft and Trader Joe's made union moves in recent years. Some see the sustainable-energy sector to be the next frontier for unions. The Illinois Legislature sent a bill to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's desk in early January that would relax restrictive zoning regulations that have slowed wind and solar energy projects. That could potentially bring thousands of new jobs to the state, making the industry a new target for unions.Union support is at an all-time high. Seventy-one percent of Americans now approve of labor unions, the highest Gallup has recorded on this measure since 1965, arming organizers with the power of public support.\"There's always a structural advantage for the employer, but right now, workers are finding themselves in a stronger position with more leverage and can now be more selective about where they work,\" Bruno says. That strength led in part to the \"great resignation\" of 2021, when the rate of job quitting in the U.S. reached highs not seen since the start of the BLS Job Openings &amp; Labor Turnover Survey program in December 2000.\"Millions came to realize that their jobs could really kill them during the pandemic and that the employer was probably not going to champion their best long-term interests,\" says Bruno.In 2021, the Illinois General Assembly commissioned the Illinois Future of Work Task Force, which examined challenges and opportunities related to the state's workforce. The task force, composed of policy experts, legislators and scholars, looked at how the state could best recover from the pandemic and \"confront the worsening crisis of poverty.\"Reporting in 2022, the task force concluded that it's not enough to have a job. Rather, it's job quality that matters. The report's authors recommended that the state adopt a job quality measurement; extend benefits to more workers, including independent contractors and other nontraditional workers; and expand equitable access to education and training programs for K-12 and postsecondary students to help close the racial gap in access to high-growth career pathways. The authors added that as \"workers navigate the changed economy, there has been renewed interest in unionizing.\"But employers don't always embrace union activity. Employees who organize can face anti-union rhetoric, intimidation and even job loss. An NLRB ruling in December, viewed as a victory for organized labor, expanded the fees and penalties the federal agency can collect from employers that illegally fire workers for organizing and other labor activism.\"Employees are not made whole until they are fully compensated for financial harms that they suffered as a result of unlawful conduct,\" NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said in a statement. Previously, employers that fired workers for their involvement in labor organizing only had to pay for the employee's reinstatement and lost wages.But even after employees win elections and certify their union representatives, employers can drag out contract negotiations for years. The average time it takes to agree on a first contract is 465 days, oftentimes outlasting employees in high-turnover job sectors.The University of Illinois Chicago faculty union, after winning an election in 2012, only approved its first contract in May 2014, after a faculty-led walkout led to hundreds of canceled classes and lasted two days. UIC faculty held a nearly weeklong strike earlier this month after they failed to reach a contract agreement with the school's administration over compensation and mental health services for students, among other items.A YOUNGER CROWDFor Hintz, the Field Museum worker, the summer 2020 social justice protests across the country \"lit a fire under us\" and inspired his first organizing.\"We felt the need to do something bigger after the protests,\" he says. \"We've got to make sure that everyone in the museum is being treated equally, and we have to make sure we are getting compensated adequately.\"What makes today's labor movement different are its ties to the fight for social justice and equity. \"This isn't just your mom and dad's meat and potatoes kind of union,\" Bruno says. \"There's a linkage of the political and social values of younger workers\" that the professor believes has created a new \"worker consciousness.\"Younger workers are \"now looking at the labor movement and saying, 'Hey, you know what, this is a body that can champion not just my workplace interests, but can help me promote my vision of what I want to be working for within my society,' \" Bruno says.It's exciting to see younger workers organizing this union movement at the museum, says Anna Balla, who works at the collections registrar at the Field Museum. Balla spent 12 years at the museum before management gave her a raise. She asked for the increase only after she couldn't afford rent on her old salary.\"Even then, it wasn't much, and they changed my title, but they make it feel like you should be grateful to be working at the museum and that's enough,\" says Balla, 48. \"I don't want the younger workers experiencing that.\"On college campuses, graduate students at some of the country's most elite private institutions have achieved union victories. The year started with students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology winning a union election, followed by counterparts at Yale and Northwestern universities. Next month, graduate students at the University of Chicago will cast their votes on a union, and others are expected to follow.\"Look at Amazon, look at all these different campaigns that are also happening right now,\" says Sara Bowden, a doctoral student in music theory and cognition and co-chair of Northwestern University Graduate Workers, or NUGW. \"This is a starting point for educating an entire new generation of people, like folks at private universities, about what work can mean, and I think that's going to significantly shape the way that we see labor in the future.\"NUGW says its demands include higher base stipends, paid sick days, coverage of visa renewal costs for international graduate workers and more comprehensive health insurance. The union says it will seek at least $40,000 per student in a new stipend that would put them more in line with other top private schools like Columbia, Princeton and Harvard. NU's current minimum stipend is $35,000.\"We're seeing a lot of those old-fashioned unions stepping into higher education because they understand that there's something there and there's huge potential for organizing,\" says Gali Racabi, an assistant professor who teaches labor and employment law at Cornell University. Gali believes that this new alignment of U.S. elites at Yale, Harvard and Northwestern, who are all unionized, represents an \"almost unfathomable alliance\" that makes for a potentially new kind of partnership and coalition in U.S. politics.CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONWhen Illinois Constitutional Amendment 1, or the Workers' Rights Amendment, passed, Pritzker hailed it as a major win for workers' rights in Illinois' \"rich union history.\"The amendment added language to the state's constitution that protects the rights of workers to unionize, including the ability to \"negotiate wages, hours, and working conditions, and to protect their economic welfare and safety at work.\"\"It is the strongest constitutional protection of any state in the nation,\" says Frank Manzo, executive director of the Illinois Economic Policy Institute.Surrounded by right-to-work states, which allow employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of joining a union, Illinois has cemented its place as a friend to organized labor in the Midwest, giving fuel to the belief that Illinois is hostile to business.In the past year, high-profile businesses\u0097Citadel, Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods\u0097have left the state. While these companies didn't cite labor as an issue\u0097a lot has been made of Chicago's crime problems\u0097their moves are a hit on the state's reputation, especially as these companies head to Southern states with friendlier business climates.This isn't only a big business problem, but small businesses, already hurt by inflation, will also suffer, says Todd Maisch, president of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. \"When the union reps come knocking on small businesses' doors, (businesses are) going to say, 'How much of my thin margin is this union going to take from me and is it time for me to shut the doors?' \" The terms are stark for Maisch: Unionize, and small businesses will close.Maisch doesn't see the Workers' Rights Amendment having an immediate effect. The amendment's real impact will come five years down the line, he says, after pro-union lawyers have \"expanded, expanded, expanded and expanded all interpretations and uses of the amendment.\"Manzo doesn't hold the same outlook. He points out that in this historically tight labor market, companies are in need of employees. The new union protections could help retain workers and prevent costly turnover, while also attracting higher-skilled workers, now that Illinois has some of the strongest labor protections in the country.\"Just as businesses compete for customers, they must also compete for workers,\" Manzo says. \"And winning in the market for workers is all about job quality,\" which he believes the amendment will boost.While conclusions on the amendment's fiscal consequences aren't clear, what experts do believe is that by strengthening worker protections, it will embolden a union-curious workforce. Fiscal year 2022 saw 2,510 union representation petitions filed with NLRB's 48 field offices\u0097a 53% increase from the 1,638 petitions filed in fiscal year 2021. That's the highest number since 2016 and is expected to grow in 2023.Workers \"feel a little stronger, a little more emboldened,\" Bruno says. \"I would expect organizing to increase, and workers who haven't been approached before about organizing will start to sign union cards.\"But despite decades of declining union memberships nationwide\u0097a sobering trend for organizers who were buoyed by last year's high-profile labor wins\u0097labor appears to have plenty of friends in Chicago. For Reiter of the Chicago Federation of Labor, labor will continue to grow as organizers \"drill deeper into these niche workplaces.\"FIND THE COMPLETE SERIES ONLINE ChicagoBusiness.com/CrainsForum",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council.

  "Title": "What's up with this aldermanic exodus?",
  "Text": "So far, Chicago's once-potent and influential business community mostly has watched as the race for mayor has unfolded. Perhaps that will change as the list of candidates narrows and leaders face the reality of whether Lori Lightfoot has earned another four years in office.Meanwhile, another item that also will be on the city ballot in February has exploded in importance: The question of who will be elected to the City Council at a time when moderates seem to be on the run and budget-busting, police-phobic Democratic Socialists are building power.The dog days of summer brought a flood of aldermanic retirements, some welcome but collectively big enough to raise a real question of whether people who know how to govern and not just issue fiats will be in charge after the votes are counted.The departure list is particularly noticeable along the lakefront\u0097and not just on the North Side, but all the way south to Hyde Park and South Shore. That's the area that long has been ruled by relative moderates, people who believe in social services but realize budgets need to be balanced, folks who favor political and police reform but also value reasonable law enforcement.That was then. What happens next is an open question.COMMONALITIESGoing for sure or already gone are Alds. Harry Osterman, 48th; James Cappleman, 46th; Tom Tunney, 44th; Michele Smith, 43rd; Sophia King, 4th; and Leslie Hairston, 5th. Only three lakefront council members remain: Alds. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, who says he's staying put; Brian Hopkins, 2nd, who's been mulling a race for mayor; and Pat Dowell, 3rd, who in June came up just short in a race for Congress. (More members headed out the door include Alds. Carrie Austin, 34th, indicted last year on bribery charges; Roderick Sawyer, 6th, and Ray Lopez, 15th, both challenging Lightfoot; and George Cardenas, 12th, aiming to join the Cook County Board of Review.)The reasons for the departures vary from person to person. But there are some commonalities.For one, just about everyone on the departure list has been around for a while; in many cases, a long while. New blood is good, but so is experience.Another commonality is that no one in that group gets along very well with Lightfoot at the moment, even though some ranked high on the mayor's City Council team. Like Tunney, who chairs the Zoning Committee and guided through Lightfoot's selection of a River West site for the city's casino, but told the Sun-Times that being an alderman isn't much fun right now.If I was Lightfoot, I'd be a little worried that my lieutenants are jumping ship.BALANCING ACTAnother reason for the exits: Lightfoot's priorities \"do not include downtown or the lakefront,\" says one retiring alderman who asked not to be named. But on issues such as property taxes, casino locations, law enforcement and the like, \"You've got to have a mayor for the whole city.\" Left unsaid is the reality: A mayor needs to find the right balance on issues such as property taxes and police strategy. If they don't, the city as a whole suffers.One top business leader says his group is aware of the particular importance of this cycle of upcoming City Council elections and will play its cards accordingly.The current wave of retirements is \" unprecedented,\" says Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce CEO Jack Lavin. \"A lot of people look at the mayor's race. But we need a core of supporters in the City Council, too.\"Lavin promises money and help are coming to candidates in wards that\u0097perhaps including the 46th\u0097look like they'll have a clear aldermanic choice. \"We're not afraid to get involved,\" Lavin puts it. \"We're putting it together. We'll have more to say soon.\"For the city's sake, I hope so. As I wrote recently, Chicago's post-COVID economic recovery seems to be caught in a one-step-forward, one-step-back cycle, with some good news but also continuing reversals. A dramatic change in City Council control could tilt things beyond repair.",

  "Title": "In the final weeks, it's a wide-open mayoral race",
  "Text": "With about five weeks to go, the race for mayor of Chicago is absolutely wide open, up for at least five of the nine contenders to capture\u0097or fumble away.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is in trouble, but don't count out the wily and strong-willed incumbent. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia likely is the current leader, but he needs to quit acting like he's got it won. Close on their heels are former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, businessman Willie Wilson and, perhaps, Ald. Sophia King, 4th.In a nine-person field\u0097and after years of COVID, crime, economic decline and other woes\u0097anyone who says they know how this will turn out is smoking bad weed. If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Title": "Garcia faces crypto questions in mayoral race",
  "Text": "Nasty as the collapse of crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried's empire has been, equally tawdry is how Illinois members of Congress and candidates for Congress benefited from his largesse, apparently asking few if any questions while he spent tons of money on their behalf.The media has done a lousy job of pulling together the complex story of what FTX boss Bankman-Fried and associated political action funds did, covering it only in bits and pieces. Let's just say that U.S. Rep.-elect Jonathan Jackson might well not be headed to D.C. if most voters had known Bankman-Fried-funded groups were spending more than $1 million in the final stages of the race to get him elected. Jackson didn't respond to my request for comment.Most recipients were Democrats, but downstate Republican Rodney Davis got some for his failed re-election bid.Those congressional races now are history. But not the race for mayor of Chicago, where U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia is running for a new job and has $200,000 in crypto baggage to explain.The question: How and why did a PAC heavily funded by Bankman-Fried\u0097he gave Protect the Future PAC at least $27 million before his company hit the rocks\u0097come to spend $199,853 on ads and mailers this spring urging a vote for Garcia in a Democratic congressional primary race in which he was unopposed? Are Chicago voters really expected to believe that the money sort of fell off a truck and had absolutely nothing to do with Garcia's service on the House Financial Services Committee, which regulates crypto?Garcia has said little about the matter. In June, in the middle of a story that focused on Jackson, the Sun-Times reported that Garcia spoke with Bankman-Fried, but only about how the government handled the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Latinos. Garcia repeated that in a recent WTTW interview.Garcia's office said he didn't have time for an interview now. It did provide a senior adviser to his mayoral campaign, Manny Diaz, to field some questions.Diaz underlined that the money from Protect the Future\u0097it also spent $263,453 on Democrat Nikki Budzinski's successful run for a downstate congressional seat\u0097was an \"independent expenditure\" over which Garcia legally could have no control or knowledge. Right. He also noted that Bankman-Fried directly donated to lots and lots of pols all over Washington. That's true. The Biden Victory Fund got $50,000, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee $250,000 and Illinois congressional hopeful Gil Villegas $2,900. Apparently there's a lot of concern about pandemic preparation out there.But Diaz disputes that Sun-Times story. In fact, he says, Garcia spoke not with Bankman-Friedman but his brother, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, who has handled political chores for the family and, between 2019 and 2021, just happened to be on the payroll of another Illinois congressman who serves on Financial Services, Democrat Sean Casten. (Casten's spokesman says it's not clear how Gabriel Bankman-Fried got hired, but he only worked on constituent mail.)Why would the family's PAC throw all that money at Garcia? \"That's a good question. I don't know,\" Diaz replied. Shouldn't Garcia, who's running as a populist, have been wary in this matter? After all, populists such as U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., say poor FTX accounting threatens billions in customer funds and \"appears to be an appalling case of greed and deception.\"The chat between Bankman-Fried and Garcia was about the pandemic, not crypto, and political spending was not discussed, Diaz replied. He added that Garcia favors appropriate crypto rules, and that he's returned a $2,900 personal campaign contribution from Sam Bankman-Fried.So, what should voters make of this?Garcia indeed appears to have had lots of fellow travelers inside the Beltway in watching gold roll their way. Washington Republicans might find this worthier of a probe than the secrets of Hunter Biden's laptop. But voters may expect something, too, especially since money Garcia didn't have to spend promoting himself in his new district in June is still available for his mayoral campaign.Rival mayoral hopeful Paul Vallas is hopping on the issue. He contends the episode means Garcia \"is morally corrupt, that he is lazy in his stewardship of the public's trust in him, or that he is too naive to effectively guard this city from the influence of big money interests.\"Stay tuned, folks. I suspect we'll be hearing more on this one.",

  "Title": "In the final weeks, it's a wide-open mayoral race",
  "Text": "With about five weeks to go, the race for mayor of Chicago is absolutely wide open, up for at least five of the nine contenders to capture\u0097or fumble away.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is in trouble, but don't count out the wily and strong-willed incumbent. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia likely is the current leader, but he needs to quit acting like he's got it won. Close on their heels are former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, businessman Willie Wilson and, perhaps, Ald. Sophia King, 4th.In a nine-person field\u0097and after years of COVID, crime, economic decline and other woes\u0097anyone who says they know how this will turn out is smoking bad weed. If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Title": "Mayoral hopefuls, watch out for banana peels",
  "Text": "We all make mistakes. Even columnists. We all do things that, in retrospect or at a later time down the road, we wish we'd done differently. The trick is amending, explaining, making up for, changing the subject or otherwise dealing with those errors afterward.We're now entering the stretch run of a mayoral race that's tight as can be, with perhaps five candidates within reachable range of getting into shouting distance of the two-person April runoff. They've all stumbled, to one degree or another. So how are they doing removing their self-strewn banana peels?The answer: It depends on the candidate. And therein you may find out who actually wins.Let's start with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her proposal to extend Commonwealth Edison's franchise as Chicago's electricity distributor for 15 years, with a 5-year additional option.I'll take the mayor at her word that she thinks this is a really good deal, one that will provide $100 million for clean energy initiatives and reliable power for the rest of it. I'll also acknowledge that the mayor's enemies are trying to hurt her by stalling approval of a deal that she'd badly like to get done as soon as possible, and certainly before the April runoff election, if not before.That having been said, this is the ComEd that's in the papers every other day for all the shenanigans it pulled with former Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan, shenanigans that are keeping the U.S. attorney's office here quite busy. Yet, utterly tone deaf to the appearance, Lightfoot not only announced the deal and pushed for a fast vote, but also appeared at a press conference this past week with the company's new CEO, who by all accounts seems to be a good guy but is still running a company that has some reputational damage to repair. And as my colleague Steve Daniels has reported, that excellent deal would drive up your electric bill.It's a bit much to compare this scenario to Richard M. Daley's parking meter deal, as some have done. The parking meter pact literally was signed, sealed and delivered in a matter of days. But it sure is reminiscent of how this mayor handled the upcoming downtown NASCAR race and the Chicago casino deal: steamroll pushes for fast votes, with little\u0097if any\u0097true public input. It makes you just want to sigh.Then, there's candidate Brandon Johnson's decision to tax everything that moves to pay for needed social welfare programs.At Crain's Feb. 1 mayoral forum, Johnson showed signs of backing off his call to impose a tax on Metra rides as a way to squeeze all those rich suburbanites who commute to work in currently half-empty downtown Chicago. Point for him. But when asked if he's not pushing that idea as well as proposed taxes on some shopping districts, jet fuel, transactions on Chicago commodity exchanges, etc., because until very recently he was a paid staffer for the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097which wants all of those levies\u0097Cook County Commissioner Johnson responded with something about Black men needing to hold two jobs to support their families. Right.Candidate Paul Vallas outright ducked at the same forum when asked how he expects to unite a divided, majority-minority city when he sought and got an endorsement from the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police. You know the FOP. It's headed by John Catanzara, the guy who, among other things, loudly defended Jan. 6 rioters and likened Lightfoot's requirement for police officers to be vaccinated against COVID to Adolph Hitler's use of showers in extermination camps. Is that really your message, Mr. Vallas?But one other candidate came close to exorcising a past sin.Asked why he, for many years, chose to effectively partner with Madigan, participating in what amounted to a political d\u00e9tente on the Southwest Side, candidate Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia rather candidly replied that he wanted to get certain things done in Springfield and, to do so, needed the help of the then all-powerful speaker. Just because you swim with sharks doesn't make you one, as the congressman put it.That's about as honest as gets in local politics. Some of Garcia's rivals ought take notes.",

  "Title": "2023 promises to be even wilder in politics",
  "Text": "After a monumental 2022\u0097the midterm elections, SAFE-T Act controversy, the onset of a brawling mayoral race, living with COVID, et al.\u0097it's hard to imagine that 2023 could top it. Well, buckle your seat belts, folks, because all signs are the new annum will be anything but boring in the world of politics and government.Here are some of the things that will impact your life.In Springfield, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic Party, it's only a question of when lawmakers will move to ban assault weapons and limit gun magazine sizes, make it easier for out-of-state women to come to Illinois for abortions, and probably draft a proposed amendment to the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights.More fascinating, though, is what's been happening on the business side of things, where potential Democratic presidential hopeful J.B. Pritzker lately has been embellishing his pro-business bona fides, for instance moving to pay off the entire deficit in the state's unemployment trust fund.Pritzker has more work to do and knows it, since the state's job growth still is on the low side compared to other states. So keep a very close eye on whether he gets that proposed \"deal closing\" fund of up to $1 billion he wants through a liberal General Assembly, and whether that and other incentives will be enough to get Stellantis to invest a ton in converting its Belvidere plant to produce electric vehicles. This one really, really counts.Nationally, the race for president already has begun\u0097and in fact began even before the midterms. President Joe Biden now seems inclined to run again, but if he changes his mind, a ton of folks with Illinois connections are interested, including Pritzker and a former Chicago business consultant named Pete Buttigieg, now U.S. secretary of transportation.Even more interesting is what's occurring on the Republican side.Donald Trump now is in as much political trouble as he's ever been, beset not only by prosecutors and congressional probes but major figures in his own party who are beginning to say what's been clear for a while: Much as they love him in rural America (including Illinois), he's toxic in the burbs. It's far too early to write Trump off. But if it becomes clear that, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is going to be the GOP nominee, Illinois Republicans finally may have a leader who can help them stanch the bleeding. And pressure on Biden to consider retiring may increase, since Trump likely is the easiest Republican for Biden to beat.Last, but by no means least, you won't have to keep an eye on the struggle for City Hall, because it will bigfoot its way into almost every aspect of life in the metropolitan area. This augurs to be the most significant mayoral election since the Daleys passed the family business to a new generation, with the city's post-COVID economic future very much in the balance.Most of the attention will go to the mayor's race. There, a Lori Lightfoot who has some accomplishments such as increased inner-city investment also has a tendency to make unneeded enemies and is burdened by a crime wave she (and, to be fair, other mayors) just hasn't been able to control. With no giant killer among the field of challengers, Chicago business is uncertain what do. That means anything is possible. How about an April runoff between Willie Wilson and Paul Vallas? Could happen. Or Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia vs. Lightfoot?Equally meaningful are races for the City Council, which has taken a big turn toward the populist left in recent years and soon could go further. A city income tax or a \"LaSalle Street\" tax on financial transactions? Or a much-expanded real estate transfer tax that would hit owners of three-flats and \"rich\" North Side condo owners in the guise of coming up with funds to subsidize development of more affordable housing?Some other hot subjects: Will the Bally's casino glide through or hit bumps with the Illinois Gaming Board? How will local government cope with the end of big federal COVID-relief checks? Will the new downtown NASCAR race be the fiasco some expect?Like I said, quite a year ahead.",

  "Title": "Lightfoot should listen to Griffin",
  "Text": "Whatever you think of Ken Griffin's politics\u0097too conservative for my taste\u0097you have to acknowledge his sense of timing.Griffin's declaration that he's tired of waiting for the city to get its public safety act together and will move Citadel's headquarters out of town if the situation doesn't improve is the right message at the right time about Chicago's embattled downtown jobs base.Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not want to hear it. Re-election season is the occasion for happy talk and optimism, not warnings. But as the city enters the warm-weather killing season, the message must be heard. And not just for well-off downtown businesses, either. According to data the University of Chicago Crime Lab put together for me, Chicago homicides in 2021 among Black people per 100,000 residents were at the highest level in more than 20 years\u0097and 40 times higher than among non-Latino white people. Yes, 40 times. They don't need another summer from hell.Does Lightfoot have a plan to deal with that as June, July and August roll around? Not the long-range moves to reinvest in impoverished neighborhoods that Lightfoot and every other politician within sight support, but actual plans that actually could make a difference right now?Voters can judge for themselves about whether the mayor is or is not delivering. Meanwhile, here's what other people who are running or who kicked the tires on running for mayor said when I asked them what they would do right now to prevent a summer of carnage.Ald. Rod Sawyer, 6th, said he'd fire Police Superintendent David Brown, who in his view is \"a nice guy, but over his head.\" Next on Sawyer's list is hiring people who can talk to aimless, bored youth so that police don't have to choose between filling the jails with curfew violators and ignoring the law.I heard that same thing\u0097talk to the young adults and teens who are behind much of the problem, and figure out what it will take to fix things\u0097a lot.Former Chicago Public Schools chief Paul Vallas said he'd open all public schools on weekday evenings and weekends to offer academic support amid the pandemic, serve as a base for work-study programs and most important, \"place them in safe-mentoring environments and keep them fully engaged.\" He'd also create comprehensive victim and witness protection programs and enact a nuisance ordinance that would \"hold flash mobs, looters, rioters, those that damage property and those who incite any of those actions, both criminally and civically responsible.\"State Rep. Kam Buckner, the son of a former cop, said he'd start by convening a high-level talk involving the mayor, Brown, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, Chief Cook County Circuit Court Judge Tim Evans and Sheriff Tom Dart to hammer out a highly visible, coordinated approach. He'd consider loosening qualifications for new cops\u0097i.e., allowing people with nonviolent misdemeanor violations to apply and hopefully fill a 1,000-officer shortfall. And he'd put counselors, anti-violence coordinators and others downtown, now, so that everybody isn't caught flat-footed next time trouble breaks out.Former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan would fund a \"massive\" jobs program this summer; a tired kid is probably a kid that just goes home after work. He'd end most centralized police units that pull police from neighborhoods, because the gangs \"no longer are citywide.\" And he'd place a much greater emphasis on outreach via trained anti-violence units that some research suggests make a real difference in stopping the cycle of retaliation shootings.Ald. Ray Lopez, 15th, said that, given the difficulty of recruiting police as long as Lightfoot is mayor, the city needs to double down on technology, such as cameras. Summer jobs programs shouldn't just be for kids, he added. And empty city-owned facilities should be turned into local community centers.Others I talked to, who prefer not to go public, say the jobs program really needs to be targeted at those at highest risk of committing violence. They also assert that, despite a shortage of police, the city can turn the corner in high-crime areas by sensibly deploying them in areas of need, rather than having them stand around downtown imitating scarecrows.As for Lightfoot, here's what her office said after Griffin spoke: Though some companies go, lots are coming in to Chicago. The business momentum underway is palpable.\"Sigh.",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "Is the CTA finally taking security seriously?",
  "Text": "I saw something when I got on the el the other day that I hadn't seen in, well, probably a year and a half. That was two Chicago police officers\u0097not unarmed and barely awake \"security\" personnel, mind you, but actual cops.Is it the first robin of spring? Or at least a recognition by City Hall and the Chicago Transit Authority that they've got a first-class security problem on their hands as mayoral election season approaches? I certainly hope so.I first wrote about this situation way back in March 2021. At that time, police and the CTA said they were doing their best, and predicted improvement with more time, especially as largely self-policing crowds of commuters returned to work. Since then, the commuters have returned, sort of, with CTA ridership up to about half of what it was pre-pandemic. Police have added more staffers, the CTA has hired security guards and things are somewhat improved.But not enough. Just this last week, the Chicago Tribune reported police would be boosting their presence on the CTA, even pulling some people off desk duty, after a 29-year-old man was shot to death on the Red Line. A few days earlier, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that, even though ridership is still down by almost half, the number of violent crimes on CTA vehicles through July 19 is the highest it's been since 2011, and the second highest in two decades.Given all that, CTA President Dorval Carter is trying again.In a presentation at the City Club of Chicago, he rejected a proposal from mayoral hopeful Willie Wilson to reform the CTA's own police unit, saying it would take two years to do so and that the CTA would face the same challenges hiring qualified staff that the Chicago Police Department does. But he laid out a series of other initiatives, including adding K-9 units, adding higher fare gates to el stations to keep fare jumpers and other troublemakers from entering, and spiffing up the look of dozens of stations so they don't appear quite so forlorn.Carter even unveiled a new initiative about how to cope with sometimes dozens of homeless people, some of them with addiction problems, who occupy trains, especially in cold-weather months. Trying to walk a fine line between protecting his customers and extending a hand to those in need, Carter said the CTA this winter will be partnering with social-service agencies who will \"engage\" homeless people on the system. Carter said he's \"not talking about\" throwing people off the trains wholesale, as they're doing in New York City. \"I'm talking about getting people who really need help, help.\"I hope it works. Just like I hope Carter's parallel plan to adjust CTA schedules to reality works, too. Instead of sticking to a pre-pandemic schedule the agency clearly cannot meet because of a shortage of workers, it instead will release schedules that may appear stretched out but actually are achievable.\"The pandemic changed everything,\" Carter summarized. \"There's no road map on how to maneuver a pandemic.\"On balance, it looks likes the gravity of the situation finally has sunk in\u0097at CTA headquarters and, more important, in Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office, which has had a bad case of rose-colored glassism on this subject.Chicago's economy, particularly the downtown economy, will not recover without a transit system that works and that people are unafraid to use. I've seen stuff on the CTA in the last year I thought I'd never see. I don't know how many friends and associates and co-workers I know who biked to work, or took three buses, because they're afraid to get on the train.The clock is ticking on this one. With huge federal COVID-relief aid that's been supporting CTA operations starting to phase out after next year, the CTA only has so long to get its house in order and lure back riders. I wish Carter luck. I fear he'll need it.",

  "Title": "City Council gets it right",
  "Text": "Kudos to Chicago aldermen for refusing to fast-track Mayor Lori Lightfoot's proposed franchise extension for electric utility Commonwealth Edison.If Chicago history teaches anything, it's that massive, multiyear municipal contracts involving hundreds of millions of dollars shouldn't be rushed through the City Council to meet artificial deadlines. Although the parallel isn't exact, Lightfoot's push for a quick council vote on the ComEd extension triggers unhappy memories of predecessor Richard M. Daley's infamous 75-year parking meter lease.Council members caved to Daley's demand for fast signoff on that deal, now widely recognized as a multibillion-dollar giveaway to Wall Street. Thankfully, aldermen are resisting mayoral pressure to quickly approve a 15-year extension of ComEd's lucrative franchise. After Lightfoot introduced her proposal on Feb. 1, they sidelined it in the Rules Committee and declined to schedule a special meeting to consider it the following week.A commitment of such magnitude, complexity and duration needs thorough and unhurried scrutiny, not a rushed review ahead of this month's municipal elections, which could usher in a new mayor and flip many council seats.Aldermen are raising important questions, such as the wisdom of awarding such a long electricity franchise at a time of great change and uncertainty in energy markets. They also wonder why the city should enter a long-term partnership with a company that admitted bribing state lawmakers to pass legislation that cost customers hundreds of millions in rate increases. On that score, some note that pending trials of company executives could shed more light on ComEd's shady dealings and their impact on customers. Others want more consumer protections.CRITICISMLightfoot's proposed deal goes far beyond a straightforward renewal of ComEd's franchise agreement, which expired two years ago. ComEd would pay Chicago an annual franchise fee of $90 million to $100 million and pass the cost along to customers.The proposal also envisions a smorgasbord of clean energy and workforce development initiatives purportedly worth more than $500 million. ComEd would fund many of them by contributing up to $120 million to a new nonprofit that would dole out the cash to projects deemed worthy.ComEd also promises to build a $32.5 million job-training center on the West Side to train 10,000 people for clean energy jobs, and to hire 1,000 construction and customer service workers from the South and West sides. On top of that, the utility and the city agree to seek $400 million in outside funding for other investments, including 4,000 solar panels for low-income residents, solar energy workshops and affordable broadband service on ComEd dark fiber.Criticism erupted soon after Lightfoot unveiled the plan, as aldermen decried the tight time frame for a vote, the duration of the deal and the proposed nonprofit. Mayoral candidate Willie Wilson called it a \"slush fund,\" and it certainly has the potential to turn out that way.Lightfoot would appoint five of the nonprofit's seven directors, giving her control over the entity and influence over which projects it funds. The City Council's only input would be approving the mayor's board appointments. That's not enough to ensure accountability and transparency.LACK OF RELIEFAs an independent, private entity, the nonprofit could escape City Council oversight and public disclosure requirements. Previous mayors have used similar setups to thwart scrutiny by the press and aldermen. Lightfoot's nonprofit would issue annual reports to the public, and one of her aides said it would follow the open-meetings law. Promises, promises.The deal is also notable for what's not in it. Lightfoot has backed off her earlier demand that ComEd stop shutting off power to customers who can't pay their bills. Disconnections are increasing as ComEd raises rates, with a recent report showing cutoffs by the utility rose 27% in the first 10 months of 2022.Most glaring is the lack of real help for Chicagoans struggling under electricity prices inflated by ComEd's bribery scheme and continued rate hikes. In fact, the deal could bump up rates even more, as ComEd seeks regulatory approval to bill customers for the cost of that training center. While ComEd can't legally charge Chicagoans less than other customers, alternative methods of rate relief could have been explored. Perhaps Lightfoot could have pressed ComEd to scale down the $1.5 billion rate hike it's asking state regulators to bless.Still, Lightfoot says she negotiated a great deal for Chicago. If so, she shouldn't fear a long, careful review and tough questions from the City Council.",

If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Text": "After a monumental 2022\u0097the midterm elections, SAFE-T Act controversy, the onset of a brawling mayoral race, living with COVID, et al.\u0097it's hard to imagine that 2023 could top it. Well, buckle your seat belts, folks, because all signs are the new annum will be anything but boring in the world of politics and government.Here are some of the things that will impact your life.In Springfield, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic Party, it's only a question of when lawmakers will move to ban assault weapons and limit gun magazine sizes, make it easier for out-of-state women to come to Illinois for abortions, and probably draft a proposed amendment to the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights.More fascinating, though, is what's been happening on the business side of things, where potential Democratic presidential hopeful J.B. Pritzker lately has been embellishing his pro-business bona fides, for instance moving to pay off the entire deficit in the state's unemployment trust fund.Pritzker has more work to do and knows it, since the state's job growth still is on the low side compared to other states. So keep a very close eye on whether he gets that proposed \"deal closing\" fund of up to $1 billion he wants through a liberal General Assembly, and whether that and other incentives will be enough to get Stellantis to invest a ton in converting its Belvidere plant to produce electric vehicles. This one really, really counts.Nationally, the race for president already has begun\u0097and in fact began even before the midterms. President Joe Biden now seems inclined to run again, but if he changes his mind, a ton of folks with Illinois connections are interested, including Pritzker and a former Chicago business consultant named Pete Buttigieg, now U.S. secretary of transportation.Even more interesting is what's occurring on the Republican side.Donald Trump now is in as much political trouble as he's ever been, beset not only by prosecutors and congressional probes but major figures in his own party who are beginning to say what's been clear for a while: Much as they love him in rural America (including Illinois), he's toxic in the burbs. It's far too early to write Trump off. But if it becomes clear that, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is going to be the GOP nominee, Illinois Republicans finally may have a leader who can help them stanch the bleeding. And pressure on Biden to consider retiring may increase, since Trump likely is the easiest Republican for Biden to beat.Last, but by no means least, you won't have to keep an eye on the struggle for City Hall, because it will bigfoot its way into almost every aspect of life in the metropolitan area. This augurs to be the most significant mayoral election since the Daleys passed the family business to a new generation, with the city's post-COVID economic future very much in the balance.Most of the attention will go to the mayor's race. There, a Lori Lightfoot who has some accomplishments such as increased inner-city investment also has a tendency to make unneeded enemies and is burdened by a crime wave she (and, to be fair, other mayors) just hasn't been able to control. With no giant killer among the field of challengers, Chicago business is uncertain what do. That means anything is possible. How about an April runoff between Willie Wilson and Paul Vallas? Could happen. Or Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia vs. Lightfoot?Equally meaningful are races for the City Council, which has taken a big turn toward the populist left in recent years and soon could go further. A city income tax or a \"LaSalle Street\" tax on financial transactions? Or a much-expanded real estate transfer tax that would hit owners of three-flats and \"rich\" North Side condo owners in the guise of coming up with funds to subsidize development of more affordable housing?Some other hot subjects: Will the Bally's casino glide through or hit bumps with the Illinois Gaming Board? How will local government cope with the end of big federal COVID-relief checks? Will the new downtown NASCAR race be the fiasco some expect?Like I said, quite a year ahead.",

  "Title": "How Willie Wilson built the fortune that fuels his giveaways",
  "Text": "From his 49th-floor penthouse at the St. Regis\u0097not to be confused with the high-rise next door that he departed when his new home blocked his Lake Michigan views\u0097millionaire businessman Willie Wilson keeps tabs on his company and directs his third campaign for mayor.Adorned with newspapers and photos chronicling his life, the apartment mirrors a public image crafted from Wilson's large personality and rise from a Louisiana sharecropper to millionaire who freely hands out cash across the city he overlooks.Even if he fails to make the runoff, the 74-year-old's presence will be felt in the race as his base of support in majority-Black wards makes the math difficult for other candidates relying on votes from Black residents on the South and West sides.With one eye on his phone, Wilson spoke with Crain's about his campaign and revealed he'd recently sold off a stake in his company, Omar Medical Supplies, for the first time.But there are limits to what Wilson will discuss. He won't say if he repeated his 2016 vote for Trump in 2020 and retreats to criticizing other candidates for accepting big-money contributions when pressed on why he won't release his tax returns.Wilson moved to Chicago in 1965, settling in North Lawndale at the tail end of the Great Migration of Black Southerners to Northern cities, which he says made the city \"feel like home.\"In 1970, he began working at McDonald's as a janitor and says his willingness to continue working while his white managers walked out on strike won him his first managerial job. Eventually wanting a store of his own, but without the capital to buy a franchise, he directly appealed to the CEO who turned the burger chain into a household name.\"I went to Ray Kroc at a shareholder meeting,\" he says. \"He gave me the opportunity to get my own store, and then 2 \u00bd years later, I owned five McDonald's.\"His franchises introduced Wilson to the McDonald's supplier ecosystem and sparked the idea to become one himself, selling his restaurants to build a business supplying plastic gloves to the fast-food giant.Wilson named the company after his late son, Omar, who was murdered at age 20 inside Wilson's suburban home in 1995, following what Wilson believes was an argument over drugs.MAKING A CHANGENow living with his second wife, Janette, Wilson says a renewed commitment to his faith pushed him to make a change in his life at the time.\"I wanted to make money so that I could help others,\" he says. \"These things have never been planned by me. It was really just trying to work hard and make a living to help family and others.\"Wilson says West Side Congressman Danny Davis helped him land a contract with Walmart that lifted his business to a higher level. Although Davis made the initial introduction, Wilson says \"you don't get it overnight\" and Walmart vetted his business for years before he landed a contract.Davis recalls Richard Boykin\u0097a former Cook County commissioner\u0097then serving as chief of staff to Davis and currently running Wilson's campaign, drove with Wilson to Arkansas to make the introduction.\"All we did was just indicate that he was trying to do business with them,\" says Davis, who hails from Arkansas. \"His acumen and astuteness and business sense did all the rest.\"Omar Medical sells plastic gloves, garbage can liners and similar products to McDonald's and other retail chains around the world. Wilson himself is not a doctor, but goes by \"Dr. Willie Wilson\"\u0097a reference to the honorary doctorates he's received.A private company, Omar Medical doesn't disclose financial information. The limited publicly available information on Wilson's finances comes from a 2020 report filed during an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate against longtime Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin.Wilson reported $511,579 in income from Omar and $175,000 from Willie Wilson Productions, a separate company that has produced the \"Singsation\" gospel program airing on WGN-TV on Sunday mornings.His disclosure valued Omar at between $25 million and $50 million. He also reported assets, including his Hazel Crest home (he rents his Wacker Drive penthouse), stock options and bank accounts valued between $2.4 million and $5 million.Wilson says he finances his lifestyle with investment returns while \"giving away\" his salary, including high-profile gas and grocery giveaways\u0097which he says he'll continue even if elected mayor\u0097and support for a network of churches.Wilson is the only mayoral candidate who hasn't disclosed at least partial tax returns, telling Crain's, \"I'll show my taxes right now\" if other candidates return contributions from donors who do business with the city.While Wilson says his company does not have any contracts with the city, it was listed as a minority participant, splitting a 30% stake in an up to $30 million contract from the city's sister agency, Chicago Public Schools, awarded to Office Depot.Wilson told Crain's in December he didn't believe he'd need to divest himself of his company or put his assets in a blind trust if he were elected mayor, but Boykin later said Wilson had decided he would sell off his stake in Omar Medical \"so there is no potential or direct conflict of interest with the city or its sister agencies.\"Wilson would not divest himself from his production company because he believes there would be no conflicts, Boykin said.Whatever Omar's revenue stream might be, Wilson now owns just 51% of it after selling a minority stake to longtime company President Andre Fair and a pair of local businessmen with their own ties to McDonald's supply chain. Wilson declined to name the other investors, but according to a filing with the Illinois secretary of state, William Weimer and Matthew Cook are listed as managers along with Wilson and Fair.Weimer is the former chief financial officer of Naperville-based OSI Group, a major McDonald's meat supplier, and Cook was CEO of LBP Manufacturing, a packaging supplier. Fair confirmed he was an investor. Cook and Weimer did not return requests for comment.Wilson won't say how much he received for the minority stake. He insists the sale was not needed to finance another run for mayor, saying, \"If I didn't have my own money I wouldn't be in this game.\"His wealth has not only funded his own campaigns\u0097including $6 million this cycle\u0097but is directed to elected officials where he hopes to pick up votes.Since 2019, Wilson has contributed heavily to conservative aldermen in Chicago, including $11,000 to Ald. Ray Lopez, 15th; $9,000 to Ald. Jim Gardiner, 45th; $5,500 to Ald. Nick Sposato, 38th; and $2,000 to Ald. Anthony Napolitano, 41st.BRANCHING OUTAs one of seven Black candidates, Wilson will be hard-pressed to make the runoff only by winning majority-Black wards.\"He clearly knows that he needs to go beyond his comfort zone, beyond his base, and he's been actively doing that,\" says Lopez, who ended his own candidacy for mayor in November and endorsed Wilson last month.Recent polls from opposing campaigns show Wilson third or fourth in the nine-way race, with a poll from incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot pegging his support at 11%, matching Wilson's share of the vote in both 2015 and 2019.Wilson is a frequent guest at political events on the Northwest Side, and Sposato says Wilson's \"batshit crazy generosity\"\u0097the millions in gas and groceries he's given away since last year, including from a heavy cluster of stores on the Northwest Side\u0097raised his profile in the area.\"Every time he comes, everybody wants to take a picture, everybody wants to shake his hand and everybody asks me, 'Is Willie coming, is Willie coming?' And I go, 'He always comes\u0097I don't invite him, but somehow, someway, he finds out,' \" Sposato says. A Lightfoot ally, Sposato says he won't endorse a mayoral candidate before the runoff.At events, Wilson is as likely to offer a prayer as he is to launch into a stump speech. When he talks policy, he sticks to simple promises of not raising taxes and taking \"the handcuffs off the police and putting them on the criminals.\"During a recent mayoral debate, Wilson sparked controversy with his criticism of new limits on police pursuits of fleeing suspects, arguing officers should be allowed to \"hunt them down like a rabbit.\"In seeking support from conservative voters, Wilson could open himself up to attack in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, says former Ald. Michael Scott Jr., 24th. Scott has not endorsed a candidate but was an ally of Lightfoot on the City Council and was appointed by the mayor to the Chicago Board of Education. He predicts Lightfoot and others would soon hit Wilson for his past support for Trump. Lightfoot in particular needs to peel away Black voters from Wilson if she hopes to win.Despite his decades-old friendship with Wilson, Davis has endorsed Lightfoot after backing Wilson in 2015 and 2019, saying he made a political calculation to back the city's incumbent Black mayor who has invested in the South and West sides.Wilson says he doesn't regret the millions he's spent on his campaigns\u0097even if he comes up short again.\"Let people judge me for what you see me doing,\" he says. \"If that don't do it, it just ain't that important.\"",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "Is the CTA finally taking security seriously?",
  "Text": "I saw something when I got on the el the other day that I hadn't seen in, well, probably a year and a half. That was two Chicago police officers\u0097not unarmed and barely awake \"security\" personnel, mind you, but actual cops.Is it the first robin of spring? Or at least a recognition by City Hall and the Chicago Transit Authority that they've got a first-class security problem on their hands as mayoral election season approaches? I certainly hope so.I first wrote about this situation way back in March 2021. At that time, police and the CTA said they were doing their best, and predicted improvement with more time, especially as largely self-policing crowds of commuters returned to work. Since then, the commuters have returned, sort of, with CTA ridership up to about half of what it was pre-pandemic. Police have added more staffers, the CTA has hired security guards and things are somewhat improved.But not enough. Just this last week, the Chicago Tribune reported police would be boosting their presence on the CTA, even pulling some people off desk duty, after a 29-year-old man was shot to death on the Red Line. A few days earlier, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that, even though ridership is still down by almost half, the number of violent crimes on CTA vehicles through July 19 is the highest it's been since 2011, and the second highest in two decades.Given all that, CTA President Dorval Carter is trying again.In a presentation at the City Club of Chicago, he rejected a proposal from mayoral hopeful Willie Wilson to reform the CTA's own police unit, saying it would take two years to do so and that the CTA would face the same challenges hiring qualified staff that the Chicago Police Department does. But he laid out a series of other initiatives, including adding K-9 units, adding higher fare gates to el stations to keep fare jumpers and other troublemakers from entering, and spiffing up the look of dozens of stations so they don't appear quite so forlorn.Carter even unveiled a new initiative about how to cope with sometimes dozens of homeless people, some of them with addiction problems, who occupy trains, especially in cold-weather months. Trying to walk a fine line between protecting his customers and extending a hand to those in need, Carter said the CTA this winter will be partnering with social-service agencies who will \"engage\" homeless people on the system. Carter said he's \"not talking about\" throwing people off the trains wholesale, as they're doing in New York City. \"I'm talking about getting people who really need help, help.\"I hope it works. Just like I hope Carter's parallel plan to adjust CTA schedules to reality works, too. Instead of sticking to a pre-pandemic schedule the agency clearly cannot meet because of a shortage of workers, it instead will release schedules that may appear stretched out but actually are achievable.\"The pandemic changed everything,\" Carter summarized. \"There's no road map on how to maneuver a pandemic.\"On balance, it looks likes the gravity of the situation finally has sunk in\u0097at CTA headquarters and, more important, in Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office, which has had a bad case of rose-colored glassism on this subject.Chicago's economy, particularly the downtown economy, will not recover without a transit system that works and that people are unafraid to use. I've seen stuff on the CTA in the last year I thought I'd never see. I don't know how many friends and associates and co-workers I know who biked to work, or took three buses, because they're afraid to get on the train.The clock is ticking on this one. With huge federal COVID-relief aid that's been supporting CTA operations starting to phase out after next year, the CTA only has so long to get its house in order and lure back riders. I wish Carter luck. I fear he'll need it.",

  "Title": "City Council gets it right",
  "Text": "Kudos to Chicago aldermen for refusing to fast-track Mayor Lori Lightfoot's proposed franchise extension for electric utility Commonwealth Edison.If Chicago history teaches anything, it's that massive, multiyear municipal contracts involving hundreds of millions of dollars shouldn't be rushed through the City Council to meet artificial deadlines. Although the parallel isn't exact, Lightfoot's push for a quick council vote on the ComEd extension triggers unhappy memories of predecessor Richard M. Daley's infamous 75-year parking meter lease.Council members caved to Daley's demand for fast signoff on that deal, now widely recognized as a multibillion-dollar giveaway to Wall Street. Thankfully, aldermen are resisting mayoral pressure to quickly approve a 15-year extension of ComEd's lucrative franchise. After Lightfoot introduced her proposal on Feb. 1, they sidelined it in the Rules Committee and declined to schedule a special meeting to consider it the following week.A commitment of such magnitude, complexity and duration needs thorough and unhurried scrutiny, not a rushed review ahead of this month's municipal elections, which could usher in a new mayor and flip many council seats.Aldermen are raising important questions, such as the wisdom of awarding such a long electricity franchise at a time of great change and uncertainty in energy markets. They also wonder why the city should enter a long-term partnership with a company that admitted bribing state lawmakers to pass legislation that cost customers hundreds of millions in rate increases. On that score, some note that pending trials of company executives could shed more light on ComEd's shady dealings and their impact on customers. Others want more consumer protections.CRITICISMLightfoot's proposed deal goes far beyond a straightforward renewal of ComEd's franchise agreement, which expired two years ago. ComEd would pay Chicago an annual franchise fee of $90 million to $100 million and pass the cost along to customers.The proposal also envisions a smorgasbord of clean energy and workforce development initiatives purportedly worth more than $500 million. ComEd would fund many of them by contributing up to $120 million to a new nonprofit that would dole out the cash to projects deemed worthy.ComEd also promises to build a $32.5 million job-training center on the West Side to train 10,000 people for clean energy jobs, and to hire 1,000 construction and customer service workers from the South and West sides. On top of that, the utility and the city agree to seek $400 million in outside funding for other investments, including 4,000 solar panels for low-income residents, solar energy workshops and affordable broadband service on ComEd dark fiber.Criticism erupted soon after Lightfoot unveiled the plan, as aldermen decried the tight time frame for a vote, the duration of the deal and the proposed nonprofit. Mayoral candidate Willie Wilson called it a \"slush fund,\" and it certainly has the potential to turn out that way.Lightfoot would appoint five of the nonprofit's seven directors, giving her control over the entity and influence over which projects it funds. The City Council's only input would be approving the mayor's board appointments. That's not enough to ensure accountability and transparency.LACK OF RELIEFAs an independent, private entity, the nonprofit could escape City Council oversight and public disclosure requirements. Previous mayors have used similar setups to thwart scrutiny by the press and aldermen. Lightfoot's nonprofit would issue annual reports to the public, and one of her aides said it would follow the open-meetings law. Promises, promises.The deal is also notable for what's not in it. Lightfoot has backed off her earlier demand that ComEd stop shutting off power to customers who can't pay their bills. Disconnections are increasing as ComEd raises rates, with a recent report showing cutoffs by the utility rose 27% in the first 10 months of 2022.Most glaring is the lack of real help for Chicagoans struggling under electricity prices inflated by ComEd's bribery scheme and continued rate hikes. In fact, the deal could bump up rates even more, as ComEd seeks regulatory approval to bill customers for the cost of that training center. While ComEd can't legally charge Chicagoans less than other customers, alternative methods of rate relief could have been explored. Perhaps Lightfoot could have pressed ComEd to scale down the $1.5 billion rate hike it's asking state regulators to bless.Still, Lightfoot says she negotiated a great deal for Chicago. If so, she shouldn't fear a long, careful review and tough questions from the City Council.",

  "Title": "Where we are as a murky casino process closes",
  "Text": "Fools' taxes are nothing new. Lottery ticket sales have been a major source of state revenue for decades. And though this page has always taken a dim view of funding government by leveraging people's willingness to throw away their money at a local casino, that ship has sailed, so to speak\u0097or at least it's about to leave the dock. Chicago is set to get a casino, like it or not. The challenge now is figuring out which of the three finalists in the running for the license is the best one for the job.Actually, \"best\" is probably the wrong word to use in this context. Let's say \"least bad,\" because we are now in the late stages of a casino development process that's been problematic from the start: Crain's first raised doubts way back in 2019 that onerous taxes built into the casino law could make a Chicago casino unattractive to top-flight operators. Nevertheless, enough bidders eventually stepped forward to pitch for the license, and the process lumbered ahead. Now Chicagoans have three plans to consider. All three have their individual flaws.Having witnessed three separate town hall-style presentations\u0097each of which was long on salesmanship and short on actual community input\u0097we now know what the bidders want us to know about each of the proposals: Hard Rock's vision for the One Central development near Soldier Field; Bally's idea to transform the Tribune plant property at Chicago and Halsted; and Rush Street Gaming's offer to build on Related Midwest's neighborhood-in-the-making, The 78.And yet, beyond the glossy brochures and manicured PowerPoint presentations on display at public hearings and community events, inconvenient details of the less-than-transparent bidding process and the doings of some of the bidders themselves have managed to come out into the open, largely through the work of Crain's political columnist Greg Hinz. As he reports in this week's issue, there are now serious questions about whether a key city consultant on City Hall's casino effort had a conflict of interest and why the Lightfoot administration didn't disclose that reality to aldermen.That revelation follows Crain's April 20 report that Bally's received some special treatment from the Lightfoot administration: an undisclosed two-for-one deal that saved it $300,000. Five different groups submitted bids, but only four paid a required $300,000 application fee. Bally's was involved in two of those bids but only paid one application fee. Earlier still, the city let Bally's, in low-key fashion, drop a clause in its contract with minority investors giving the company the unilateral right to buy out the minorities at a predetermined price.On April 11, meanwhile, Crain's revealed that even though one of the rejected proposals\u0097from the Rivers Casino group, seeking to build at McCormick Place's Lakeside Center\u0097was jettisoned on grounds that the aging facility was needed for convention business, McCormick Place is now preparing to seek its own bidders to repurpose the very same Lakeside Center for \"entertainment\" or other use.And then there was the news, revealed by Crain's on April 26, that the Lightfoot administration is upping the ante for the three finalists, asking them to agree to pay tens of millions of dollars upfront to the city if they win the prized gambling rights. Sources say the mayor is seeking $40 million now plus $2 million a year down the road\u0097or a total of $75 million if all the money is paid now. Some see it as a late-stage stickup; others see it as a proper effort to wring maximum cash out of a lucrative asset, which perhaps it is\u0097as long as it doesn't prompt bidders to walk away altogether.So it's fair to say the bidding process has taken some strange twists and turns. But then there are more practical matters to consider. All three site proposals would create major traffic challenges and transform the surrounding areas in ways that neighbors have made clear they do not like. In fact, as Ald. Brendan Reilly pointed out on a recent episode of Crain's A.D. Q&amp;A podcast, each of these plans has sparked so much opposition that getting any one of them through the City Council for approval will be an uphill battle.Setting aside the behind-the-scenes drama regarding its application fees, its treatment of minority investors and more, the Bally's plan is particularly problematic as a neighborhood development, existing as it would within a slice of the city that's already congested and lacking convenient access to train and highway connections.Similarly, the Hard Rock proposal near Soldier Field has weathered NIMBY pushback and opposition from the local alderman. Hard Rock's team\u0097a joint venture between the majority owners, the Seminole Tribe of Florida and a collection of investors that includes Bob Dunn's Landmark Development and Black-owned Loop Capital\u0097hopes to convince the city that it can move forward with the casino even if the $6.5 billion in state assistance needed for the larger, controversial One Central development doesn't materialize. Pardon the pun, but that seems like a gamble the city shouldn't take.Which leaves The 78 as perhaps the least objectionable of a trio of less-than-stellar options. Yes, traffic will be an issue at this site, which skirts the Chicago River just south of the Loop. But this is a neighborhood largely being built from scratch, so the NIMBY concerns, while not entirely invalid, are less dire than in the River North area near Bally's site. Another plus of The 78, which Hard Rock can't tout: It's away from the lakefront, reducing fears of souring our park-like shoreline with an Atlantic City-style facade. It's not ideal, but it's as close as Chicago is likely to get under the circumstances.",

  "Title": "Will city effectively ban natural gas in new buildings?",
  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot is set to back an ordinance that would clamp down on carbon emissions from newly constructed buildings in Chicago, forcing most if not all new construction to fuel heat and cooking with electricity rather than natural gas.The measure is expected to be introduced Feb. 1 when the City Council next meets, according to sources familiar with the proposal.The ordinance would mark a critical first step in shifting away from carbon-emitting natural gas, for decades the principal way Chicagoans have stayed warm during the winter.It would echo a similar statute signed into law a little over a year ago in New York City by then-Mayor Bill de Blasio. Cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco have taken matters further and outright banned gas in new buildings as America's largest cities attempt to do their part in response to climate change.The mayor's office declined to comment on the ordinance. But in a statement, a Lightfoot spokeswoman said, \"Mayor Lightfoot has made it clear that she's committed to working with the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition and stakeholders across all sectors to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions to meet the city's Climate Action Plan goals while delivering health, climate and economic benefits to Chicagoans. The mayor continues to work collaboratively on this issue, notably having launched the Chicago Building Decarbonization Working Group in 2021 who studied building decarbonization extensively. Mayor Lightfoot is focused on creating bold policy that supports a clean energy future and healthy and efficient buildings for all.\"The anticipated ordinance echoes a key recommendation in the report issued late last year by that working group, which was to quickly phase out gas in new buildings and structures being extensively renovated.The measure will set limits on carbon emissions rather than imposing a gas ban, potentially allowing for carbon-free alternatives to electricity like hydrogen and fuel from gas released from landfills and other waste sites converted into usable fuel, sources say. In practical terms, though, electricity\u0097at least for now\u0097will be more cost-efficient than those emerging energy sources.There also will be exemptions for commercial cooking establishments, crematoriums and other gas-dependent businesses.The mayor's office is in the process of briefing affected interests and aldermen, sources said.SUPPORT AND OPPOSITIONEnvironmental groups are in strong support, as are some consumer groups like the Citizens Utility Board.It remains to be seen how groups representing builders, developers and building owners will react. The fact that the ordinance applies to new construction and not existing buildings is likely to mute some opposition.In opposition is Peoples Gas, the natural gas utility for the city of Chicago.\"Proponents of natural gas bans regularly claim that electric heat pumps may help keep Chicago warm in the future. That simply isn't true. Not only do they struggle to work in cold climates, but it costs up to $60,000 to convert a single home to an electric heat pump,\" Peoples said in a statement on the proposal. \"The fact that the proposed ordinance includes exceptions for hospitals and health care facilities should raise alarms as it shows supporters of this proposed ban on natural gas are fully aware the alternatives to natural gas are not safe and reliable enough for the most vulnerable Chicagoans.\"Peoples also emphasized that fossil fuels currently are burned to produce electricity for the region. Adding demand for electricity could mean more natural gas consumption\u0097but by power plants instead of buildings.The Climate &amp; Equitable Jobs Act, enacted in 2021, requires the phaseout of gas and coal to produce electricity in Illinois by 2045.Peoples is in the midst of a controversial, multibillion-dollar revamp of its underground piping system serving the city. That project, behind budget and mired in cost overruns for several years, has significantly increased heating costs for Chicagoans. Peoples has a record-setting $402 million rate-hike request before the Illinois Commerce Commission that could exacerbate the affordability problem.Critics have said an extensive upgrade of the entire system, meant to last for 50 years or more, is foolhardy when the city wants to move away from gas over the next few decades.A wild card will be whether Local 150 of the International Union of Operating Engineers, whose members have benefited from the massive Peoples project, will join Peoples in opposition. Local 150 is politically potent and has played a key role in stymieing efforts in Springfield to rein in Peoples' infrastructure spending and associated rate hikes.",

  "Text": "Gerardo GarciaAge: 39Deputy commissioner, Chicago Department of Planning &amp; DevelopmentGrowing up in Little Village, the son of a small-business owner and a school aide, Gerardo Garcia developed an acute sense of inequity in the built environment.\"In this awesome community I lived in, the great commercial corridor was 26th Street,\" Garcia says, harking back to the theme he chose for his college entrance essay. Measured by retail sales, \"it was second only to Michigan Avenue, but it didn't look like Michigan Avenue.\"As deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Planning &amp; Development, Garcia has a big role in correcting the inequity. He's leading the department's work on Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Invest South/West initiative, a dedicated effort to direct new funding, programs and architecture to the most divested parts of Chicago. Garcia heads a team of 20 planners in the effort.\"As a child of Little Village, all Gerardo ever wanted to do was use his talents to lift it up,\" said Maurice Cox, commissioner of planning and development, \"and in walks Mayor Lightfoot's Invest South/West to give him the way to do that.\"Garcia has been at City Hall for 11 years, long before Invest South/West rolled out in 2019. He was also instrumental in developing the West Loop Design Guidelines that were meant to keep the booming neighborhood from looking like suburban sprawl gone vertical. \"Open space, access to daylight, widened sidewalks,\" Garcia says, \"they're amenities for the community that can be lost with rapid development. We saw an opportunity to use design to contribute to a healthy and positive public realm.\"Garcia was also instrumental in the city's effort to landmark a 1.5-square-mile swath of Pilsen as a bulwark against gentrification, a proposal the city later dropped when it met with widespread backlash.In 2021, Garcia recruited many of the 24 members of the city's new Committee on Design, where architects (such as Jeanne Gang) and other industry figures (such as Theaster Gates) provide peer review of development proposals. \"Every major city we researched had some sort of peer review process,\" Garcia says. \"Chicago didn't, and I can't explain why. If we want to have world-class designs in the city, we need to have peer review.\"",

  "Title": "Grit vs. glitz: River West braces for a casino",
  "Text": "Speaking over the sound of diesel truck engines as the scent of freshly mixed asphalt rises from a half-dozen silos behind her, Anne Wilson points out the changing scenery in the blocks surrounding her paving business at Ogden Avenue and the Chicago River.There's the 363-unit Spoke luxury apartment complex that opened in 2018 two blocks away, right next to a new 40,000-square-foot grocery store that debuted late last year. Two more luxury apartment buildings\u0097including one rising 23 stories and towering above the surrounding neighborhood\u0097opened across Milwaukee Avenue in 2020.When Wilson bought her riverfront asphalt plant in 1997, \u0093I didn\u0092t imagine the encroachment we have now,\u0094 says the president of Bigane Paving, lamenting complaints from nearby residents about asphalt odors and dust, as well as trucks rolling in and out of the property before 5 a.m. \u0093But it\u0092s 25 years later. Things change.\u0094Yet for Bigane and the handful of other industrial businesses that have called River West home for decades, the most significant change is still ahead: Bigane\u0092s plant stands less than 1,000 feet from the 30-acre site where Bally\u0092s plans to build a 1 million-square-foot casino and hotel complex, potentially a self-sustaining entertainment district drawing millions of annual visitors and an onslaught of traffic to a historically quiet stretch of the Chicago River. Even closer is concrete supplier Prairie Material, which brings raw material to its massive plant by barge, just 1,500 linear feet of riverfront away from where Bally\u0092s envisions patrons arriving to its gambling playground by boat.The gritty operations represent one of the last bastions of the industrial past along the North Branch of the Chicago River, a pocket long dominated by construction and manufacturing-focused businesses but gradually giving way to the city\u0092s postindustrial future. Several such companies have left after selling land to residential and commercial developers, while others have watched real estate investors close in since former Mayor Rahm Emanuel opened up the North Branch Industrial Corridor to new uses in 2017. Now the casino and other developments likely to follow stand to turbocharge that movement, resurfacing a big question for city officials over whether dirty\u0097yet essential\u0097industrial businesses have a place on the increasingly affluent North Side of town.COEXISTENCEMayor Lori Lightfoot, who chose the Chicago Tribune riverfront printing plant site for the casino, needs the tax dollars Bally\u0092s will generate. But she must also ensure that silos, slot machines and a surge of new residents and visitors to the area can coexist in harmony if she wants to maintain hundreds of blue-collar jobs close to the city\u0092s core and avoid a public battle like the one that played out for years farther up the river between North Side residents and scrap metal recycler General Iron Industries.\u0093I\u0092m not afraid of the casino as long as (Bally\u0092s and city officials) realize we have to play in the sandbox together,\u0094 says John Bosca, a former head of the Neighbors of River West community group and a member of an advisory group Lightfoot recently convened to weigh in on the casino project. \u0093If we can\u0092t play nice in the sandbox, then nobody wins.\u0094The $1.7 billion proposed casino and hotel development, which still needs approval from the Chicago Plan Commission and the Illinois Gaming Board, is the biggest of several major changes coming to River West. Canadian developer Onni Group has a deal to buy the property immediately north of the casino site and could build more than 1,000 residential units there, just across the river from the 2,700 units it has proposed on the southern tip of Goose Island.Closer to the Ohio Street feeder ramp that borders the neighborhood\u0092s southern edge, Chicago developer Jeff Shapack\u00a0and Magnetar Capital founder Alec Litowitz have\u00a0proposed around 1,400 apartments and a hotel. Shapack, best known for helping coin the \u0093Fulton Market District\u0094 brand as a subsection of the West Loop and leading major development projects there, dubs his collection of River West projects as \u0093NoMa\u0094 (North of Market) to add cachet. One of his fellow Fulton Market staples is even following him there: A venture of Girl &amp; The Goat parent Boka Restaurant Group recently bought Emmit\u0092s Irish Pub, a well-known watering hole for the past quarter-century at the intersection of Milwaukee and Grand avenues.Those investors and developers prize their River West locations. But so do businesses like Bigane. Proximity matters for a company that provides asphalt\u0097a perishable product\u0097to a litany of projects downtown, including the ongoing repaving of North Michigan Avenue. Prairie Material, which did not respond to requests for comment, deploys a fleet of concrete trucks daily to downtown construction sites.More residential density combined with nightly casino visitors could wreak havoc on traffic in an area that already grapples with congestion, says Steve Kersten, president of WaterSaver Faucet. The company has manufactured fixtures for life science research labs at its plant on the 700 block of West Erie Street since 1972, when it was \u0093very much an industrial neighborhood,\u0094 he says. His property is directly across the street from Bally\u0092s proposed campus on a stretch of Erie that is slated to become a major access point for casino vehicle traffic.A combination of the casino and new development coming to River West \u0093will make moving around here very difficult,\u0094 says Kersten, adding that Bally\u0092s and city officials he has met with have told him there are plans in place to alleviate the issue. \u0093I just don\u0092t know what those plans are,\u0094 he says.MEETINGSChristopher Jewett, vice president of corporate development for Bally\u0092s, said in a statement that the company has had more than 50 meetings with community and business groups, including River West\u0092s longtime industrial operators. Jewett said Bally\u0092s has committed about $75 million for infrastructure improvements in the area and plans to implement mitigation recommendations from a traffic study completed last year.\u0093We expect Bally\u0092s Chicago will positively impact the neighborhood and existing and future residents, and part of that is making sure we are responsive to community needs now and into the future,\u0094 the statement said.A Lightfoot spokeswoman said in a statement that a \u0093casino-based entertainment complex is an entirely appropriate project\u0094 for the area and noted city officials have met and will continue to meet regularly with local businesses during the casino\u0092s construction.As for resolving potential conflicts, Lightfoot will rely on land use guidelines laid out in the 2017 North Branch plan and the city\u0092s power to approve or block new developments, the statement said.It\u0092s far from the first time the city has dealt with a neighborhood transitioning from its industrial past. Emanuel looked to reshape several factory-laden corridors to help boost the city\u0092s tax base, most notably in the Fulton Market District. After the city allowed more density in that neighborhood, many old-line meatpackers and food wholesalers cashed out with big checks in hand from developers looking to transform their properties.DRAMAThe North Branch of the Chicago River has seen more drama. After years of fighting with the city over environmental violations, General Iron was forced to shutter its riverfront plant in 2020 and built a new facility on the Southeast Side. But that saga showed the perils of forced relocations: The city denied the company a new operating permit earlier this year as Southeast Side residents pushed back against becoming a landing spot for such a gritty business.Wilson, a native South Sider and fourth-generation owner of Bigane, says she hasn\u0092t received any offers for her 6.5-acre site and stresses she has no intention of leaving River West. But if a proposal came along that was too good to pass up, she would shutter the business entirely rather than try to build a new plant that residents somewhere else might not want. \u0093Who wants to go through that?\u0094 she says.For now, she\u0092s hoping the Bally\u0092s investments will help fund long overdue infrastructure upgrades in the neighborhood, and that current and future mayors will protect companies like hers as River West evolves.\u0093We have 75 to 100 people that work here. These are good jobs. You can support a family on these wages,\u0094 Wilson says. \u0093Those are things I think we want to encourage the city to keep.\u0094",

  "Title": "An affordable housing project everybody wants is stalled because of a dispute over parking",
  "Text": "In Lincoln Square, a proposal that residents and the local alderman believe is a textbook example of how to add affordable housing to an affluent neighborhood is hung up on City Hall's opposition to its parking plan.\"The overarching goal here is to add affordable housing to a neighborhood that has been bleeding affordable units,\" said Ald. Matt Martin, 47th.\"We can get to that,\" Martin said, if the parking snarl can be resolved.On a 43-space surface parking lot at 4715 N. Western Ave. that is now owned by the city, a developer proposes to build a five-story building with commercial space on the first floor, public parking on the second and 51 units of designated affordable housing on the upper three. The apartments would be studios and one- and two-bedrooms priced to meet the city's standards for affordable housing, at a maximum of about $75,000 household income.The stack of three uses \"is a way to support affordable housing and support one of the hallmark local business districts in the city,\" said Teresa Fourcher, a 15-year Lincoln Square resident and urban planner. The Lincoln Avenue strip just east of the parking lot has a thriving mix of restaurants, entertainment venues and retailers, some of whose customers park in the lot.The combination of uses in the proposed building \"is a solution that works for everyone in the community,\" Fourcher said.The existing parking lot has an entrance from Western Avenue, and as proposed by developer The Community Builders, the new building would as well, with 41 parking spaces on the second floor. In December, the proposal was one of 24 that the city Department of Housing included in a billion-dollar package of affordable housing projects that would receive low-income housing tax credits as a tool for funding their construction.STICKING POINTSince then, Martin and others said, the city's housing and planning departments have stipulated that Community Builders must revise its plan, in part pushing the parking entrance off Western and onto an alley on the opposite side of the lot, stretching north from Leland Avenue. They have also stated concern about providing low-income housing tax credits to fund a parking lot.Will Woodley, a Chicago-based regional vice president at The Community Builders, a nationwide firm, did not respond to a request for comment.The city's departments of housing and planning emailed Crain's a prepared statement that said Chicago's \"Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy calls for development near transit to maximize density, maximize affordability and minimize parking. An example which embodies these principles in action is the Emmett Street development in Logan Square, which officially opens later this month with 100 affordable housing units on a former city-owned parking lot next to the Logan Square Blue line stop. Zero public parking spots were replaced.\"The Western Avenue proposal would replace the surface spaces with roughly the same number, on the building's second floor. From the statement, this appears to be City Hall's sticking point on the proposal.Martin and residents said City Hall is taking a rigid position, declining to compromise in order to meet the specific needs of the site.The desire to reduce or eliminate parking on the site \"is not codified as policy,\" Martin said. \"It's a preference. I get that, but we need to look at the existing situation and see what fits.\"Foucher said City Hall is \"making us choose between supporting affordable housing and supporting local businesses,\" some of whose customers rely on the parking lot at Western and Leland avenues.Moving the parking entrance off Western would eliminate the driveway, or curb cut, on a stretch of the road that is a designated P-Street, or pedestrian-friendly street.\"Let's not let a curb cut stop affordable housing from getting built,\" Martin said. He said the cost of redesigning the building and engineering a cantilevered section over the alley \"would be better spent on adding more affordable units to this project.\"FRUSTRATIONFive civic groups from the surrounding neighborhoods sent a letter last week to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, city Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara, city Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox and Martin requesting that they fast-track approval of the project with its existing Western Avenue curb cut and with a sixth floor added, for a total of four affordable housing floors, about 70 units.Several Lincoln Square residents said they feel frustrated by the impasse, given that the concept of putting affordable housing on the old parking lot is something virtually everyone agrees on.\"We absolutely need affordable housing in Lincoln Square,\" said Heather Smith, an urban planner and adjunct in the geography department at DePaul University who has lived in the neighborhood since 2013. \"This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to turn city-owned land in an affluent neighborhood. It should be full steam ahead.\"The Community Builders first proposed to build on the parking site in spring 2020.Foucher said \"the vast majority of people in Lincoln Square would like to see this (development) happen.\" She said she and others are acutely aware that many middle-income people can't afford to live in popular Lincoln Square, where the median sale price of a house was $836,500 in 2021, according to the Chicago Association of Realtors, and the median price of a condo was $325,000. Teardowns of smaller houses and conversions of two-flats into single-family homes have reduced the naturally occuring affordable housing in the neighborhood.The parking lot site is half a block from the CTA's Western Avenue Brown Line station and close to bus lines on Western and Lawrence avenues, making it a transit-oriented site.On top of that, \"you can walk to five grocery stores from there,\" Foucher said.\"We don't understand the delay when the community, the alderman and the local businesses are all speaking with one voice,\" said Adam Kingsley, an attorney and 20-year resident who chairs the planning and zoning committee of Heart of Lincoln Square Neighbors Association.\"This is not a situation where the neighbors don't want affordable housing coming in,\" Kingsley said. \"We want it, but it isn't happening.\"",

  "Text": "The consumer price index for the Chicago area rose 9.4% in June from a year earlier, its biggest jump since September 1981, when Jane Byrne was mayor of Chicago and \u0093Endless Love\u0094 by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie was the most popular song in America.But inflation evokes more stress than nostalgia today. Prices on apartments, gasoline, jet fuel, concrete and steak all have risen, and the tight job market is pushing up the cost of labor, a key business input.Businesses are paying their suppliers a lot more than they used to as well. The U.S. producer price index, which measures prices at the wholesale level, rose 11.3% in the 12 months through June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau does not compile an index at the metro level.Labor costs in the Chicago area have risen since the pandemic. Total compensation for private-industry workers in the Chicago area was up 3.9% in March from a year earlier, compared with a 3.2% gain in March 2020, according to BLS. But compensation was up much more in places like Seattle, at 7.8%, and Boston, 5.6%.Still, when it comes to the consumer price index, the Chicago area, at 9.4% in June, doesn't compare favorably to the nation, which came in at 9.1% for the month.Other data offers early signs that inflation may be cooling. Prices for gasoline and commodities including oil, corn, copper and lumber have been falling recently, pulling back after big jumps.Of course, what the future holds will depend heavily on the Federal Reserve as it raises short-term interest rates to tame inflation. And the Fed's recent rate hikes have given businesses and consumers something else to worry about: a potential recession.Whatever's on the horizon, inflation is here today, and here's how it's affecting key Chicago industries:AIRLINESPlanes are full and fares are soaring into summer, the busiest time of year for air travel.The number of people passing through security checkpoints at the nation's airports is edging ever closer to pre-pandemic levels, and airlines are struggling to keep up. The average price of a ticket sold by travel agents has soared 37% this year to $628, a seven-year high, according to Airlines Reporting Corp.Just as inflation can giveth, inflation can taketh away. The same thing driving up airfares\u0097higher fuel prices\u0097also squeezes consumers' budgets, making them less likely to spring for a vacation. Inflation also is driving up airlines' biggest cost: labor. United offered its pilots a 14.75% raise over two years. American is offering its pilots 16.9%.\"Higher fuel prices means they have to crank up fares, and that's going to hurt demand,\" says George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The consumer is going to pay up for summer. Once we get past that, and the extreme desire to get out and take a vacation, we think some of that (travel) demand is at risk once you get past Labor Day.\"One reason to be concerned even before then: Consumer sentiment is at its lowest point in 70 years, according to a University of Michigan index. If the consumer pulls back, it threatens the goals of United and other big airlines, which have forecast a return to profitability this summer.United CEO Scott Kirby is betting against it, telling investors recently that prices are still below historical levels and that spending on air travel isn't as volatile nor as correlated to the broader economy as most people think.Wall Street is watching what happens later this year.\"The test is: Will the companies let people travel, and will consumers keep traveling at Thanksgiving and Christmas?\" Ferguson says.\u0097John PletzHEALTH CARELocal hospitals are in a tight spot.They're being squeezed as the costs of labor, crucial supplies and pharmaceuticals rise, but long-term pricing agreements with insurance companies limit them from immediately increasing the cost of care for most patients, a phenomenon shrinking hospital margins by the week.\"The challenge is the mismatch between the costs that we see rising relative to commercially insured health care rates,\" says Ivan Samstein, executive vice president and chief financial officer at the University of Chicago Medicine. \"This isn't by any means unique to UChicago Medicine.\"Typical hospital and insurance pricing agreements tend to last two to four years, he explains.A recent report from Chicago health care consultancy Kaufman, Hall &amp; Associates shows that across 900 U.S. hospitals and health systems, expenses are up nearly 11% in May compared to the year before.At Rockford-based Mercyhealth and Chicago's Sinai Chicago, rising supply and shipping costs are growing. But increasing labor costs, compounded by a widespread health care worker shortage, is the No. 1 burden, they say.\"The single most central impact that we've seen on the price increases has been in our staffing and labor contracts,\" says Sinai Chicago Chief Operating Officer Dr. Airica Steed.For local medical device and pharmaceutical companies\u0097including Baxter International, AbbVie and Abbott\u0097the rising costs of manufacturing, distribution, labor and supplies are taking a toll on their bottom lines, says Harry Kraemer, a professor at Northwestern University and former Baxter CEO.One particularly pricey material is plastic. It's typically made from raw materials like natural gas and oil, which have jumped in price.\"The major component in most medical products is plastic, and that's all petroleum-based,\" Kraemer says.\u0097Katherine DavisAUTO INSURANCEFew industries have been whipsawed more dramatically than the auto insurance business.Companies like Bloomington-based State Farm and Northbrook-based Allstate veered from swimming in cash in 2020 and early 2021 due to the COVID-caused disappearance of rush hour to losing money insuring cars beginning in late 2021 and continuing into this year.Drivers returned to the roads in the middle of last year. With used-car prices soaring, the cost to insurers of replacing a totaled car increased along with them.Geico, best known for its ubiquitous TV ads extolling how much it can save consumers on car insurance, next month is raising rates in Illinois for most long-term customers by 17% and for newer policyholders by 34%\u0097the steepest such increase in recent memory here by any major auto carrier.Other companies are hiking rates, often in the high single digits, more than once a year in order to catch up with costs. The inflated prices just raise the cost of driving, which already is well up due to the steep rise in gasoline prices.The rate hikes also have attracted the ire of insurance regulators in many states, including Illinois, who question why drivers continued to pay relatively high amounts for insurance while they were sheltering at home and now are seeing their rates soar with the resumption of relatively normal driving. The Illinois Department of Insurance recently released data showing the fat profits many of the largest insurers here earned in 2020 and early 2021 with the aim of putting pressure on companies to share more of that windfall with their policyholders.\u0097Steve DanielsUTILITIESConsumers also are feeling the heat from rising energy costs. With natural gas prices up after more than a decade of unusually low costs, electric and natural gas utilities continue to bank on hiking delivery rates to finance ambitious infrastructure projects, as well as pay for ever-rising dividends to shareholders.Overall household energy prices in the Chicago area rose 43.9% in the 12 months through June, according to the BLS. The price of gas piped into people's homes jumped 59.5%.Politicians like Gov. J.B. Pritzker are caught in a quandary. He needs utilities to put in place infrastructure to enable his vision of a carbon-free power-generation sector. But the high costs of the fuel itself threaten to make those ambitions unaffordable for a larger and larger swath of society.\u0097Steve DanielsCONSTRUCTIONConstruction costs soared during the first two years of the pandemic from a manufacturing slowdown and supply chain headaches, plus the recent surge in fuel prices. An index measuring the cost of construction materials was up 19% year over year in May, more than double the increase of the consumer price index over that span, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.Builders expect price increases of 3% to 5% per year with normal inflation, but a typical project today might cost 25% more than it would have cost at the beginning of 2020, says Andy MacGregor, president of Chicago-based Accend Construction.\"People are coming up pretty short,\" he says.It's a threat to hot real estate sectors like warehouses and apartments, where pricey rents are helping developers cover their inflated costs. Contractors aren't as willing to eat the higher costs as they were early in the pandemic when there were fewer projects to go around, says AGC Chief Economist Ken Simonson. The group's index tracking what contractors bid on projects is now virtually even with its construction cost index, signaling the price hikes are being passed along to developers.\"Contractors are getting choosier, and they're telling owners, 'OK, we'll do it, but only if you'll take the 20% (cost) increase we've had to absorb,' \" Simonson says. \"Inflation is now hitting project owners after it already hit contractors.\"\u0097Danny EckerAPARTMENTSFor many people who live in an apartment, rent is their biggest household expense by far. It's even bigger today.Rents in downtown Chicago and the suburbs have hit record highs, rising 17% or more in March from a year earlier, according to the Chicago office of Integra Realty Resources, an appraisal and consulting firm. The strong job market has boosted demand for rental housing, and developers haven't built enough apartments to match the increase in demand.For housing advocates, the surge in rents has added urgency to the debate over affordable housing and what the government should do to create more of it. In late 2021, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot disclosed a campaign to create $1 billion in affordable housing.\"If somebody's making 80% of median (income), there's very little housing that's really truly affordable to them,\" says John Bartlett, executive director of Metropolitan Tenants Organization, a tenant advocacy group.Rising rents have stretched household budgets, especially for renters with low and moderate incomes. Bartlett says that 20% of Chicago renters spend nearly half of their income on rent, while a little over 40% are spending a third of their income on rent. He notes that renters have been cutting back on other expenses, like groceries. Bartlett says that eviction filings are back up to pre-pandemic levels.Landlords have been on the receiving end of inflation, forced to absorb rising utility costs and property taxes. But they shouldn't look to Bartlett for sympathy.\"I think that many landlords are taking advantage of the times and are charging an increase in rents faster than they need to,\" he says.\u0097Corli JayCITY GOVERNMENTThanks to an automatic increase in property taxes tied to the consumer price index approved by the Chicago City Council in 2020, as inflation soars, taxpayers will be asked to keep up.Mayor Lori Lightfoot hailed the move\u0097first included in the 2021 city budget\u0097as a responsible measure to provide predictability to taxpayers and avoid asking aldermen to vote for unpopular, steep one-time property taxes. Pegged to the December-to-December rise in the consumer price index from the previous year or 5%, whichever is lower, the resulting increase for the 2022 budget was set at 1.4%, or a modest $22.9 million increase.But the CPI jumped 7% from December 2020 to December 2021, meaning the 2023 proposed increase will be capped at 5% so taxpayers won't feel the full brunt of inflation. That is, if the City Council doesn't balk at approving the supposed automatic hike.Although the CPI increase is now baked into the city's budget planning, aldermen must still approve the annual revenue appropriation, and many would like to avoid a 5% increase just months before they ask voters for a new term. But, when celebrating passage of her 2022 budget last October, Lightfoot said the annual CPI increase isn't going anywhere.Taxpayers need a predictable tax bill \"that they can plan for and isn't going to sock them right in the gut every few years because politicians wouldn't make the tough calls when they needed to,\" she said. \"Those days are over as long as I am mayor.\"\u0097Justin LaurenceRESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATELocal home prices have soared since the beginning of the pandemic, but rising mortgage rates have cooled the market\u0097and driven up the cost of using borrowed money to buy a home.Mortgage rates have risen in response to the Federal Reserve's effort to quell inflation through a series of short-term interest-rate hikes. Now, the question is whether job cuts are in the offing for companies in the residential real estate industry. In early June, two national real estate brokerages, Compass and Redfin, both announced layoffs, though they declined to say whether they planned to cut any jobs in the Chicago area. No locally based firms, including mortgage-lending giant Guaranteed Rate, have announced layoffs, either.But residential brokers work as independent contractors, so the decision of whether they will continue to work in the industry is largely up to them. Jeff Baker, CEO of Illinois Realtors, a trade group, thought he might see a sign that more agents were leaving the business in April, when all licensed realtors in the state\u009754,748 at the end of 2021\u0097had to renew their licenses.\"That would be our first opportunity to see a dip,\" Baker said, \"but all we saw was a relatively normal rate of attrition, about 7%, which is the normal number of people who are retiring\" or moving to another place.The next renewal date is April 2024, by which time the market could have multiple ups and downs.Both Baker and Ayoub Rabah, president of Coldwell Banker Realty in the Central West region, which includes the Chicago area, say they don't yet envision large numbers of agents leaving or layoffs. That's in part because while Chicago's market grew during the boom, it didn't heat up like it did in places like Phoenix and Tampa. Thus, there's not as much new extra personnel to shed.In a downturn, Rabah would expect to see \"a flight to quality, (agents) moving to the firms with a strong platform and a history of resilience.\"\u0097Dennis RodkinAGRICULTUREFarmers who grow corn and soybeans, key crops in Illinois, are performing a delicate balancing act.Farming costs, from fertilizer to seed, have shot up due to historically high inflation. But rising corn and soybean prices so far have offset elevated input expenses.\"The commodity price increases have been a godsend,\" says Mike Rauch, a corn and soybean farmer based in Tinley Park in southern Cook County, and a member of the Cook County Farm Bureau board of directors. \"Hopefully, we'll come out OK.\"The question is whether corn and soybean prices will stay high enough to protect farmers' profit margins. They've already started falling amid improved weather in the United States and Europe, which could boost the supply of grain harvested, driving down prices.The problem is that prices of fertilizer, seed and other inputs aren't likely to drop or fall as quickly even if grain prices do, according to Gary Schnitkey, a professor at the University of Illinois and contributor to the Farmdoc daily paper, \"Inflation and Commodity Prices.\" The war in Ukraine and persistent global supply chain issues should keep those costs high, he says.Farmers are at the mercy of global markets, but their fate also depends an especially unpredictable variable: Mother Nature. Though recent rains have brought some relief, June was an especially dry month in Illinois.\"I've never seen cracks in the ground this wide in June in my life,\" says Rauch, a 40-year veteran in the agriculture sector.\u0097Trina ManninoFOOD COMPANIESLocal food companies are walking an inflationary tightrope as they try to raise their prices without scaring off the new customers they gained during the pandemic.Consumers flocked to well-known brand names\u0097like Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese from Chicago-based Kraft Heinz and Oreos from Chicago-based Mondelez\u0097as they started eating at home more and sought out nostalgic brands when COVID-19 hit. But those same customers are known to decamp for cheaper brands when prices rise.Kraft Heinz's prices increased about 9% in the first quarter compared to the prior year. Sales volumes dropped 2%. Analysts say the decline would have been worse if the ketchup maker hadn't spent big on reinvigorating brands in recent years.Conagra Brands, whose portfolio includes Slim Jim, Birds Eye and Hunt's, said inflation-related price hikes boosted the dollar value of sales in the three months that ended May 29 but led to a 6.4% drop in sales volume. Mondelez, meanwhile, said it expected its packaging and ingredient costs would be up in the low double digits this year.\u0097Ally Marotti",

  "Title": "Downtown is a neighborhood, too, mayor",
  "Text": "You can see the remnants of Lollapalooza from my window here on the 32nd floor of the Prudential Building. The grass is a bit brown, but the stages are almost gone. Also unfortunately gone are the people, because for the first time in quite awhile it frankly was invigorating to see downtown Chicago busy and filled to something resembling its pre-pandemic self.You also can see something else looking out the window: Residential high-rises, dozens of them, framing Grant and Millennium parks and spilling onto neighboring streets. Buildings that will soon be joined by others, and which collectively are home to tens of thousands of residents.That's the context of the debate as Mayor Lori Lightfoot ever so slowly releases details of the new 10-year renewal deal she just struck with the Lolla folks and of the parallel pact she cut with NASCAR to have stock cars thundering through the park, down Michigan Avenue and up DuSable Lake Shore Drive.Lightfoot sees green, the kind you put in your wallet, when she looks at the park that's the center of downtown Chicago. I'm sympathetic. She needs tax revenue to run her government, and a city hospitality and tourism business that's still recovering from COVID-19 needs the spending and the free national advertisement that Lolla and NASCAR constitute.But at the same time, downtown Chicago has steadily morphed since Lolla first arrived 17 years ago into a neighborhood, a place where roughly 250,000 real people live and shop and recreate. And while that neighborhood has its unique aspects, it deserves to be treated with respect and have its needs met like any neighborhood. It's not a money pit that will just have to suck it up for the greater good, be it for Lollapalooza, NASCAR or the mayor's casino.Although she doesn't show it much, I suspect the mayor knows this truth. But the lure of cash and making a PR splash\u0097combined with her own litigious nature that treats anyone who's not 100% with her as an enemy to be destroyed\u0097results in an imperious style that is not neighborhood-friendly.Consider: Two weeks after being asked, the city and park district still haven't released key details about the NASCAR deal, such as how many streets and how much of the park will be closed to public access for how long. Or, though they've given some details, how much money local government can expect to get in exchange for turning over public property to private users.Lightfoot argues that the NASCAR deal will be worth it. Maybe it will. But downtown residents and voters everywhere deserve to see the specifics, all of them, because former Mayor Rahm Emanuel rejected a proposed NASCAR deal a few years ago on grounds that it wouldn't be worth the hassle and impact, multiple inside sources tell me.Similar questions exist about the new Lolla deal.It's been widely reported that negotiations over a new contract stalled over whether the music festival would be protected against another big hike in the city's entertainment tax, a tax which already has soared from 4% to 9% of ticket income since the last long-term contract with Lolla went into effect. So what's the truth?All the city will say is that it \"has no plans to raise costs\" on Lolla producer C3 and that \"the new contract will keep a provision in the current Lollapalooza contract that allows C3 to terminate the contract with sufficient notice and with a fee.\" But I hear that fee may be only $250,000 and the notice period a year. The city so far won't elaborate on that leaky statement.Nor has the city told aldermen much, never mind their constituents. I understand why. A mayor on the move, be they named Emanuel or Lightfoot, can find aldermen to be a pain in the butt. But that's democracy.Neighborhoods deserve respect\u0097all neighborhoods. I wish City Hall would keep that in mind.",

  "Title": "A checklist for Lightfoot\u2014and her challengers",
  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot is right that temperament, the way politicians handle themselves in public and how they fight for what they believe, is critical in government. Lightfoot embodies that herself. Her take-no-prisoners style has defined much of her tenure, for good and bad.Temperament, however, is not the only or even primary thing that counts as the city's mayoral election campaign revs up. What counts most in my book is where a pol stands on the issues that impact our collective lives. Temperament only affects how well those stances can be implemented.Ergo, here are some top issues that Chicago deserves to have this mayor and those who claim they could do the job better address head-on. No shilly-shallying. Tell us what you want to do and why you're the best to do it.The overwhelmingly top issue, truly the elephant in the room, is crime, which is about as bad as it's been in decades on the South and West sides and lately has surged into downtown and the North and Northwest sides, areas where people have the means to leave town en masse if they and theirs no longer feel safe.Lightfoot in my view is right about much of the long-term solution: reinvesting in neglected neighborhoods and the people who inhabit them, so that young people can see with their own eyes that working hard is worth it and that gang-banging is just an early ticket to the cemetery.But in the short run, laws have to be enforced, police and populace have to respect each other, and those who get out of line must know in their gut that consequences will follow.Lightfoot has pointed to a small dip in the past month or two after two years of soaring figures. That's nice, but not enough. It's obvious that a fast-shrinking police department can't do its job amid horrid morale problems if line officers are routinely expected to give up their holidays and weekends to work 60-hour weeks. It's also obvious, though, that Cook County judges, State's Attorney Kim Foxx and a Congress that won't enact reasonable limits on gun purchases also bear part of the blame\u0097as Lightfoot keeps reminding us.But that's part of the background. The next mayor has to deal with all of that. So, Lightfoot and you mayoral wannabees: What would you do differently in the next four years?Job growth\u0097creating prosperity\u0097is a kissin' cousin to the above. Again, Lightfoot's efforts to attract new jobs in her Invest South/West program are a good idea, and I'm hearing more and more praise for how Michael Fassnacht and his crew at World Business Chicago are tapping new areas of growth. Meanwhile, Loop office towers are dying, North Michigan Avenue is staggering along and, as my colleague Danny Ecker reports, the city's critical convention business has been slow to recover from the pandemic. What specifically will the next mayor do to fix that\u0097including limiting property tax hikes?Speaking of money\u0097the mother's milk of government as well as politics\u0097what will the next mayor do about Chicago's still astronomical pension debt? How will they pay for all of the well-intended but expensive social welfare programs Lightfoot has funded\u0097free gasoline vouchers, guaranteed monthly income checks, lots of violence reduction programs, et al.\u0097when federal COVID relief funds soon run out? What will they do if a recession hits?Then there's saving the Chicago Bears and revamping the city's lakefront museum complex at a price we can afford. Lightfoot will soon roll out her plan. Her foes had better be ready with theirs.One other area worth noting is ethics and reform, always an issue here. Lightfoot has taken some positive steps in limiting aldermanic prerogative in non-zoning matters. But Ald. Michele Smith, 43rd, is having a hard time getting even tougher rules past Lightfoot, and the way the mayor handled the ward remap and selecting the casino were reminiscent of old-time power politics at their worst. Would anyone else really do better?Consider that a starter list, Chicago. Let's concede Lightfoot is tough, just like her foes will say they are. Time to put them all to the test.",

  "Title": "Chicago Fire, Park District clash over Soldier Field sponsorship rights",
  "Text": "A battle has broken out over sponsorship rights at Soldier Field involving Chicago Fire FC, the Chicago Park District and the Chicago Bears, a dispute that puts a spotlight on the city's priorities for the lakefront stadium and could shape the futures of both teams at the venue.At issue is a sponsorship agreement the Fire announced in March with Wintrust Financial that made the Rosemont-based lender the \"official banking partner\" of the Major League Soccer franchise. The centerpiece of the deal was entitlement rights to the venue's playing surface, which the Fire said would be dubbed the \"Wintrust Pitch at Soldier Field\" for its home games this season.But the Chicago Park District, which owns Soldier Field, told the Fire in April that referring to the field using Wintrust's name runs afoul of the operating agreements that govern both the Fire's and the Bears' use of Soldier Field, according to correspondence reviewed by Crain's. Formally labeling the field\u0097or the \"pitch\" in soccer parlance\u0097with the Wintrust brand crosses the line into naming rights to the venue itself, the Park District argued, which neither team has the right to sell, according to the Bears' permit and operating agreement.A Park District attorney instructed the Fire in a recent email to stop using the \"Wintrust Pitch\" name to avoid a default on the MLS club's permit and operating agreement, according to correspondence between the two parties. Such a breach could block the Fire from renewing its deal to play at the stadium, which the team has sought recently with its agreement set to expire at the end of this year.The Fire, however, struck back at the Park District in a response, arguing that neither their Soldier Field agreement nor that of the Bears prevents the Fire from selling naming rights to the stadium's playing surface. The entitlement is entirely different from naming rights to the stadium itself, the Fire said in an April 19 letter, and the Fire's agreement specifically mentions the potential for selling naming rights to the field itself.The feud is playing out against a complicated backdrop. The city has been in discussions with the Bears in recent months about the team's future at Soldier Field while Bears ownership looks to buy the shuttered Arlington International Racecourse in northwest suburban Arlington Heights and redevelop it with a new stadium. The team's wish list to improve its revenue opportunities at Soldier Field\u0097if it ultimately recommits to the stadium\u0097includes more signage and sponsorship rights.The city and Park District, meanwhile, need to ensure they play by the rules of their Bears agreement to protect a massive termination fee the NFL team would have to pay to get out of their lease before its 2033 expiration. That could total as much as $84 million if the team cuts its deal short in 2026, or less if it terminates after that, the Chicago Tribune reported last year.Yet the Park District must also honor its agreement with the Fire, which relocated its home games in 2020 back to Soldier Field from suburban Bridgeview under then-new owner Joe Mansueto, the billionaire founder of Morningstar. The Fire could be the stadium's sole team tenant if the Bears leave and could be trying to pressure the city to improve the terms of their stadium deal.Mayor Lori Lightfoot has also publicly heaped praise on Mansueto for his recent investments on the city's West Side, most notably a massive office redevelopment called the Terminal in Humboldt Park and a new training facility the Fire may build next to the Illinois Medical District.'CONFIDENT IN OUR POSITION'A Fire spokesman said in a statement that the sponsorship agreement with Wintrust \"still stands\" and that the team is \"confident in our position pursuant to the terms of our lease agreement. We are proud to have Wintrust as an important part of the Chicago Fire FC family and look forward to collaborating with the Park District on this matter.\"Responding to a Crain's inquiry about whether the Fire's playing field naming rights deal with Wintrust was allowed, a spokeswoman for the Park District issued a statement that did not address the matter directly: \"The Permit and Operating Agreement between the Chicago Park District and the Chicago Fire provides for advertising rights during Chicago Fire games and events as outlined in the agreement,\" the statement said.A Bears spokesman declined to comment. Wintrust CEO Ed Wehmer said the dispute is \"between the Fire and the Park District\" and not a Wintrust issue. \"We're excited about our sponsorship. We're just trying to be Chicago's bank and support Chicago's teams,\" Wehmer said.Both the Fire and Park District have different top executives in place than the ones who negotiated the team's agreement to play at Soldier Field.Multiple Park District lawyers who oversaw Soldier Field matters have left in the wake of former CEO Mike Kelly's departure last year. The Park District is now led by Interim CEO Rosa Escareno, who previously served as commissioner of Chicago's Department of Business Affairs &amp; Consumer Protection.Mansueto, meanwhile, has installed several new people to run the team's business. The most notable is Ishwara Glassman Chrein, former head of sports partnership and business development at Yahoo Sports/Verizon Media. She took the reins as president of the Fire last June.Resolving the dispute could hinge on whether the \"Wintrust Pitch at Soldier Field\" name could be construed as naming rights to the stadium itself. Most major U.S. pro sports team venues have more simple corporate names like the United Center or Guaranteed Rate Field. But some teams have added corporate monikers to their existing stadium names. The Denver Broncos play their home games in Empower Field at Mile High, while the Kansas City Chiefs' home venue is now known as GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium.The Fire argued in their letter to the Park District that the clause in the Bears' operating agreement blocking anyone from renaming the stadium stemmed from public pushback to such a move. The lack of public complaint about the new \"Wintrust Pitch\" name illustrates that the move doesn't amount to renaming the facility itself.BEARS' CONCERNSIt's unclear whether the Bears would step into the dispute directly to help resolve it or potentially pick up more rights at the stadium. The team amended its agreement in 2015 to accommodate the city's push to develop the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art on a parking lot south of Soldier Field. The museum itself was never built, but the Bears won a slew of new signage rights in and around the stadium from the amendment.The Bears are also especially protective of their handful of top-tier corporate sponsors, a group that includes Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank\u0097a Wintrust competitor. PNC signed a deal with the Bears in 2015 that includes naming rights to an addition to Halas Hall in Lake Forest, which is now known as the PNC Center at Halas Hall. The deal also includes naming rights to what are now dubbed the PNC Suites at Soldier Field.The Bears' inability to sell naming rights to the stadium itself has been a huge damper to its revenue relative to what other NFL teams pull in from such deals. Industry experts have estimated the Bears could pull in $10 million to $20 million annually from a stadium naming rights agreement. That's one of many financial reasons the Bears would strongly consider building their own stadium in Arlington Heights.Lightfoot said in April during an interview with WSCR-AM/670 The Score that the city will make a \"compelling economic case for the Bears to stay in Chicago, far greater than they could possibly get in any suburb.\" Lightfoot in February launched a working group to study ways to inject new life into the museum campus and Soldier Field, whether or not the Bears are a long-term tenant. That group is expected to present a recommendation this summer.A Lightfoot spokesman declined to comment on the Fire-Park District dispute.Wintrust has been a big player on the local sports sponsorship scene for several years. The bank has corporate partnership agreements with both the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Cubs, the latter of which includes the company's name atop the largest video board at Wrigley Field. The lender also has the naming rights to Wintrust Arena at McCormick Place, the home venue of the WNBA's Chicago Sky.",

  "Title": "Where do Pritzker and Griffin go from here?",
  "Text": "Ken Griffin's decision to pull up stakes here shouldn't have surprised anyone, least of all Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Gov. J.B. Pritzker, specifically given the public feud between the billionaire hedge fund mogul and the billionaire politician who currently occupies the highest office in the state.Like the foolish folks who defiantly ignore dire warnings of a catastrophic hurricane while their beach house is destroyed around them, the collective ennui displayed by our government leaders at the Citadel leader's well-telegraphed decision to leave the state for tax-attractive Florida is simultaneously inexplicable and more than just a bit concerning.Most important, it should serve as a reminder that when political leaders do little to make the economic engine of the Midwest more attractive\u0097not less\u0097for business, it is business that must step up to fill the void.So, then, it's not overstating it to consider Griffin's announcement as a final wake-up call.It is time to ask who is going to step up and make the case that without a healthy business environment, few, if any, of the important programs to fix our neighborhoods, fund our important cultural institutions, attract talent and move our region forward more equitably will ever get done.Unlike the two other recent decisions by Boeing and Caterpillar to pack up and move their headquarters\u0097which hurt more from a pride and optics standpoint\u0097this pain will be felt acutely in the state's wallet and the wallets of dozens of cultural and other nonprofit institutions that received hundreds of millions of dollars from Griffin over his tenure as a Chicagoan.Like a hurricane, the damage won't be fixed overnight, no matter what data points the governor's office puts out to try to blunt the bad news.And with about 1,000 employees currently still working in the Loop for Citadel, action is needed quickly and decisively to make sure that personal agendas no longer get in the way of keeping companies and their employees here. As Crain's columnist Joe Cahill pointed out, Citadel, like so many successful companies, has helped generate other financial industry offshoots, many started by the firm's alums.Let's be clear here: There is no real winner in this departure, with maybe the exception of real estate executives in Florida. I haven't had an opportunity to ask Griffin this, but it's clear he is leaving a city that he deeply cared about. He's been vocal about the problems\u0097from crime to underfunded pensions to taxes. He had become increasingly vocal on all the issues, but especially the crime spike in Chicago.He increasingly focused his frustration on Pritzker, successfully targeting, and helping sink, the governor's ill-fated \"millionaire's tax'' plan to plug the pension hole. Griffin put $50 million behind the campaign of the mayor of Aurora to try to unseat Pritzker in this year's election. And he directed his harshest criticism on crime at the governor, even though, last we checked, the mayor oversees the city's police leadership.Instead of sitting down with Griffin, Pritzker responded with his own barbs, dismissed the Citadel founder's threats, and went on with the business of trying to get re-elected.When governors let disputes with business and political foes turn personal, the outcome usually hurts taxpayers.It didn't have to end this way. There was a time, before Pritzker's gubernatorial aspirations, the two billionaires were well aligned in their commitment to moving the city forward. When civic-minded rich people are on the same page for making things better, they take action. Most important, they talk and put petty disputes aside for the betterment of our region.So where do we go from here? Let me suggest a starting point.Soon, we will move from campaigning season to governing season. There will be time for tensions and tempers to cool.That will be the time for the occupiers of the top seats in Chicago and the state government to plan a trip together to Florida. Under the warm sun, there might be a meeting between a former Chicago billionaire and the state's most powerful leaders to talk about how to keep the remaining 1,000 or so employees on the Citadel team from following their boss down south.The discussion should happen if only to show the rest of the business leadership in Chicago and other companies considering coming here that our elected officials are indeed serious about keeping Chicago a thriving business engine.As one respected business leader told me after the Citadel news, \"When that opening exists, they should take the opportunity to run through it.''It's an important conversation to eventually have. And as a taxpayer\u0097and someone who cares deeply about business and the health of the city and state\u0097that's a trip I can get behind.As a start.Jim Kirk is publisher and executive editor of Crain's Chicago Business.",

  "Title": "Chicago business loses its clout",
  "Text": "The Chicago business exec returned my call from New York City. I asked if Manhattan had really opened up yet after COVID.\"The streets are packed,\" he replied. \"All of the stores and restaurants are open. There are building cranes everywhere.\" Then, after a pause, he sighed, \"Now I get to return to North Michigan Avenue.\"I'm picking up signs of that collective funk every day from Chicago business leaders.Yes, some good things are happening, like in the booming Fulton Market area, and in some South and West Side neighborhoods that are seeing an influx of capital due to Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Invest South/West program. Google's potential takeover and reconstruction of the dilapidated Thompson Center is real. So is a revival of the downtown apartment rental, if not condominium, market.But for every step forward, there seems to be at least one step back. Boul Mich is a shadow of the Fifth Avenue/Rodeo Drive it once was. Vacancy rates in downtown office buildings are the highest on record. Signature companies like Boeing, Caterpillar and Citadel are leaving town, with nary a word of protest from business leaders or City Hall. You can't go more than two or three days without a report of another carjacking, shooting or mugging in the heart of what's supposed to be the midcontinent's capital.Above all, there's a sense among business leaders that their clout, their ability to reach decision-makers and get what they need to keep their money here, has waned to the lowest level in many, many years. \"There's more of a sense of helplessness,\" says one veteran leader. \"There's no plan. There's no leadership.\"Some of this has been apparent for a while. For instance, no one with money stepped forward to save the Chicago Tribune from a corporate raider that has thinned it out to what on some days is almost nothing. No one did much when movie producer George Lucas and his stinkin' museum\u0097now rising in Los Angeles\u0097were hustled out of town.But the malaise only seems be deepening. The business community didn't open ts collective wallet to challenge Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi\u0097or to protect the job of Board of Review Commissioner Mike Cabonargi, who has held Kaegi's assessment hikes on business somewhat in check. It hasn't come up with a candidate to challenge the re-election bid of Lightfoot, whose heart is with social equity and just doesn't have the kind of personal, one-on-one contact with many business leaders that predecessors Rahm Emanuel and Richard M. Daley did.There's lots of reasons, some of the business community's making, others due to outside forces.For one, the days of the close-knit club of five or 10 white men who could get together for lunch and raise the money to rehab Orchestra Hall are gone. Some say that crew stayed around too long and failed to develop new, more inclusive successors. Some bright young talent is coming up\u0097I hear lots of names\u0097but they need time. And they need to work in a world in which focusing on your business rather than your city is paramount. COVID has only accentuated that.Another reason is Lightfoot. While Emanuel arguably focused too much on the moneyed set, Lightfoot is smart enough to realize that a city can't run on fumes; without tax revenues, she can't help people who need help. But a schmoozer and a hand-holder she's not, and having a staffer talk to a company isn't the same as calling CEOs herself, big shot to big shot. What she can and must do\u0097for all of Chicago's sake\u0097is get a handle on a street-violence problem that is like a cancer on the city's life. And if that means really going after Chief Judge Tim Evans and State's Attorney Kim Foxx, well, Lightfoot never has been one to mince words.Ultimately, though, Chicago business has to take care of itself. More challenges are coming quickly, like an elected school board or the growing Democratic Socialists of America caucus in the City Council. Is the business community still up to that? That's a very good question.\"Sometimes, it takes a crisis,\" says one top insider. Well, that crisis has arrived.",

  "Title": "European investor plans Loop apartment conversion",
  "Text": "The foreign investor that bought part of a vintage Loop office building in June has now acquired the rest of it, which it plans to turn into roughly 100 apartments as demand for downtown residential units soars.A high-net-worth European family advised by Swiss investment firm 4c AG paid $8.2 million last month for the upper half of the 14-story building at 79 W. Monroe St., according to sources familiar with the deal. The purchase from Chicago developer R2 came roughly four months after the same buyer paid $40.5 million for the lower half, which is almost fully leased to a school and a Walgreens location.R2 had marketed the roughly 80,000-square-foot block of space on floors eight through 14 in the building as an apartment conversion opportunity amid weak demand for downtown offices and record-high downtown apartment rents. Now the buyer plans to execute that vision, betting that the center of the Loop is poised to become more of a mixed-use neighborhood as effects of the COVID-19 pandemic fade.The project would be in line with a new initiative from Mayor Lori Lightfoot to incentivize the conversion of outmoded office buildings on and near LaSalle Street into apartments. City officials are dangling public subsidies to help finance such projects\u0097and ensure they include affordable units\u0097counting on redevelopments to help restore vibrancy in the heart of the central business district where many companies have decamped and where the rise of remote work has decimated daily foot traffic.\"The asset will be a perfect fit for people working in hybrid models and will contribute to the revamp of the Loop according to the path envisaged by the city of Chicago,\" a 4c spokesman said in a statement.R2 Principal Jason Trailov said the buyer has retained R2 as a third-party manager and adviser to help with the partial redevelopment of the Bell Federal Savings &amp; Loan building, which is known for its Weather Bell sign hanging over the corner of Monroe and Clark streets that changes color as it predicts temperature changes. Timing of the project is unclear, but there are a series of small tenants in the space today that would need to move out or be relocated to begin work.Trailov said he anticipates building out close to 100 units and that the property's zoning allows residential use, but the plan may be subject to City Council approval based on the scope of the project and if the buyer looks to tap any public financing or tax credit programs. Such incentives are often used to redevelop older buildings, projects that are frequently fraught with unforeseen costs.R2's continued involvement in the property \"demonstrates where we see this asset ultimately going, and fitting into what will hopefully be a more vibrant, 24-7 central business district,\" Trailov said.Income from the lower portion of the building may also help finance the redevelopment above. The property generated $843,000 in net cash flow in 2021, according to a Bloomberg report tied to R2's previous loan on the building. The loan was packaged with other mortgages and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, making much of the building's financial performance data publicly available.cashing outThe vast majority of the property's income comes from a Walgreens first-floor lease that has close to eight years remaining, as well as a 77,000-square-foot lease on floors two through six with Intrinsic Schools that runs through 2045. The school is locked into the lease through its first termination option at the end of 2030, according to Cook County property records.The sale of the upper floors completes a cash-out for R2 on a building it bought in 2018 with a plan to fill it up with office users. An R2 venture paid about $25 million for the leasehold interest in the property at a time when demand for downtown office space was booming. The developer signed a lease extension with Walgreens and inked the lease with Intrinsic Schools, paying an undisclosed amount on leasing commissions and to help build out the school's space.The developer paid $6 million later that year to purchase the ground beneath the building, which was owned separately by a venture of Skokie-based real estate investor David Friedman, property records show. R2 then refinanced the building in March 2020 with the $38.6 million CMBS loan, according to public records.Then came the pandemic. The building's net cash flow last year was 42% below R2's debt service for the year, according to Bloomberg loan data. With roughly a third of the building vacant and downtown office leasing prospects soft, R2 opted to subdivide the school and Walgreens spaces from the rest of the building and sell them off.R2 CEO Matt Garrison said in July that his firm's full investment in the property was less than the $40.5 million sale price for the lower portion of the building, though he declined to disclose the specific total. Cook County records show R2 paid off its mortgage in July.",

  "Title": "Lightfoot's feel-good budget forecast",
  "Text": "Call it the incredible shrinking deficit.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot's projected city budget shortfall for fiscal 2023 has shriveled from $866 million a year ago to $178 million three months ago to $128 million as of Aug. 10. The latest figure also represents a sharp decline from deficits of $722 million in fiscal 2022 and $1.2 billion in 2021.What's behind this sudden, seemingly dramatic improvement in the city's financial condition? According to Lightfoot, the sunny 2023 outlook reflects her success in shoring up Chicago's fiscal foundation for the long run.In a speech announcing the forecast, she proclaimed that \"we are now living within our means and have started on the true road to financial stability and recovery.\"A more accurate description would call the forecast a mixture of helpful short-term factors and election-year hopium. Lightfoot and the aldermen who will approve or reject her budget are all up for re-election next year.It's no secret that elected officials preparing to face the voters will use government budgets to improve their chances at the polls. They've been known to gussy up the numbers with optimistic projections and one-time revenue infusions. Above all, they shun major tax hikes on the people who will determine whether they keep their jobs.REVENUE SOURCESA closer look at Lightfoot's forecast shows these dynamics at play. For example, projected revenues include $152 million in federal COVID-19 relief money, a funding source that won't be available over the long term. The forecast also appears to count on continuing strong revenues from a range of sources, including the real estate transaction tax, the city's share of state income tax collections, and hotel and amusement taxes, all of which have been buoyed by a strong economy.Sure, these revenue sources might hold up through fiscal 2023. But how long will they last? Higher interest rates already are cooling housing markets, and eventually may tip the economy into a recession that would depress tax receipts across the board.If the 2023 budget were really the model of fiscal rectitude Lightfoot describes, it would shun shoddy practices of the past, like raising spending more than revenue. But spending rises 6% to $5.1 billion, three times the 2% revenue increase to $5 billion. Much of the spending increase reflects salary hikes for city employees and required contributions to their pension funds, an obligation that's taking a large and growing share of the budget.PERSISTENT REALITYLightfoot could have narrowed the gap by finding more places to cut spending or by seeking the full property tax increase required by legislation she championed. That legislation ties property taxes to the consumer price index. But with inflation exceeding 8%, that's a nonstarter in an election year. Instead, Lightfoot is asking for a 2.5% increase, sacrificing more than $40 million in additional revenue, based on the optimistic assumption that inflation will fall to 2.5% in fiscal 2023, which began on July 1. I know prices have started to ease, but it's a long way from 8.5% to 2.5% inflation.Even the 2.5% hike could be sacrificed to political expediency as Lightfoot works to win City Council approval of her budget. Ald. Pat Dowell, a Lightfoot ally and head of the council's budget committee, gave the game away when she told my colleague Justin Laurence that a tax increase is \"not something most elected officials want to do in an election year.\" (Don't be surprised if a bigger tax hike becomes politically doable after they're all safely re-elected.)Lightfoot's rosy scenario also may invite additional spending demands from aldermen eager to pave their re-election pathways with taxpayer dollars. After all, if city finances are in such good shape, why not underwrite more pet programs like guaranteed basic income?If you're wondering where all this leads, check out Lightfoot's projections for fiscal 2024 and 2025. Deficits roar back, tripling to $553.7 million by 2025. Driving the surge is a projected 10% rise in spending while revenues essentially flatten. And that assumes economic conditions don't worsen significantly, an eventuality that Lightfoot acknowledges could push the 2025 deficit past $1 billion.These gloomier figures highlight the persistent reality of Chicago's finances, a chronic mismatch between revenue sources and spending obligations. The city still carries a heavy debt load, massive unfunded pension liabilities and a large, well-compensated workforce. Those expenditures regularly outstrip recurring revenue.An election-year budget might divert attention from that problem, but it doesn't solve it.",

  "Title": "Lightfoot moves to extend life of huge downtown TIFs",
  "Text": "The Lightfoot administration is getting ready to extend the life of two huge downtown tax-increment financing districts, or TIFs\u0097a move that would help in the rebuilding of Union Station and construction of more affordable housing and potentially spur The 78 project in the South Loop and the equally massive Lincoln Yards development to the north.On the table is what is to believed to be 12-year extensions of the Canal/Congress TIF on the Near West Side and the Kinzie Industrial Corridor TIF, which covers the red-hot Fulton Market area and neighborhoods to the west.The two districts produced just over $120 million in TIF revenue, known as increment, in 2020, the last year for which figures are available, according to a report by Cook County Clerk Karen Yarbrough's office. That's well over a 10th of total city TIF revenue of $1.05 billion.Both districts are due to expire later this year, but extending them would allow the city to continue to tap their increment for special projects, rather than having it melt into the regular property tax stream.In an email, mayoral Press Secretary Cesar Rodriguez confirmed that the city is \"considering\" extending the two districts as well as one other he did not name, but which appears be the much smaller North Branch (South) TIF. However, he also said the city \"plans to address these TIFs at upcoming City Council meetings\" and that introduction of enabling legislation is \"pending.\"The council's next meeting is June 22.The email only gave few specifics of what they city would do with that $100 milllion-a-year-plus, but left some tantalizing hints.One recipient would be the local share of an $850 million project at Union Station that the city and state want the federal government to fund. As previously reported, that includes some renovation inside the historic station, but also the addition of a new passenger platform and extensive track construction to the south to make the station more efficient for Amtrak and Metra.HOUSINGAt Kinzie, the extension would \"support local additional affordable housing and public infrastructure,\" Rodriguez said.Rodriguez declined to elaborate, but Ald. Walter Burnett, 27th, whose ward covers most of the area, said he has been pushing for TIF money to incentivize residential developers in the area to boost their share of units that must be rented at affordable rates from 20% now to 30%.Burnett said he also wants money for a new Metra station at Ashland Avenue to serve the Fulton Market area and for related track work.He said some money also could go to infrastructure projects that would benefit the proposed Chicago gambling casino at Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street, and the Lincoln Yards development to the north and east.THE 78Beyond that, the Canal/Congress TIF is adjacent to The 78 TIF. That project has been in slow motion after the city decided not to locate the casino there, with developers seeking city TIF help for infrastructure work that casino property taxes would have funded, as previously reported.Under state law, since The 78 and Canal/Congress TIFs are adjacent to each other, revenue collected in one can be used for projects in the other, a process known as porting.Extending the life of downtown TIFs likely will draw fire from the Chicago Teachers Union and others who argue that TIFs deprive Chicago Public Schools of tax revenue. That argument is largely inaccurate but in an election year could carry some weight.If Lightfoot proceeds with the pending plan, she will be following in her own steps. Late last year, the city extended the life of the Near North TIF, which produced $39 million in increment last year.An extension would require only a majority vote of the City Council.",

  "Title": "The ward map: Fair and equitable do not apply",
  "Text": "Call it the tale of two maps\u0097or, more accurately, two wards in one map.The first stretches literally from one end of Chicago to another, a skinny pipe that snakes from almost Ashland Avenue northwest through a half a dozen neighborhoods to within two blocks of the Elmwood Park line. The other is nearly a little rectangle tucked into the far end of the Southwest Side\u0097a neat little box that now just happens to include Midway Airport.Would you be surprised to know that the first is the proposed new ward for Ald. Gil Villegas, 36th, chairman of the City Council's Latino Caucus\u0097and the second the home of Mike Madigan, who may no longer be speaker but is not without influence at City Hall?That's all you need to know about the new \"compromise\" ward map that at least 41 Chicago aldermen are expected to ratify in a few days, the map that Mayor Lori Lightfoot hailed as \"a good thing.\"In fact, it's anything but. Even by the nonexistent moral standards of reapportionment, this map is an unfair exercise of raw power that is anything but reform-minded. It begs for a court challenge.If you'll recall, this year's fight was essentially between the City Council's Latino Caucus and Black aldermen, with most white aldermen from the North and Northwest sides aligning with Black aldermen. The key question was how to redraw ward links in a city in which Black aldermen didn't want to give up a thing, even though Chicago's Black population has dropped by hundreds of thousands, and Latinos, whose population is growing and argue their City Council representation should increase.The first group was shrewd enough to hire allies of the former speaker. Like ace election lawyer Mike Kasper, and Madigan's ex-spokeswoman, and Madigan's cartographer. And lo and behold, they produced a map that, as I describe above, just happens to preserve and even strengthen the ex-speaker's 13th Ward fiefdom.The Latino bloc hired some well-known folks themselves and tried to block the majority map. But under pressure from labor unions and other groups friendly toward the ex-speaker, they eventually broke, with Socialist aldermen such as Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, cutting their own deal a few days ago, leaving Villegas to hang out to dry.Consider, though, that in a city that according to the 2020 census has 33,000 more Latino than Black residents, the map now awaiting a vote has 17 Black-majority or -plurality wards, compared with 14 for Latinos. Doesn't seem quite fair\u0097or, to use Lightfoot's word, equitable. So how did that happen?Take a look at the numbers behind the new map and you'll find that, on balance, wards on the North and Northwest sides will have thousands more residents than the citywide median population per ward, and those on the South and West sides thousands less. Ergo, Ald. Scott Waguespack will represent 57,634 residents in his new 32nd Ward, and Villegas' new 36th Ward has 57,616. But Ald. Michael Scott's new West Side 24th Ward will have only 52,205, and the South Side 20th Ward 52,207.That's a top-to-bottom deviation of just under 10%. It may pass legal muster. But it sure ought not win applause in the court of public opinion.Talk to some of the people who pushed through this map by getting the Latino Caucus to fracture and the fog machine immediately comes on.For instance, Emma Tai from Working Families United\u0097along with labor allies, it reportedly played a big role in putting together the final deal\u0097says putting competing maps to voters in a referendum would have been \"highly costly, divisive, and ultimately a problem for our vision which is multi working class solidarity.\" It was important to save the wards of Ramirez-Rosa and others like Ald. Daniel La Spata, 1st, by cutting a deal, she says.Lightfoot could intervene to break up the 13th Ward, just like she intervened to break up the 14th Ward of another powerbroker now under federal indictment, Ald. Ed Burke. But she's busy raising re-election campaign cash in Texas.Paddy Bauler was right. Chicago still ain't ready for reform.",

  "Title": "Industry keeps quiet on transfer tax hike",
  "Text": "Real estate interests have been largely silent as a proposal to fund homelessness-fighting programs by nearly tripling the transfer tax on pricey Chicago properties gains momentum.The number of aldermen sponsoring a measure authorizing a referendum on the tax hike this fall has nearly doubled since April to 17. In May, 80 members of an interfaith clergy group \u00addelivered a letter to Mayor Lori Lightfoot urging her to support the proposal, called Bring \u00adChicago Home.Meanwhile, opposition to the proposal\u0097which, based on 2021 property sales,\u00a0Crain\u0092s estimates would add about $158 million a year to the cost of buying homes or commercial property worth $1 million or more\u0097has seemingly not materialized. No press conferences, no opinion articles, no letters to the mayor.Kris Anderson, the Chicago Association of Realtors' vice president of government affairs, says the industry is holding off until the City Council formally takes up the proposal. The ballot referendum, which would be advisory only, isn't on the council's July agenda at the moment, but Anderson said he's prepared to \"activate our 17,000 members against this\" anytime it is.Yet the industry's silence has allowed advocates of the tax to frame the debate. They argue it's fair to ask the buyers of expensive real estate to foot the bill for housing the homeless.\"Anyone purchasing a million-dollar property can afford to pay a little bit extra in order to make sure others have a place to live,\" Mike Eldridge, a member of the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, which supports the tax hike, told Crain's in April.Tax supporters' arguments may well resonate with many aldermen and voters, most of whom don't own million-dollar homes. And they're not hearing counterarguments from the people who would be tapped to do the helping: buyers of upper-priced homes and of commercial property.\"The idea that if a building is large and expensive, there must be someone sitting there who has a lot of cash is incorrect,\" says Farzin Parang, executive director of the Building Owners &amp; Managers Association in Chicago. \"There's a difference between asset cost and personal income.\"Parang warns the tax hike would be another blow to Chicago's struggling commercial real estate sector, \"an industry that is under pressure already from work-at-home and COVID and the second-highest taxes in the country, and you want to further constrain it with this transfer tax increase.\"Across the country, increases in transfer taxes have been passed or proposed everywhere from New York to Los Angeles, mostly to fund housing programs. With home markets booming and newspapers trumpeting record-priced purchases, \"people see real estate taxes as low-hanging fruit,\" said Mike Kelly, director of government affairs at the New York State Association of Realtors.\"It's not a broad-based tax on everyone,\" Kelly said. \"It's a tax that only impacts people who are buying or selling these expensive properties. That looks better to legislators.\" In 2019, the state raised transfer taxes on high-end properties in New York City only. Homes sold for $1 million or more had been subject to a special transfer tax since 1989; now those sold for $2 million and up pay an additional tax, rising from 0.25% for a $2 million property to 2.9% for those over $25 million.AFFORDABILITYIn Los Angeles, November's ballot will include a referendum along the lines of what's proposed in Chicago. Real estate groups are pushing back against the idea.\"It's wrong to go after (transfer) taxes because affordability is so absolutely crazy hard in California now,\" said Ryan Ole Hass, a broker at Align RE in Santa Monica and immediate past president of Greater Los Angeles Realtors. \"Making it more difficult to buy a home is not helping our housing crisis.\"As Chicago's real estate transfer tax now stands, a buyer pays $7,500 for every $1 million in purchase price, and the seller pays $3,000. Bring Chicago Home's proposal would more than triple the buyer's tax, to $26,500 per $1 million. Sellers would see no increase.In April, Crain's calculated that in the recent $415 million sale of a 50-story Wacker Drive office building, the New York-based buyer paid about $3.1 million in transfer taxes to the city of Chicago. Under the Bring Chicago Home proposal, the buyer would have paid nearly $11 million in transfer taxes, with the entire difference, more than $7.88 million, going to the homelessness fight. Representatives of the buyer, Opal Holdings, did not respond to Crain's request for comment.When a deal's cost increases from $418 million to $426 million, the difference, Parang notes, \"is going to come from tenants, in higher rents\" that the buyer likely will charge.\"Rents are already under a lot of pressure,\" Parang says.In residential transactions, buyers are likely to factor the boosted transfer tax into the total cost of buying, potentially limiting the price they can afford to pay and weighing down home values.In the headline-grabbing $20 million sale of the penthouse at the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower this spring, the buyer paid $150,000 in transfer taxes, but would have paid $530,000 under Bring Chicago Home. Perhaps the difference, $380,000, is mere pocket change to the yet-unidentified buyer, who may have additional millions to lay out in order to finish the mostly raw penthouse space.But CAR's Anderson and Mario Greco, a Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices agent who's active in the city's luxury-priced home market, point out that buyers of $1 million homes in Chicago are often stretching their wallets. Under current lending guidelines, a household with an income of about $245,000 could swing the mortgage on a million-dollar home. That's a healthy income, but certainly doesn't count among the ultra-wealthy who can spend with abandon.Increase the transfer tax they'll pay from $7,500 to $26,500, and \"you might hear some vocal opposition,\" Greco says, \"but probably not in this city that's used to being pummeled with fees and taxes. If you love this city, you might put up with another tax.\"Anderson is not so sanguine, warning that buyers facing an additional $23,000 in taxes might \"choose the suburbs, choose Indiana or Michigan.\"Bring Chicago Home would put the full burden of the increase on buyers, who are already losing affordability as home prices and mortgage interest rates rise.Connecticut takes the opposite approach, imposing its transfer tax\u0097called a conveyance tax\u0097on sellers. In 2019, the Connecticut Association of Realtors unsuccessfully fought a proposal to increase the conveyance tax on high-priced homes and use the money to fund open-space preservation. The market was slow then, and Tammy Felenstein, an agent at William Raveis in Southport, Conn., and 2022 president of the association, said the industry expected the tax increase to anger sellers.But any market impact of the tax increase was overwhelmed by the pandemic-driven housing boom, which kicked in about the same time the tax went up. Large numbers of New Yorkers house hunting in Connecticut sent prices skyward.\"It's not to say that the sellers aren't upset that they're paying additional conveyance taxes,\" Felenstein said, \"but they're so happy with the sales prices they're getting that they're not complaining.\"",

  "Title": "Team Lightfoot disputes 'city in crisis' narrative",
  "Text": "Arguing that Chicago is getting bad rap that at least in part is unfair, City Hall is counterattacking on a recent speech by McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski, who asserted in remarks before the Economic Club of Chicago on Sept. 14 that high crime levels are taking a meaningful toll on the city's economic competitiveness.In a letter released Sept. 21, Michael Fassnacht, head of the city's World Business Chicago corporate recruitment arm, writes that Kempczinski's take, which received national media coverage, was \"incomplete\" and that the truth of where the city stands is \"complex.\"\"A headline like 'Chicago Is In Crisis' makes for good media copy, but it doesn't capture the complexity of the city's situation,\" the letter says. \"We can only address and solve the challenges when we are honest about what got us to where we are and how we can work together.\"The same tone\u0097at times strikingly candid, while defending the city\u0097continues through the five-page note. The letter is addressed to members of the Economic Club, the leadership forum that was the venue for Kempczinski's Sept. 14 speech.In an interview with Crain's on Sept. 21, Fassnacht said the idea of writing the letter was his, but he conceded he discussed it with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who chairs the WBC board and does not need bad publicity as she embarks on what may be a challenging re-election race.The letter asserts that a record 173 companies moved to or significantly expanded in the city last year, and it contends the city \"is on a similar trajectory\" this year with 121 such decisions so far. The 112 companies that are entirely new to the city in the past 18 months created more than 19,000 direct or indirect jobs, it notes.BRIGHT SPOTSThe letter also discusses at length Lightfoot's signature Invest South/West campaign to lure development to long-neglected neighborhoods. And it points to Chicago's transportation and hospitality industries as bright spots that have enjoyed a relatively quick recovery from the COVID pandemic.Particularly notable, though, is a direct challenge to the gist of Kempczinski's speech. The letter terms \"myth\" the notion that Chicago is home to fewer headquarters of larger corporations than it used to be, despite the departure of Boeing and Citadel in the city proper and Caterpillar in suburban Cook County.In the interview, Fassnacht took a softer tone. Asked directly if the perception is growing that Chicago is too dangerous of a place to expand or attract talent, Fassnacht replied, \"If you look at the national media, it is one of the big challenges we have . . . even if it is not entirely true or fair.\"Fassnacht ducked most questions about crime, saying that's not his job. The letter asserts that, despite complaints from Kempczinski and earlier from Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown has a plan to deal with safety issues, and some progress has been made.The latest figures on the police department's website show a somewhat different picture.For instance, while the number of murders in the city is down 16% so far compared with the same period in 2021\u0097dropping to 497 from 591\u0097the figure remains well above the level of other recent years and much higher than statistics in New York City and Los Angeles.The number of reported shooting incidents is down a little more year to date, 18%. But burglaries and robberies are up by double digits each, and the reported number of motor vehicle thefts has soared 69% so far this year.Fassnacht's letter suggests that businesses meet with their local police leadership to dialogue, and urges businesses not to support politicians who oppose \"reasonable gun safety policies.\"Asking for a show of hands during his Sept. 14 speech, McDonald's chief Kempczinski asked his audience of business and civic leaders how many of them were aware of the city's public safety plan. Few hands rose.While affirming McDonald's commitment to Chicago as its home base, Kempczinski described the difficulties created by Chicago's deteriorating reputation on the crime front.\"There's a general sense out there that our city is in crisis,\" he said. \"The truth is, it's more difficult today for me to convince (a McDonald's executive) to relocate to Chicago from one of our other offices than it was just a few years ago. It's more difficult for me to recruit a new employee to McDonald's to join us in Chicago than it was in the past.\"'LET US KNOW THE PLAN'Kempczinski acknowledged that corporate Chicago has a role to play in combating crime and improving public safety. \"Let us know the plan so we can support it,\" Kempczinski said. \"It's going to take partnership.\"On Sept. 20, Fassnacht met with McDonald's U.S. President and World Business Chicago board member Joe Erlinger, CPD's Brown and First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter, at McDonald's headquarters. Public safety was a topic of the conversation.At a press conference following the Sept. 21 City Council session, Lightfoot took a jab at Kempczinski, implying fairly plainly that the executive didn't know what he was talking about regarding her administration's public safety strategy.\"What would have been helpful is if the McDonald's CEO had educated himself before he spoke,\" Lightfoot said. \"We had those productive conversations with other members of his leadership team; I think you saw that McDonald's itself put out a full page ad talking about their full support of the city of Chicago.\" She added that she preferred not to \"look in the rear-view mirror\" and instead aimed to focus on \"productive engagement\" with the McDonald's team.Justin Laurence contributed.",

  "Title": "WEALTH-BUILDING THROUGH FOOD",
  "Text": "Hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans go to bed hungry or fill their stomachs with empty calories because that's all they can find or afford.They ration food, depend on charitable donations or agonize over how to stretch their budgets to pay for meals to get them through the day.These aren't Dickensian characters. This is 21st-century reality for many people living in a major U.S. city.Riverdale on Chicago's Far Southeast Side is 95% African American\u0097and 99.85% of residents there have \"low access\" to food, defined as living more than a half-mile from the nearest supermarket, according to the Chicago Health Atlas.On the Near North Side, where 70% of residents are white, everyone lives within a half-mile of at least one supermarket, giving them abundant grocery choices.A McKinsey analysis last year found that counties in the U.S. with above-average Black populations had fewer grocers, restaurants and farmers markets and more small convenience stores.Those statistics underscore a glaring racial and economic disparity and help explain why some Chicago communities struggle more than others with food insecurity and convenient access to fresh and healthy foods.\"Some neighborhoods are overly serviced and others are barely serviced,\" says LaForce Baker, vice president of community impact at World Business Chicago, which works to attract businesses to low-access areas.Traveling farther away from home to buy food can pose challenges, especially for seniors and people living with disabilities, among those most at risk for food insecurity.Money spent elsewhere also means fewer dollars get recirculated in under-resourced communities.Yellow Banana, a retail grocer, owns and operates 38 stores in five states under the Save A Lot banner, with six locations in Chicago. The company's four founders\u0097two are Black and one is Black and Latino\u0097feel a moral obligation to operate stores in underserved communities.\"Where you live shouldn't dictate your access to healthy, affordable food,\" says co-founder Michael Nance, who is African American and Latino.The closings of Aldi stores in West Garfield Park and Auburn Gresham and a Whole Foods Market in Englewood have focused renewed attention on the city's \"food deserts.\"Chicago political leaders, activists and entrepreneurs have vowed to step up efforts to bring more healthy food to underserved areas.BULLETPROOF GLASS AND CHEESEBURGERSYellow Banana is an example of one such effort. The company plans to buy a Save A Lot grocery store in Auburn Gresham that closed in 2020 and reopen it in early 2023.Earlier this year, the company received a $13.5 million community development grant to purchase and remodel stores on the West and South sides. Save A Lot is one of the nation's largest discount grocery chains. Yellow Banana is its third-largest retail partner.Other efforts to improve access include food pantry expansions and the launching of farmers markets, pop-up farm stands, and small and midsize urban farms. Some residents are learning to grow their own produce.David Edwards is tackling food inequity on multiple fronts.\"What I'm trying to accomplish is to fill up a lot of these food deserts here in Chicago,\" says Edwards, who owns a produce business and the Smooth &amp; Social Roots Cafe in Garfield Park. He wants to one day open a grocery store on the West Side.The cafe serves smoothies and Caribbean- and Cajun-inspired dishes, some of which are made with produce grown in an adjacent garden and at two nearby farms. Edwards participated in the Chicago Botanic Garden's Windy City Harvest apprenticeship and farm incubator programs, which have trained and supported many farmers of color.\"I don't want people in my community to have to go to places with bulletproof glass and have to order cheeseburgers and stuff,\" Edwards says. \"I want them to be able to have someplace where they can come in and order healthy food and sit down to eat comfortably.\"MORE PEOPLE ARE FOOD INSECUREThe Greater Chicago Food Depository has identified 40 high-priority food-insecure communities in Cook County, with 28 in the city and 12 in the suburbs.Its partner network served almost 361,600 households in August 2022\u0097a 30% jump from the previous August.A complex problem with deep roots in the city's racial history, food insecurity is a major contributor to health disparities, experts say.Chicago, like many American cities, has \"a history of redlining and disinvestment that, in turn, impacts multiple access points for food,\" says Ruby Ferguson, who leads the Chicago Food Equity Council.The council, formed by executive order in February by Mayor Lori Lightfoot, aims to achieve food equity by bringing together city departments, community organizations and various agencies \"to reimagine and transform\" the city's food system.Five high-impact priorities have been identified, including: removing barriers to urban farming and food pantry expansion; better connecting residents with nutrition programs; leveraging city and institutional procurement to assist local growers, producers and food businesses of color; and supporting food entrepreneurs of color.The mayor's Chicago Recovery Plan committed $10 million to capital investments in urban agriculture, the creation of a food incubator and development of a Chicago Good Food Fund, where entrepreneurs on the South and West sides can seek capital.Ferguson, a dietitian by training, says the council's work will ensure that \"communities that have a history of disinvestment have pathways to wealth-building through food.\"DISMANTLING 'FOOD APARTHEID'Liz Abunaw, an upstate New York native who settled in Chicago after earning an MBA at the University of Chicago, was struck by the lack of retail businesses on a West Side commercial corridor, where she found herself while trying to find a place to get cash in 2016.\"I quickly realized that it was not easy to do basic life errands there,\" she says. \"I couldn't find a grocery store. I couldn't find a bank. I couldn't find a pharmacy. All I was trying to do was get cash without paying exorbitant ATM fees.\"Abunaw, who uses the term \"food apartheid\" to refer to the race, class and other structural forces that drive food inequity, decided to do something about it.She started Forty Acres Fresh Market in 2018 with a pop-up farm stand on the West Side and later expanded to the weekly Austin Town Hall City Market, which had its last day for the year in late October. She accepts Link, the debit card for the state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps).\"Most of our customers come to us because of the mission,\" she says. \"They stay with us because they get really great quality produce at a really great value.\"While most of her business centers on residential delivery in Chicago and the western suburbs, she also sells produce to organizations and operates pop-up markets in underserved communities. Commercial development of a 10,000-square-foot grocery store on Chicago Avenue in the Austin neighborhood is underway.Grocery stores play a key role in neighborhoods.\"They are not simply transactional places to sell food,\" Abunaw says. \"You have social interactions there that create community bonds and make neighborhoods enjoyable places to live.\"THE LINK BETWEEN FOOD AND JOBSOrganizations such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository and Windy City Harvest have provided support to emerging farms owned by people of color.Windy City Harvest provides paid training in the food system for more than 150 people annually, including an apprenticeship program in partnership with the City Colleges of Chicago and a re-entry program for people leaving the criminal justice system.Graduates of the programs earn certification in areas such as food handling, sustainable urban agriculture, sustainable urban horticulture and environmental literacy.Since 2013, it has incubated 26 small farm businesses, the majority owned by people of color.Yellow Banana prioritizes local residents in its hiring, viewing its mandate as threefold: \"addressing food security, employment and being a part of local economic development,\" says co-founder Ademola Adewale-Sadik.Growing Home, a U.S. Department of Agriculture-certified organic, high-production urban farm in Englewood, also shares the mission of food production and paid job training.The farm grows an average of 40,000 pounds of food annually on 1.5 acres, including 145 varieties of produce, says Executive Director Janelle St. John. Its placement rate for those seeking full-time employment averages 80%.Growing Home's community-supported agriculture program, or CSA, sells to the general public. Last year it launched its Englewood CSA, which provides free food every other week to 30 households.Food giveaways also take place at events such as the organization's Harvest and Winter festivals, and about 125 packages of food are delivered weekly to two food pantries.But St. John says expanding access is not just about giveaways, but also ensuring affordability to paying customers.\"What we sell on the North Side for $1, we sell for 50 cents in Englewood,\" she says. \"If you have Link, it is an additional 50% off. We also take senior citizen coupons. We do that with our local markets and pop-ups.\"They have partnered with the University of Illinois Chicago's Englewood clinic to provide fresh produce to about 25 patients with diabetes and other food-related chronic conditions.Growing Home also offers cooking demonstrations, recipe cards and other services to show customers how to prepare meals in a healthy way.NUTRITION CLOSE TO HOMEWhen Benita Lindsey lived in South Shore seven years ago, she traveled up to an hour to reach a supermarket. She didn't have a car at the time, so she rode public transit. But now that the retired government worker lives in Englewood, she shops at Growing Home.She especially enjoys its peaches, pears, tomatoes and greens of all types.For the last four years, she and a neighbor have volunteered every Thursday to pack donation boxes and assist on market days. She thinks that many in her community are unaware of Growing Home and are missing out.\"In this neighborhood, I think that's why we have so much diabetes and cancer, because we are not eating right,\" she says.The pandemic caused demand to skyrocket at Pan de Vida starting in April 2020, when the Little Village food pantry was feeding 400 families weekly. By June, it was feeding 6,000 families through drive-ups and home deliveries, with the help of the Greater Chicago Food Depository. That was about 30,000 people.In June, the pantry moved into a remodeled grocery space and was renamed Pan de Vida Fresh Market by its owners, New Life Centers and New Life Community Church Little Village. With shopping carts, Spanish music playing and brightly colored murals outside, it doesn't look like the typical food pantry.Residents can select their own items, up to 50 pounds of food once a week, says Rosario Dominguez, communications and marketing director at New Life Centers. Up to 150 families are served daily, Tuesday through Saturday. An outdoor produce market operates every other Friday.Many of the seniors who visit the pantry live alone, Dominguez says. \"The staff is definitely aware of that, and they're willing to be a listening ear for them and to see their needs beyond just the food.\"STRUGGLING TO STAY AFLOATLike the communities where they're located, some food businesses are struggling.Cedillo's Fresh Produce, an immigrant-owned family farm, has faced multiple challenges this year.Without employees during the growing season, co-owners Juan Carlos Cedillo and his wife, Dulce Margarita Morales, ran their farm with the help of their two daughters and volunteers.\"We could always use more hands,\" says Morales, co-founder of Mercado de Colores, a farmers market in Little Village, and Colectiva Ukulima, a collective of farmers of color.They also could use assistance with accounting and record-keeping, and they needed help this year with utility bills.\"We definitely felt the economy hit us hard this year,\" Morales says.But they didn't raise prices.\"We're not making enough money for us to become rich, but we're not going to say we're failing,\" Morales says. \"We are succeeding at providing for our community.\"'COME HELL OR HIGH WATER'Fueled by the COVID pandemic, Edwards' organic produce business took off. It delivers to homes, restaurants, food cooperatives and larger CSAs.His produce varies depending on the season and might include Swiss chard, kale, blueberries, bananas, oranges, organic honey, carrots and beets.But his Smooth &amp; Social Roots Cafe, which has an on-site garden and chicken coop, is still establishing itself. Confident there's a market for it, Edwards is elevating his social media presence to get the word out.At Yellow Banana, the owners realize they need to succeed where other grocers have failed.Ensuring success means \"constantly adapting and thinking about the operational side of things so that we can deliver affordable nutrition to working families, which is our mandate,\" says Adewale-Sadik.Competitor checks are conducted weekly to ensure bargain prices for staples, such as eggs, butter, milk and cooking oil. \"We've made a commitment to our customers that come hell or high water, they can come to our stores to get the best price on those core items,\" Nance says.Yellow Banana also is thinking about starting a transportation service limited to certain days and locations.And Ferguson says the Chicago Food Equity Council is looking at the big picture and not relying on a single store or solution to end long-standing inequity.\"When we go grocery shopping, we might stop and get coffee. We might go to the butcher. We might get a cupcake for a friend to celebrate their birthday,\" she says. \"We're thinking about that entire food ecosystem and how businesses can support each other and people can have choices.\"",

  "Title": "An O'Hare express is worth another shot",
  "Text": "A request for federal dollars to modernize Chicago's Union Station also envisions another long-overdue infrastructure investment: express rail service between O'Hare International Airport and downtown.As my colleague Greg Hinz reported, a consortium of local and state governments and transit agencies is seeking money for a massive project that would not only rebuild the decrepit train station and improve other rail infrastructure around the region, but also create a pathway for new service from O'Hare to Union Station and on to the McCormick Place convention center. The proposal from commuter rail service Metra, the city of Chicago, Cook County, Amtrak and the states of Illinois and Michigan asks for hundreds of millions from President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure package to finance the work.This is the kind of collaborative, forward-thinking approach to transportation that Chicago needs to thrive in the 21st century.World-class cities have world-class transit infrastructure, a bar that's always rising. Chicago has some key components of such a system, including an airport with worldwide connections and a commuter rail network linking its central business district with towns as far as 75 miles away.THINK GLOBALLYOne notably missing piece is an efficient link between that airport and downtown Chicago. Travelers headed downtown from O'Hare have two unpleasant options: a cab ride that will cost upward of $40 and take as long as an hour, or a 40-minute, multiple-stop ride on CTA cars that weren't designed to accommodate travelers with luggage.Compare that to travelers' experience in other cities that Chicago competes with in a global economy. From London to Hong Kong and Stockholm to Tokyo, airport express trains whisk passengers from airports to city centers and back again, often in less than half an hour each way. In Zurich, the trip takes 11 minutes.U.S. cities have been slower to embrace the concept, although Toronto's five-year-old airport express train is doing well after a slow start.Offering airport express service would set Chicago apart from domestic rivals and help the city maintain its status as an international business center. To play in that league, Chicago must match the offerings of other commercial hubs around the world.City leaders recognized the importance of meeting the expectations of an increasingly globalized business community when they launched the $8.5 billion terminal modernization and expansion project at O'Hare. The project is aimed at attracting more international traffic, which would bring more travelers accustomed to airport express service. Delivering that service would help make the project a success.CONVENTION HELPAirport express service also would help Chicago's convention industry, an important economic engine hurt badly by restrictions on large gatherings during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rail improvements proposed in the funding request would allow express trains to run from O'Hare to McCormick Place after a stop at Union Station.Conventioners would be able to travel directly from O'Hare to McCormick Place and back, probably in less than half an hour, on trains with comfortable seating and space to stow luggage. U.S. cities that compete with Chicago for conventions don't offer that level of convenience.Of course, the idea of airport express service has been kicking around for years without coming to fruition. Former Chicago mayors Richard Daley and Rahm Emanuel tried but couldn't make it happen. Elon Musk's proposal for a high-speed underground train went nowhere.As a candidate, current Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Chicago didn't need an O'Hare express train. But she's said little on the subject since, and Chicago did sign off on the infrastructure funding request that includes it. She also has been looking for ways to revive a local tourism and convention industry decimated by COVID.The possible availability of federal money for infrastructure work might improve the odds of success this time. On the other hand, the feds might reject the request. Lots of transportation proposals around the country are vying for the infrastructure money.Still, the potential benefits of airport express service make it a goal worth pursuing, especially now. Chicago needs to up its game coming out of the pandemic. Restoring the status quo won't cut it. Chicago needs to show the world that it's not only open for business again, but looking to the future.An airport express train would send that message.",

  "Title": "Chicago's marketing makeover",
  "Text": "Lynn Osmond has made a career out of opening minds to new experiences. In her new role as Chicago's top tourism official, her challenge is changing minds about a city battered by a drumbeat of bad press.She spent the past quarter-century popularizing architecture as head of the Chicago Architecture Center. Before that, she built mainstream audiences for classical music as a symphony executive in New York, California and her native Canada.\"You've got to get them in through the John Williams and the popular music before they go into the Prokofievs and the Mahlers,\" Osmond says.Now she is selling another product that could use a public image boost: Chicago. As the city's COVID-pummeled hospitality sector labors to recover from the public health crisis, hopes for improving a national reputation sullied by crime and the pandemic are pinned in an outsize way on Osmond. The 65-year-old started in May as CEO of Choose Chicago, the agency that promotes Chicago as a convention and vacation destination.Her task of rebooting leisure and business travel to Chicago amid persistently negative storylines would daunt any experienced salesperson, let alone one with no prior experience running a convention and visitors bureau.With the health of the McCormick Place convention center\u0097one of the area's most important economic engines\u0097at stake, she'll have to succeed with a smaller staff and budget than her predecessors had.Osmond has some wind at her back as the pandemic wanes. Leisure travel has recently returned at a faster clip, with downtown hotel revenues exceeding 2019 averages in two of the past four months, according to hospitality data and analytics firm STR. Conventions and trade shows are back\u0097albeit with crowds that in many cases are smaller than they were before COVID\u0097and Osmond enjoys broad support from local civic and cultural leaders who have known her for more than two decades.But with inflation and a slowing economy weighing down travel budgets, achieving her ambitious goal of drawing close to 54 million visitors to the city next year\u0097nearly 90% of 2019's record-high figure and up from 30.7 million last year\u0097will likely require a dramatic improvement of Chicago's real and perceived problems.\"We need, as Chicagoans, to get our mojo back and start talking about why we love this city,\" Osmond says. \"That's my job. To start, locally, making Chicagoans proud.\"Osmond spent her first five months on the job rebuilding Choose Chicago's workforce, adding eight staffers for a full-time headcount of 56 people today, down from roughly 75 before the pandemic. Most notable is Dustin Arnheim, hired from Baltimore's tourism agency as her second in command. He is charged with stabilizing Chicago's convention and meetings business, a sector that traditionally accounts for 1 out of every 5 hotel room nights downtown.Arnheim's role was perhaps the most glaring vacancy for Choose as convention organizers considered other markets that were reallowing large gatherings earlier than Chicago. The National Confectioners Association's Sweets and Snacks Expo moved to Indianapolis last year for that reason, and recently announced the show would begin alternating between Indianapolis and Las Vegas from 2024 through 2032.SELLING POINTSOsmond says Chicago's strongest selling points have always been the vitality of its hotels and restaurants and its arts and culture scene. That's why she is focused on convincing event clients and tourists that crime is not out of control and that downtown remains vibrant. She is quick to point out, among other positives, that Chicago was recently named the \"best big city in the U.S.\" by Conde Nast Traveler for the sixth consecutive year.Osmond's background is far different from those of predecessors Don Welsh and David Whitaker, who were well versed in marketing tactics for major cities after running tourism agencies elsewhere, and mostly measured success by hotel occupancy and room rates.Osmond, a former clarinet player with a degree in music from Queen's University in Ontario, has spent the last 25 years overseeing a tourist attraction in the Chicago Architecture Center, known for architecture boat tours on the Chicago River. Her assessment of local tourism's well-being is more closely tied to local cultural institutions like the one she ran.Keeping McCormick Place and hotels as full as possible is crucial, \"but it's really important that the museums are healthy, it's really important that performing arts are (healthy), that our neighborhoods are healthy, that our restaurants are healthy,\" she says. Convention and trade show planners \"are saying, 'We really want to sell Chicago (to attendees and exhibitors) holistically, not just McCormick Place. We want to sell you as a destination.' So that's really what our focus has been.\"Osmond plans to lean on her relationships across Chicago's civic and corporate landscape to help spread the positive word on the city. The West Loop resident has ties to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who appointed her in 2019 to the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. Her business connections include BMO Financial Group Chairman David Jacobson, Underwriters Laboratories CEO Jenny Scanlon and Related Midwest President Curt Bailey.\"She has an intimate knowledge of what we do here,\" says John Curran, a former Choose Chicago executive who is now senior vice president and general manager of tour bus operator Big Bus Tours. He says Osmond's connections make her better-suited than her predecessors to quickly rally support for her broad pro-Chicago push, and she has more marketing chops than most people realize. \"She was very good at creating a narrative of 'wind in your hair, sun on your face' \" as her architecture boat tours grew to a fleet of six vessels today, Curran says.A former Choose Chicago board member, Osmond served on the initial search committee to replace Whitaker after his contract expired last year. But after six months of fruitless hunting raised concerns across Chicago's hospitality sector about the difficulty of the job and a potential lack of resources to do it\u0097the committee turned to her. \"I thought it was my obligation,\" she says.In a statement on Osmond, a Lightfoot spokeswoman says that a \"fresh perspective was needed to rethink how to attract tourists and business travelers alike. Lynn is that new thinker who has an impressive track record leading the Chicago Architecture Foundation and is a passionate advocate for Chicago.\"Osmond shrugs off her lack of experience running a tourism agency, noting that she spent years marketing Chicago as a destination at architecture-related events around the world. She says her knack for forging strong relationships with donors to the CAC translates well to working with groups that stage big meetings and conventions across the city.Those skills came in handy after McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski called Chicago a city \"in crisis\" in his Sept. 14 comments to the Economic Club of Chicago. Osmond worked the phones as calls came in to Choose from event organizers worried their exhibitors might be scared off from attending. None pulled out of Chicago, according to a Choose spokesman.\"We have to be careful about washing our linen in public, because that tail comes back to hit us,\" she says.METHODSOsmond is using some traditional methods to try to shape public perceptions of Chicago, including a \"When You Go You Know\" ad campaign that launched in June and will continue \"for a few years,\" she says. Choose is also spotlighting Chicago's best attributes on fast-growing video app TikTok, recently hiring San Francisco-based travel-focused production company Matador Network to help it generate Chicago promotional content on the platform.Yet Choose's shrunken budget\u0097which relies heavily on pandemic-battered hotel tax revenue\u0097will require hard choices on how to dole out scarce resources. The agency had roughly $26 million to work with this year, down from $31 million in 2019. Its 2023 budget has not been finalized, but a source familiar with the planning says it will likely be close to $28 million.By comparison, the 2022 budget for New York City's tourism arm was $63.1 million, according to its most recent annual report. The comparable budget for Orlando, Fla., one of Chicago's chief rivals for conventions and trade shows, was $67.3 million, Visit Orlando records show.Osmond grew the CAC's budget from $2.5 million to $25 million, and she sees opportunities to pad Choose's coffers with more sponsorship revenue tied to high-profile events like the James Beard Foundation Awards or major sporting events. She pulled off big partnerships while leading the CAC, inking a deal with Allstate in 2011 to sponsor the inaugural Open House Chicago weekend festival.Osmond faces several recruitment tests in 2023, an off year for a couple of the biggest shows at McCormick Place. Her first chance to notch a big win is imminent as the city vies to host the 2024 Democratic National Convention, with a decision expected early next year.",

In 2017, 77% of toxic substance releases in Chicago occurred there, according to the EPA.\"This plot right here used to hold coal ash,\" environmental justice advocate Gina Ramirez says during a recent drive through the Southeast Side, where she grew up and still lives. \"It was three stories tall and uncovered for almost all of my life\u0097until we started complaining.\"The U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development launched a two-year investigation in 2020 after three environmental justice groups complained that Chicago officials repeatedly steered polluting industries from mostly white neighborhoods to largely Black and Latino communities.In a letter last month to Mayor Lori Lightfoot, HUD sided with the advocates.The federal agency could withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in funding if the city fails to reform its zoning and land use policies, which HUD determined were racially discriminatory.\"We will respond given the opportunity, but any allegations that we have done something to compromise the health and safety of our Black and Brown communities are absolutely absurd,\" a statement from the mayor's office said. \"We will demonstrate that and prove them wrong.\"Air quality, overall, has improved in the Chicago area, with the exception of ozone.But air pollution continues to disproportionately affect some communities of color, especially those with major highways and heavy industry.The impact has been far-reaching.\"The clustering of industries has led to significant pockets of pollution and degraded air quality, sometimes degraded soil and water,\" says U.S. EPA Regional Administrator Debra Shore. \"And now we're facing the consequences.\"Children are particularly vulnerable because they breathe more air, eat more food and drink more water per body weight than adults, says Dr. Susan Buchanan, clinical associate professor of environmental and occupational health sciences at the UIC School of Public Health.\"Anything that's in the air, water or soil is going to affect children more,\" she says.Air pollution is linked to asthma and other lung problems, smaller birth weights and premature births. \"We also have evidence of neurocognitive effects of particulate matter because it crosses the placenta and gets to the fetal brain,\" Buchanan says.Furthermore, pollution's corrosive effects go beyond health. It depresses housing values.Marcus Casey, associate professor of economics at the University of Illinois Chicago, says a complicated interplay of factors influence property values and the ability of individuals to build wealth in neighborhoods near polluting industries.Inexpensive properties and cheap land draw both industry and residents with limited means. Over many decades, redlining and other racist real estate practices brand Black and Latino neighborhoods as undesirable, encouraging municipalities to allow heavy industry to amass there.But clearly a low-income neighborhood's exposure to significant pollution hurts housing values, Casey says, which \"further reduces some of the pathways out of poverty, which can lead to persistent intergenerational poverty.\"HELPING A COMMUNITY HEALEnvironmental justice advocates are calling for greater accountability and transparency from political leaders, government agencies and manufacturers.\"If we had rules and regulations to fix the permitting laws that exist right now, we wouldn't be taking this Whac-a-Mole approach,\" says Ramirez, board president of the Southeast Environmental Task Force, one of the groups that filed the complaint with HUD. \"These communities have been sacrifice zones long enough.\"A \"cumulative burden\" ordinance being pushed by advocates would limit the number of polluting industries that could locate in a given area. Chicago officials, who for the first time have agreed to conduct a citywide cumulative impact assessment, say they embrace the idea.The impact assessment, says Megan Cunningham, managing deputy commissioner at the Chicago Department of Public Health, \"has the potential to be transformational in driving policy changes that are going to be more protective of these more highly burdened neighborhoods.\"A cumulative impact ordinance would \"bring a sense of clarity and predictability,\" adds Cunningham, \"so that businesses and communities know what to expect and how decisions are being made about industrial zoning and enforcement efforts.\"Environmental justice advocates are tallying big wins.They blocked plans to open a new scrap metal facility on the Southeast Side and successfully pressured the city to postpone a $500 million city contract after expressing concerns about one of the bidders, an asphalt manufacturer in the McKinley Park neighborhood.Regulations have been tightened on large recycling centers and on manufacturers handling manganese, a heavy metal used in steelmaking that can cause brain damage after prolonged exposure, especially in children.An ordinance passed last year requires traffic and air quality studies and greater efforts to engage community residents. It also bans new incinerators, landfills and mining operations in the city.Advocates are pressing for stronger action against Hilco Redevelopment Partners after it demolished the former Crawford Power Plant smokestack in April 2020. A particulate dust cloud from the implosion engulfed homes in a large section of the Little Village neighborhood.Lightfoot issued a letter to Hilco, demanding swift action to clean up the area around the site, including addressing any deposited dust from the implosion.The city inspector general's summary report faulted both Hilco and the city. Aldermen passed a resolution in July calling for release of the complete report.At a June news conference, Ald. Michael Rodriguez of the 22nd Ward, where the demolition took place, said making the details public is critical \"for good governance to work, as well as to help our neighbors and community heal.\"A LARGE SWATH OF REDAfrican Americans are almost three times as likely to die from exposure to pollution, which is a major contributor to heart disease, asthma and premature death, according to the city's 2020 Air Quality &amp; Health Report.\"Air pollution can both increase risk of chronic illnesses like heart and lung diseases and contribute to worse outcomes for people living with certain health conditions,\" says the report, which for the first time analyzed community-level data on air quality, health and social factors to identify which neighborhoods should be prioritized for air pollution reduction and mitigation efforts.The federal Clean Air Act and environmentally friendly and sustainable development practices are credited with improving overall air quality.But Cook County does not meet the federal standard for ozone, and the Chicago area has seen an increasing number of days with high levels of ozone-polluted air.\"Additionally, fine particulate matter pollution remains high in Chicago,\" says the air quality report. \"Although the Chicago area meets federal standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution and levels have fallen by 40% since 2000, concentrations are still among the highest in the nation.\"Particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or smaller can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream and is particularly damaging. \"Our estimates suggest that 5% of premature deaths in Chicago each year can be attributed to exposure to PM2.5,\" the report says.Concentrations of particulate matter and ozone are fairly uniform across the city, according to the report, but pollutants such as diesel particulate matter are more prevalent in areas with significant traffic and industry.A map produced by the city shows a large swath of Chicago's South and West sides shaded in bright red, indicating areas of greatest vulnerability.A similar map by the Natural Resources Defense Council highlights overburdened areas they say should be targeted for \"increased environmental monitoring, enhanced enforcement, and land use and public health reform.\"THE 'TOXIC DONUT' AND 'ASPHALT TRIANGLE'The EPA has stepped up its inspections recently, conducting about 60 in the Chicago area alone since last summer, says agency administrator Shore. The EPA regulates inhalable particles but not those larger than 10 micrometers.\"It's a very high level of attention, which is consistent with our focus on places where cumulative impacts from multiple facilities raise environmental and public health concern,\" Shore says.The area around Altgeld Gardens, a sprawling public housing complex on the Far South Side, has been tagged the \"toxic donut\" because it is encircled by industry. Three asphalt companies form an \"asphalt triangle\" around several Southwest Side neighborhoods.Hazel Johnson, a pioneering environmental activist, coined the term \"toxic donut.\" She founded People for Community Recovery in 1979 to raise awareness and help local residents harmed by pollution. She died in 2011.Her daughter, Cheryl Johnson, has picked up the mantle.\"At the end of the day, these industries are only looking at their profits, not the quality of my life and my health,\" says Johnson, who grew up and still lives in Altgeld Gardens.Residents shouldn't be asked to choose between jobs and good health, says Edith Tovar, who lives in Little Village.\"Poor communities are always being cornered into choosing one or the other,\" says Tovar, an organizer with the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. \"You either have to choose clean air or you have to be OK with a factory or a warehouse being built here.\"It's not a fair choice, she says.WHEN INDUSTRY MOVED NEXT DOOROne day in 2018, Alfredo Romo, who lives in the McKinley Park neighborhood, noticed large industrial tanks being constructed across the street from the namesake 72-acre park. Romo, in remission from a rare form of cancer, later learned that it was MAT Asphalt, which manufactures paving material for street repair and resurfacing under city contracts.Neighbors for Environmental Justice was formed in 2018 to protest the facility, which they say was operating without their input or knowledge. Romo says that the people who experience the noise, traffic and odors want a say in decisions that could affect their environment and health.\"We just couldn't comprehend how a heavy industrial facility was able to get constructed in front of the park, next to schools and 1,000 feet from homes,\" says Romo, the nonprofit's executive director.McKinley Park is a working-class neighborhood that is 54% Latino and in 2021 had a poverty rate of 18.3%.They later learned their neighborhood was deemed an environmental justice community, which meant \"we are already a community overburdened with pollution,\" he says.The group has filed complaints against MAT Asphalt, accusing the company of emitting particulate matter in harmful amounts.\"People are literally waking up to smells in their kitchens, in their backyards and in their basements,\" Romo says.MAT Asphalt was a bidder for the now delayed half-billion-dollar city contract. Cunningham, of the health department, says the city wants to more fully study the matter to avoid overburdening the community.Officials will \"more fully build in, even to our procurement processes, consideration of environment and public health,\" she says. \"There are meaningful and important steps that the city can and is taking to more equitably distribute burdens and reduce burdens overall.\"Michael Tadin Jr., co-owner of MAT Asphalt, says his business is among the most environmentally friendly facilities of its kind, \"yet it has become a scapegoat for the ills of environmental racism.\"The company voluntarily underwent testing, which determined that plant emissions were about one-twentieth of the allowable regulatory limit of hazardous air pollution and less than 1% of the permissible amount of particulate matter, he says.He calls the advocates' criticisms \"mind-boggling.\"The company will rebid for the city contract, Tadin says, and will meet any additional environmental requirements.The Illinois EPA says it takes into account a community's conditions when companies apply for permits and uses a screening tool to determine whether \"the location of the source or project is or would be within an area of (environmental justice) concern,\" says a written response to Crain's questions.It added: \"The Illinois EPA then uses its discretion to inform the public of those permit actions.\"TOXIC METALS IN TOENAILSGina Ramirez's mother grew up near U.S. Steel's former South Works plant and suffered from asthma attacks on poor air quality days. Ramirez was pregnant in 2013 when residents banded together to reduce fugitive dust from stockpiles of petroleum coke, or petcoke, a fine dust byproduct of oil refining.Then she heard that Reserve Management Group was planning to open a metal recycling facility in 2018 in the working-class, largely Latino Southeast Side after it was pressured by the city to close General Iron, RMG's facility in affluent, majority-white Lincoln Park.\"I was going to be raising my son in this neighborhood, and I was like, 'Oh, hell no,' \" she says, citing the company's history of violations and complaints.RMG formed a new company to operate the facility, Southside Recycling, at a cost of over $80 million, including \"best-in-class air pollution control equipment that meets or exceeds all applicable environmental laws,\" the company said.Ramirez helped organize protests to stop it from operating.After an impact assessment, the city health department denied the company a final permit.RMG is appealing the decision\u0097and suing the city.A February statement from the company said the Illinois EPA completed an exhaustive review process, issuing a state air permit, and that experts repeatedly determined that the facility would not pose a public health or environmental threat.\"And the City's own health experts, using intentionally inflated parameters to overstate the effects of the operation, still concluded that the facility poses no risk of adverse health effects above the benchmarks defined by the U.S. EPA,\" the statement said.The company says the health department bowed to political pressure.Health is top of mind for Ramirez, whose 8-year-old son Evan has autism.Evan is enrolled in a health study analyzing exposure to manganese, which can be measured in children's teeth and toenails. Instead of saving Evan's front baby teeth as a childhood memento, she sent them to researchers.A study published last year in the International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health found measurable concentrations of toxic and trace metals in the toenails of a sampling of children with asthma living on the Southeast Side as compared to children with asthma in a demographically similar Chicago community.The children with concentrations of certain metals in their toenails had more asthma complications.\"These data suggest that selected metal exposures may be associated with impaired pulmonary function parameters and reduced asthma control among children with preexisting asthma,\" the study reported.Dr. Victoria Persky, one of the study authors, says more air monitoring is needed, especially at the hyperlocal level, to identify pollution hot spots.\"We know that way beneath the current standards for particulate matter that there are health effects and that the standards need to be changed,'' says Persky, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the UIC School of Public Health.ULTIMATE GOALAdvocates are demanding that fines paid by Hilco Redevelopment Partners be used to install and maintain permanent, publicly accessible air monitoring systems.They also want the city and Hilco to pay for and maintain air filtration systems for homes directly affected and for the health department to complete a new soil study, create a remediation plan and install and maintain permanent air monitoring systems in impacted areas.\"I don't understand to what extent there was supervision and oversight and accountability,\" Rodriguez said in June. \"The city issued 16 citations against the redevelopment company and two subcontractors for $68,000, and those were settled for about a third of that, without having to admit guilt or wrongdoing. Our community still wants to understand why those decisions were made.\"The city has since toughened its rules on demolitions.Hilco did not respond to requests for comment.Johnson, of Altgeld Gardens, says communities of color want to plan for the future, but it's a future that \"depends on how good our air, water and soil is.\"She plans to establish an environmental justice center that will train residents in communities harmed by pollution for green jobs, including how to test air and water quality and remediate lead and asbestos.Tovar, of Little Village, also is looking ahead.The ultimate goal of environmental justice, she says, is to \"rethink what our community can look like and how we can prosper.\"",

  "Title": "Local pols say they're ready to share the spoils",
  "Text": "At first glance, the latest attempt at regional collaboration on economic development in the Chicago area seems like a triumph of hope over experience.That may well be the case. Previous efforts to unite the rivalrous fiefdoms of northeastern Illinois for the betterment of all have fizzled.But that's no reason not to try again, provided goals and expectations reflect on-the-ground realities and prior experience.Unveiled Jan. 4, the Greater Chicagoland Economic Partnership includes the city of Chicago, seven counties making up the metropolitan area and several economic development agencies. It aims to change the zero-sum equation that characterizes much of economic development in our region. In what can charitably be called a \"stretch goal,\" it even includes a promise by members to stop poaching their neighbors' businesses.Wouldn't that be something? Cross-border poaching is a time-honored custom around here. The latter decades of the last century saw mass migration of Chicago companies to suburbia. Tables turned in recent years, as former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel lured a parade of corporate headquarters back to the city.Apparently that's all in the past. Instead of raiding each other, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, along with the bosses of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties, say they're joining forces to foster investment and job creation across the metropolitan area.Proclaiming \"a new era of regional cooperation,\" they promise to promote \"robust, equitable economic growth by building a globally competitive ecosystem that works for everyone, with world-class transportation infrastructure, economic sectors, talent and innovation.\"The initiative suggests local leaders have come to appreciate a couple of important realities of economic development. First, a corporate move from one part of metropolitan Chicago isn't a win for the region as a whole. Second, and more importantly, fragmented, internally competitive economic development efforts among numerous municipalities don't fully capitalize on the combined strengths of greater Chicago.Sales pitches from the city or any individual county fail to capture the full package of assets a company would find in our area. The region has a compelling collection of transportation infrastructure, workforce talent, world-class educational and scientific institutions, and civic and cultural amenities.These assets span multiple jurisdictions, which matter a lot to local elected officials but matter little to business owners deciding where to invest. Our rail and road networks and electricity grid ignore municipal boundaries. Local retailers, restaurateurs and entertainment venues draw customers from across the region. Area employers hire workers from multiple ZIP codes. Similarly, economic problems such as housing affordability, pollution, poverty, aging infrastructure and traffic congestion reverberate throughout the area.Economically, metropolitan Chicago is a single, integrated entity. When new investment comes into the area, everyone benefits. New jobs in Chicago spur housing demand in both the city and suburbs. A new factory in Will County creates job opportunities not only there but in surrounding counties. And when students in one part of the region leave school without job skills, employers in other areas suffer.Yet an integrated, regional approach to economic development has eluded us, even as some other metropolitan areas learned to work together. Backers hope the Greater Chicagoland Economic Partnership will succeed where prior efforts fell short.It's starting out modestly, as a $3 million, three-year pilot project overseen by World Business Chicago, the city's economic development arm, which historically has operated as a de facto subsidiary of the mayor's office. WBC says it will pay more attention to suburbia and hire a few staffers for the project. We'll see if a group run by a mayoral appointee can curb its city-centric tendencies.The partnership hopes to notch some early wins that will attract longer-term corporate funding. Organizers laid out some reasonably achievable, if somewhat vague, initial goals for its pilot period, such as \"150 pro-Chicagoland decisions\" and \"500 shared new investment opportunities.\"How will it work? According to its \"purpose statement,\" the group envisions itself as a forum for collaboration among \"corporate, civic and institutional partners to leverage our combined strengths\" and advance plans to benefit the entire region. It would also work to bring federal and state dollars to the region, serve as a clearinghouse for regional information sharing, and promote communication among various local governments and institutions.It makes sense, on paper. And I'd like to believe the new group will be able to spark the regional collaboration we need. Its success, however, hinges on the willingness of local officials to share opportunities and resist temptation to beggar their neighbors.",

  "Title": "ComEd pact entails $32.5 million in higher rates for city project",
  "Text": "Commonwealth Edison expects to spend $32.5 million to develop the West Side job-training center negotiated as part of the Chicago franchise extension with Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Unlike the $90 million in shareholder cash the utility has committed to seed a new clean-energy nonprofit in Chicago, ComEd will seek to recover the West Side project investment from ratepayers throughout the Chicago area.The deal\u0097which got an icy reception at the Feb. 1 City Council meeting, with an alderman putting a temporary block on the measure\u0097has been billed so far as an initiative that would benefit the city without raising electricity rates.But the fine print shows that about a third of the overall price tag will result in higher rates if ComEd convinces state regulators to approve the spending.ComEd's franchise with the city expired at the end of 2020, and the Lightfoot administration has been negotiating with the utility for more than two years. What's on the table is a 15-year extension of the franchise, which gives ComEd the right to access city streets in order to deliver power to households and businesses.The deal could be extended for five years after that if both sides agree. If it is, ComEd would pump an additional $20 million into the nonprofit.The new West Side facility would be designed to train residents in underprivileged city neighborhoods for utility jobs, most of which are well paid and unionized. The city envisions up to 10,000 workers being prepared for jobs at ComEd or other companies doing clean-energy work.In addition to the $90 million ComEd is promising for the new nonprofit, it's offering $10 million for workforce development once the center is complete. In a Securities &amp; Exchange Commission filing last week, the utility said it may seek recovery of those costs from ratepayers as well.If it does, that would be a total of more than $40 million in rate hikes to cover the commitments Lightfoot has obtained from ComEd.MORE RATE HIKESThe $32.5 million for the West Side project already is included in ComEd's $1.5 billion, four-year rate hike proposal it filed last month with the Illinois Commerce Commission, spokeswoman Shannon Breymaier said in an email.\"We'd recover from all ratepayers (not just those in Chicago) because all ratepayers will benefit from having a well-trained and diverse workforce,\" she added.ComEd did pledge that if it wins approval from the ICC for some or all of that $10 million in spending on job training, it will pump an equal amount of shareholder dollars into the nonprofit, giving that entity more than $90 million already committed. That would ensure that the total commitment in shareholder cash to the agreement with the city would be $100 million.",

  "Title": "A tax idea for the dustbin of history",
  "Text": "It took nearly four decades for Chicago business leaders to squelch the head tax, the job-killing per-employee levy rolled out by Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1974. Now, one of the contenders with a reasonably good shot at making it to the mayoral runoff this spring wants to put this bad idea\u0097and several others\u0097back on the table.As Crain's Greg Hinz reports, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson is touting a bevy of new taxes in his pitch to unseat incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Among them:A surcharge on Metra fares paid by suburban residents that Johnson argues would raise $40 million a year.A $98 million-a-year tax on jet fuel used at Chicago's airports, primarily O'Hare.A \"user fee\" on \"high-end commercial districts frequented by the wealthy, suburbanites, tourists and business travelers.\"And, of course, a $4 per worker per month employee head tax.These ideas aren't coming from some fringe write-in candidate but rather from a man many polls place in the top tier of the nine-person field heading into the Feb. 28 election. Johnson's momentum is being provided in large part by the Chicago Teachers Union, which granted him its endorsement early in the contest and stands ready to throw its get-out-the-vote army and organizing muscle behind his candidacy. Many of the ideas Johnson is touting come straight from the CTU's well-worn playbook.So it's important to take these proposals seriously\u0097and to point out in no uncertain terms how damaging they could be to Chicago's economic health.A Metra tax, at a time when ridership is still depressed and downtown office landlords and tenants are desperate to bring workers back to the Loop? Not smart. As Crain's has reported, the Regional Transportation Authority, Metra's parent, is staring down what it terms \"an existential crisis that neither fare hikes or service cuts can solve.\" The agency warns it faces a $730 million fiscal cliff by 2026 without an infusion of federal and state aid. Boosting ridership will be crucial if the transit system is to avert this crisis, making a suburban rider tax the very last thing Metra needs at this critical moment.A jet fuel tax? It's not clear that's even legal. As Hinz pointed out in his original report, bond agreements at O'Hare generally require that money raised at the airport be used to support airport projects. And a \"use fee\" for shoppers and diners in \"high-end\" neighborhoods such as, presumably, the Magnificent Mile is similarly defective. Even if such a tax could be enforced, one has to wonder: Has Johnson seen North Michigan Avenue lately?As for the head tax, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel's justification for finally putting a stake in it in 2011 was that the revenue it generated didn't offset its job-killing effects. In the 20 years after the head tax was enacted, Chicago by some accounts lost more than 250,000 jobs\u0097a virtual body blow to the city's economy. Restoring such a tax now would only make it that much harder for Chicago and the state to compete for investment.What Chicago needs in its next mayor\u0097whether it's Lightfoot or any of her challengers\u0097is a leader who understands what Chicago business owners, managers and investors are up against, and who values the contributions these people can make not only to Chicago's economic well-being but also to its civic welfare and cultural vibrancy. Chicago has a rich history as a place where business leaders are expected to get behind big public causes such as the creation of Millennium Park and the modernization of O'Hare. It's also a city where business leaders contribute considerably to philanthropic causes\u0097as is only right when those leaders are fortunate enough to do well in a town that creates the conditions for their success.Head taxes and the like, however, do little more than reinforce the notion that Chicago is hostile to business. There's no doubt this city faces enormous challenges, many of which Johnson and other candidates in the field rightly want to solve: a shortage of affordable housing, for one, inequitable distribution of investment from neighborhood to neighborhood, and a need to improve educational outcomes for all residents of the city, not just those lucky enough to make it into magnet schools. But knee-jerk \"soak the rich\" solutions to these ills not only demonstrate a lack of creativity\u0097they undercut the very idea that the people and businesses targeted by these policies could actually help provide the answers to such problems if only they could be seen as partners rather than opponents.",

  "Title": "CEOs confront the hottest hot-button issue of them all",
  "Text": "Forgive CEOs if the first thought that crossed their minds after news of the Supreme Court's draft abortion ruling was, here we go again.In recent years, corporate America has been asked or compelled to respond to one hot-button issue after another. Utility giant Exelon, snackmaker Mondelez, McDonald's, Walgreens and others joined an outpouring of corporate support for same-sex marriage. Last year, Mondelez, Kraft Heinz and United Airlines spoke out against legislation in several states that they saw as unduly restricting the right to vote.As they've shed their traditional reticence on political and social issues, companies have learned that speaking out can trigger a backlash. CEOs have watched with dismay as Disney drew the ire of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis when the company spoke out against his legislation limiting discussion of gender and sexuality in public schools.But those matters, as controversial and stomach-churning as they've been, don't rise to the same emotional temperature as abortion. How will corporations respond if Roe v. Wade is overturned, as five Supreme Court justices were prepared to do as of three months ago?\"I think abortion is the toughest one yet because it evokes the strongest and most widespread emotion,\" says Erik Gordon, professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.Companies and their CEOs may try to avoid taking a public stance for as long as possible. But over the long term, Gordon doesn't think neutrality will be possible. They can expect pressure on both sides of the issue from employees, investors, customers and outside groups.\"I don't think either side (in the abortion battle) is going to let companies off the hook,\" he says. \"There's no place to hide on this one.\"If there's any doubt about that, David Osteen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee, dispels it. He points to the example of Citibank, which has offered to pay traveling expenses for employees in Texas who need to go to another state for an abortion. \"We've already seen some pressure at some companies,\" he says.\"It's very easy to change credit cards,\" he adds. \"They should think long and hard about deeply offending tens and tens of millions of people in this country. And shareholders should take a look, too.\"GLOBAL REACHMcDonald's was one of many companies that either didn't respond to a request for comment or declined to comment.But, because of its widely known brand and global reach, McDonald's is a good example of a large corporation repeatedly caught in the crosshairs of social and international issues not ordinarily associated with business.The Chicago-based company began rolling out initiatives and setting goals for itself after George Floyd's murder sparked calls for corporate diversity reform across America. It tied executive pay to diversity measures and launched a $250 million push to diversify its franchisee ranks. Still, it was hit with lawsuits from Black franchisees alleging discrimination.It didn't stop there. CEO Chris Kempczinski came under fire late last year when text messages he had sent to Mayor Lori Lightfoot came to light. Just as society called for racial justice and understanding, he said in a text that the parents of two children shot and killed in Chicago \"failed those kids.\"UKRAINEThen, in February, after Russia invaded Ukraine, McDonald's took heat for hesitating to shut down its Russian stores. It closed them in early March, but only after customers and investors pressured it to do so.Numerous Chicago-area companies like State Farm and Boeing responded to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by pausing donations to members of Congress who had voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results. But months later, they and most other companies taking that stance resumed donating to those lawmakers.Like it or not, bosses must deftly navigate the divisiveness gripping America. It's now part of the job description for a CEO.Ally Marotti contributed.",

  "Title": "6 HURDLES TO MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORK ON LASALLE STREET",
  "Text": "Can converting office buildings along LaSalle Street to residential spaces address Chicago's affordable housing crisis? Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration thinks so, but some developers and affordable housing experts have doubts. Families, one of the groups most in need of affordable housing, might not find Chicago's financial district an appealing neighborhood. Here are six points that highlight the limitations in converting LaSalle Street to a residential area.1. SCHOOLSThere are no public elementary schools in the Loop. Students who would live on this stretch of LaSalle Street would attend South Loop Elementary, roughly 1\u00bc miles away. By contrast, Austin has over a dozen CPS elementary schools, and Lakeview has nearly 10.2. GROCERY STORESAccess to supermarkets and fresh food is limited. The area is largely served by convenience stores and small grocers.3. PLAYGROUNDS AND GREEN SPACEMaggie Daley Park offers plenty of green space and playgrounds, but it also would be a 15- to 20-minute hike for families looking to take their kids to the playground.4. WINDOWSOpen office plans feature lots of floor space away from windows. That might be fine for rows of cubicles, but converting the space to residences with highly desirable natural lighting would be difficult and expensive.5. MULTIBEDROOM UNITSSimilarly, open office floors tend to get converted into studio or one-bedroom apartments. Creating multibedroom dwellings that appeal to families would be architecturally challenging and costly to add additional plumbing for multiple bathrooms.6. SHOPS AND RESTAURANTSMost current food and entertainment options are geared toward office workers.",

  "Text": "One of the five bidders to own Chicago's casino received some special treatment from the Lightfoot administration: an undisclosed two-for-one deal that saved it $300,000.City sources confirm that, while five different groups submitted bids to own and operate the potentially lucrative facility, only four paid a required $300,000 application fee.The two-for-one deal went to Bally's, which offered separate bids to build the casino\u0097one on truck marshaling yards west of McCormick Place and the other on Chicago Tribune printing plant property at Halsted Street and Chicago Avenue\u0097but only paid the application fee once.Another group which submitted two bids, Chicago casino mogul Neil Bluhm's Rush Street Gaming, had to pay $300,000 for each of them. Those bids aimed to be housed in McCormick Place's Lakeside Center (that bid was rejected) and at Related Midwest's The 78 property south of the Loop.The latter is on Mayor Lori Lightfoot's final shortlist of three finalists, along with Hard Rock's plan to build a gambling complex as part of the One Central development west of Solider Field. Hard Rock paid $300,000 for its single bid.So why were the two double-bidders treated differently?Lightfoot's office is saying only that, while Bally's ownership team would have been the same for each of its proposed locations, Bluhm teamed up with different groups at each location.\"In the case of Bally's, it was the same applicant and same ownership group that was proposing an alternate site,\" said an administration source who asked not to be named. \"In the case of Rush Gaming, there were two different applicants with different ownership groups in each application.\"That's true. At McCormick Place, Rush Street partnered with Farpoint Development, and at The 78 with Related.However, neither Related nor Farpoint is a stranger to City Hall. Farpoint is the lead on developing the old Michael Reese Medical Center property. Related has several projects pending around town and extensive hearings were held before zoning was approved for The 78. Both firms have been extensively vetted by the city before they applied for the casino opportunity.In turn, while Bally's proposed the same ownership structure, there were considerable differences between its proposals.Bally's has an option to buy the Tribune property. It had no such deal at the McCormick Place marshaling yards, which are owned by the agency that operates the convention center and legally controlled by a group including Farpoint. The Tribune property is located in a congested area that needs major road work. The marshaling yards are adjacent to Lake Shore Drive, Metra tracks and the Chicago Transit Authority's Green Line. Both are located near residential areas in which special planning will be needed. The Tribune property is about a half-hour drive from Rivers Casino in Des Plaines. The marshaling yards location is about the same distance from casinos in Hammond and Gary, Ind.The Lightfoot source said the city is using the $300,000 payments \"to support the costs associated with evaluating the various proposals.\"One alderman termed it \"disturbing\" that the Lightfoot administration would require filing fees without notifying the City Council.\"Why was this all kept secret?\" asked Ald. Brian Hopkins, 2nd, who opposes Bally's proposal for the Tribune site near his ward. \"We're trying to build confidence in this process, so why couldn't this be disclosed?\"Hopkins said the city's explanation for the disparate treatment \"doesn't make logical sense.\"\"There were five bids. They each got their own number and their own chapter in the report the city gave us,\" Hopkins said. \"If we're charging by the application, we should charge by the application, not who mailed it.\"Bally's declined to comment, referring the question to Lightfoot's office. Bluhm also declined to comment.The two-for-one deal is only the latest in a series of favors the city has appeared to do for Bally's as Lightfoot nears her decision on which of the three finalists to select.Previously, the city let Bally's, in low-key fashion, drop a clause in its contract with minority investors giving the company the unilateral right to buy out the minorities at a pre-determined price. And it has echoed Bally's argument that Bluhm is conflicted by having another casino nearby, in Des Plaines.Spokesmen for Bluhm have argued it would make no sense for him to invest more than $1 billion in a Chicago casino and then undermine that investment by pushing customers to go elsewhere.Ald. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, whose ward abuts the Tribune printing plant site where Bally's hopes to operate, had this to say in an email to Crain's:\"The City Council was promised a fair, open and transparent process to select a winning bidder for Chicago's casino.\"Essentially, we were promised each of the bidders would be given equal consideration on a level playing field.\"That said, the administration has recently engaged in some serious gymnastics to the exclusive benefit of one finalist: Bally's.\"Waiving application fees that other competitors had to pay? Allowing the buy-out of minority participants after the bid was submitted? Rejecting one bid for being too close to Indiana casinos, while accepting Bally's as a finalist, despite being equidistant to Rivers Casino?\"That just doesn't smell right.\"And it doesn't seem like a level playing field to me. It suggests there has been some preferential treatment afforded to one of the casino bidders, to the detriment of other potential bidders.\"It raises serious questions about the objectivity of this selection process and just how deliberative this process was intended to be, because it sure doesn't feel terribly transparent, objective or deliberative to me.\"",

  "Title": "Another perplexing plot twist in the casino quest",
  "Text": "Much as the Lightfoot administration would prefer that we all move on and celebrate her great victory before electing her to a new term, the questions keep coming about why she was in such a rush to select Bally's to run the city's prized casino.The questions, many of them about apparent favoritism, have circulated for the last year. Now, in recent days, comes another set of questions surrounding when Bally's will be able to move the current tenant out of its River West site \u0097 the Tribune printing plant \u0097 and how much it might have to put on the table to induce such a relocation.The story, broken by my colleague Danny Ecker with a little help from me and a few others here, is that the Chicago Tribune's owner, Alden Global Capital, is holding out for a big, big check in the manner of rapacious hedge funds worldwide. The longer that standoff drags on, the greater the odds that Bally's will not be able to open the gambling palace by its scheduled 2026 date, forcing the city to wait for tax revenue it's counting on to pay off old pension debt, Crain's reported.The response from the city and Bally's is that there's nothing to worry about, that the parties will work something out and that, if need be, Bally's can start construction on other portions of the former Tribune property while the haggling continues. Officials point to, among other things, a clause in Bally's contract with the city that, under certain conditions, appears to require it to compensate the city for up to 85% of tax revenue lost to a late opening.Maybe. This Chicago homeowner would like to see fast action on anything that will keep my property taxes from leaping again.But wishes are not always granted. Are the city's promises of what's to come consistent with the reality of what's actually out there?For instance, one thing the city doesn't talk about is a little-noticed section in its March 2022 report narrowing down the list of casino finalists to five. Here's what that section, on Page 17, said about Bally's control of the River West site: \"Bally's has control of the proposed property through a purchase option agreement. Bally's has indicated that it expects the Tribune Publishing plant will be able to relocate within six to nine months of the Host City Agreement\" between the city and Bally's finalizing the casino deal is signed.That agreement was signed last June. Six to nine months later (eight to be exact), not only is a relocation agreement not in hand, but the unmoved plant remains in place and in full operation, pumping out my morning newspaper. I guess that March 2022 wording is obsolete.A second for-instance: A source close to the matter says the contract between Bally's and Alden has not an eviction, but rather a relocation, clause. To move out the Tribune, the clause says Bally's either has to offer three alternate sites, or come up with some kind of financial buyout. What that means is that Alden has leverage; it can stall and delay and hold out, however much people at City Hall or Bally's headquarters hold their breath until they turn blue.Bally's doesn't want to talk about any of that. Its spokesman flatly declined to comment. Nor is the company willing to produce a copy of the contract with Alden so that the people of Chicago can determine for themselves how big the threat is to a project critical to the city's bottom line. City Hall, meanwhile, is saying only that it's confident things will get resolved between these two parties.So add these questions to a long list of others suggesting that either the city failed to do due diligence on a critical deal, or that it tilted the playing field to Bally's advantage when picking the winner in its casino sweepstakes.Remember the story about how Bally's got a $300,000 gift from the city, as City Hall required it to pay only once for two casino bids but made competitor Neil Bluhm pay $600,000 for his two bids? Or the story about how the city let Bally's quietly change the terms of its bid after submission, dropping a clause that would have allowed it to buy out minority partners whether they wanted to be bought or not? Or the tales about how both the city's casino law firm and its casino revenue consultant also happened to be working for, um, Bally's? Or the fact that the city held just one \"public hearing\" in River West before finalizing its choice of the Tribune property, a hearing in which the public finally got to speak after two hours of a city sales pitch?Then there's chatter about how Bluhm's proposal on The 78 property in the South Loop supposedly was rejected because he didn't control the site, needing a deal with Metra to relocate rail lines and approval from the Army Corps of Engineers. Neither supposed encumbrance holds water, literally, especially in the case of the Corps, which has no apparent authority over a dryland project. But then, maybe the idea of giving Bluhm the prize after he roughed up Lightfoot in a fight over city sportsbooks just didn't sit well with the mayor.I can't tell you how many people who know City Hall well have told me in recent months that the city's stampede to select Bally's just doesn't feel right \u0097 that there are too many loose strings.So, now we have more questions. And more questions. I want to believe it's all hunky dory. I really do. But, sorry, gang. I'm from Chicago.",

  "Title": "What's up with this aldermanic exodus?",
  "Text": "So far, Chicago's once-potent and influential business community mostly has watched as the race for mayor has unfolded. Perhaps that will change as the list of candidates narrows and leaders face the reality of whether Lori Lightfoot has earned another four years in office.Meanwhile, another item that also will be on the city ballot in February has exploded in importance: The question of who will be elected to the City Council at a time when moderates seem to be on the run and budget-busting, police-phobic Democratic Socialists are building power.The dog days of summer brought a flood of aldermanic retirements, some welcome but collectively big enough to raise a real question of whether people who know how to govern and not just issue fiats will be in charge after the votes are counted.The departure list is particularly noticeable along the lakefront\u0097and not just on the North Side, but all the way south to Hyde Park and South Shore. That's the area that long has been ruled by relative moderates, people who believe in social services but realize budgets need to be balanced, folks who favor political and police reform but also value reasonable law enforcement.That was then. What happens next is an open question.COMMONALITIESGoing for sure or already gone are Alds. Harry Osterman, 48th; James Cappleman, 46th; Tom Tunney, 44th; Michele Smith, 43rd; Sophia King, 4th; and Leslie Hairston, 5th. Only three lakefront council members remain: Alds. Brendan Reilly, 42nd, who says he's staying put; Brian Hopkins, 2nd, who's been mulling a race for mayor; and Pat Dowell, 3rd, who in June came up just short in a race for Congress. (More members headed out the door include Alds. Carrie Austin, 34th, indicted last year on bribery charges; Roderick Sawyer, 6th, and Ray Lopez, 15th, both challenging Lightfoot; and George Cardenas, 12th, aiming to join the Cook County Board of Review.)The reasons for the departures vary from person to person. But there are some commonalities.For one, just about everyone on the departure list has been around for a while; in many cases, a long while. New blood is good, but so is experience.Another commonality is that no one in that group gets along very well with Lightfoot at the moment, even though some ranked high on the mayor's City Council team. Like Tunney, who chairs the Zoning Committee and guided through Lightfoot's selection of a River West site for the city's casino, but told the Sun-Times that being an alderman isn't much fun right now.If I was Lightfoot, I'd be a little worried that my lieutenants are jumping ship.BALANCING ACTAnother reason for the exits: Lightfoot's priorities \"do not include downtown or the lakefront,\" says one retiring alderman who asked not to be named. But on issues such as property taxes, casino locations, law enforcement and the like, \"You've got to have a mayor for the whole city.\" Left unsaid is the reality: A mayor needs to find the right balance on issues such as property taxes and police strategy. If they don't, the city as a whole suffers.One top business leader says his group is aware of the particular importance of this cycle of upcoming City Council elections and will play its cards accordingly.The current wave of retirements is \" unprecedented,\" says Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce CEO Jack Lavin. \"A lot of people look at the mayor's race. But we need a core of supporters in the City Council, too.\"Lavin promises money and help are coming to candidates in wards that\u0097perhaps including the 46th\u0097look like they'll have a clear aldermanic choice. \"We're not afraid to get involved,\" Lavin puts it. \"We're putting it together. We'll have more to say soon.\"For the city's sake, I hope so. As I wrote recently, Chicago's post-COVID economic recovery seems to be caught in a one-step-forward, one-step-back cycle, with some good news but also continuing reversals. A dramatic change in City Council control could tilt things beyond repair.",

  "Title": "MHub seeking TIF money to move to Near West Side site",
  "Text": "Advanced manufacturing incubator mHub is poised to move its operations to the industrial corridor west of the Fulton Market District, where it has reached a deal to buy a building\u0097provided it can get some taxpayer help to build it out.The five-year-old nonprofit is under contract to pay more than $32 million for the vacant 80,000-square-foot building at 240 N. Ashland Ave., where it would relocate from the property at 965 W. Chicago Ave. in River West that it has called home since its 2017 launch, according to sources familiar with the deal. MHub is slated to go before the city's Community Development Commission this week as it seeks tax-increment financing money to subsidize its relocation and the build-out of its new space, though details were not immediately available.If the sale is completed, mHub would showcase the wild growth in property values on the Near West Side over the past decade and further establish the area west of Fulton Market as a hotbed of light industrial businesses. The planned manufacturing district\u0097formally dubbed the Kinzie Industrial Corridor\u0097has long been populated by brewers, floral shops, caterers, food wholesalers and other similar ventures operating out of vintage buildings. It is also already home to one manufacturing-focused incubator in the Industrial Council of Nearwest Chicago, which leases out more than 400,000 square feet to industrial entrepreneurs just four blocks west of where mHub plans to plant its flag.MHub, which is framed as a manufacturing-focused version of Chicago tech incubator 1871, stands to raise the neighborhood's profile as major Fulton Market development projects creep toward it. Naperville-based developer Marquette broke ground earlier this year on a new 12-story, 210-unit apartment building one block south of the property mHub is set to buy.MHub's departure from its current home, meanwhile, would highlight River West's ongoing transformation from a historically industrial pocket of the city into a more gentrified one. A series of big apartment projects and a new Bally's casino and entertainment complex are on track to change the complexion of the incubator's current environs.The incubator and Mayor Lori Lightfoot could draw some scrutiny for the use of TIF funds to support the deal, money that is traditionally meant to combat blighted areas.A Lightfoot spokesman did not immediately provide a comment on the proposed TIF subsidy. But the city may highlight mHub's importance as a launching pad for new businesses that want to grow in Chicago, helping reduce the costs and other barriers involved with physical product innovation for early-stage companies.Alumni include Hologram, a communications-hardware startup that raised $65 million last year; NuCurrent, which developed wireless-charging technology; and Sabanto, an autonomous-technology startup in the agriculture space that recently raised $17 million.A spokeswoman for mHub declined to comment.MHub's lease for its current 63,000-square-foot space in River West\u0097a former Gonnella Baking building that was redeveloped by Google as a testing lab for Motorola Mobility in 2013\u0097is due to expire next year, according to sources familiar with the agreement.MHub's purchase of the Ashland building would return the nearly century-old property to its former industrial use. The three-story structure just north of the CTA Green Line Ashland station was built in 1926 and served for years as a machinery manufacturing and distribution facility for the Cameron Can Co.Crain's John Pletz contributed.",

  "Title": "City touts $160M 'social bonds' sale as success",
  "Text": "City officials are claiming success with this month's sale of social bonds that gave city residents first priority and were tailored to capture investors in the environmental, social and governance, or ESG, market.As part of the $1.2 billion Chicago Recovery Plan put together by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and approved by the City Council, the city issued a roughly $160 million bond offering and gave Chicagoans a one-day head start on the right to purchase the bonds ahead of the larger market.According to the city, 8% of the bond offering, or $12 million, went to Chicago retail investors who were able to make investments from a minimum of $1,000 up to $1 million. Illinois residents made up 24%, or $38 million, of the purchases.And $88 million in orders came from \"11 ESG-focused investors,\" following outreach to the ESG market ahead of the offering to learn how to structure what services the city would fund with the bond proceeds.The proceeds will help fund seven projects already approved as part of the $1.2 billion Chicago Recovery Plan, including the construction of 2,000 units of affordable housing, purchasing temporary shelter space for those experiencing homelessness, replacing 200 vehicles in the city's fleet with electric vehicles, making city lots ready for sale, community development projects and the planting of 15,000 trees across the city.The series was sold through the Sales Tax Securitization Corp., a nonprofit entity previously created, and backed, by the city's sales tax in an effort to secure a lower interest rate and which has higher credit ratings than the city itself.Jennie Bennett, the city's chief financial officer, said the \"participation by retail investors on this transaction was the highest\" of any city-backed bond offer \"in at least a decade.\"\"The city is pleased with the success of its inaugural social bond issue,\" she added. \"The city created a unique social bond which allowed Chicagoans to invest in historic investments in their own community.\"\"The city generally sees 0.3% retail participation in its deals,\" according to the city's budget office, which credited a marketing push that included transit and radio ads.Earlier this month, Bennett told Crain's the city would look to offer additional social bonds in later offerings, potentially totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, as part of the $1.2 billion recovery plan.",

  "Title": "In the final weeks, it's a wide-open mayoral race",
  "Text": "With about five weeks to go, the race for mayor of Chicago is absolutely wide open, up for at least five of the nine contenders to capture\u0097or fumble away.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is in trouble, but don't count out the wily and strong-willed incumbent. U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia likely is the current leader, but he needs to quit acting like he's got it won. Close on their heels are former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, businessman Willie Wilson and, perhaps, Ald. Sophia King, 4th.In a nine-person field\u0097and after years of COVID, crime, economic decline and other woes\u0097anyone who says they know how this will turn out is smoking bad weed. If average Chicagoans and big business donors wake up to that reality\u0097so far, my impression is that voters are not really engaged and business remains uncertain\u0097this election will be one for the books.Here's what I see, and what to watch for:Four years ago, if you'll recall, a little-known lawyer named Lori Lightfoot caught a gust of public support when Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, was indicted on federal corruption charges and rumors exploded about the future of Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. Lightfoot's vow to drain the swamp was exactly what voters wanted.Instead, they got a mayor who has excelled in making enemies; someone who, whatever her legitimate claims to have moved Chicago in the direction of racial and economic equity, had to govern in the middle of a pandemic and a resulting crime wave her team has only begun to tame. That has put her solidly on the defense. And though she's used her fundraising to burnish her reputation and go negative on Garcia, he still leads in most recent polls and much of her cash hoard is gone. At least as bad: In lakefront wards like the 44th and 43rd that should be friendly territory, her support is so weak that her appointed 43rd Ward Ald. Timmy Knudsen wouldn't even endorse her at a candidate forum last week.Will someone else join Lightfoot in trying to hobble Garcia? Will any Black candidates drop out? Will King, the only other woman on the ballot, come up short in raising the cash she needs to go on TV? Lightfoot could use some help on those.Garcia has big name recognition but has been running a fairly quiet, cautious campaign so far.That may not be enough. I'm told he's reached out to prominent business figures, but none have gone public yet. And he still has yet to really explain why fallen crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried spent $200,000 on Garcia's political behalf last year, or say whether his informal alliance with Madigan was real.If I were Garcia, I'd be worried about who's coming up on my left. That's Johnson, who has quietly assembled a seven-figure war chest; has substantial precinct help from the same progressive army that elected Delia Ramirez to Congress; and is trying to supplant Garcia as the voice of a new generation of activists who want to squeeze the well-off and privileged until the working class\u0097and the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097are content.Then there's Wilson, whose base is low-income Black voters, but whose politics borrow a few pages from the Book of Trump. And Vallas, who is trying to prove his talents as a former schools chief and his mainstream ideology in a left-leaning city are what Chicago wants.Wilson has been trying to peel off some of Vallas' base in what used to be known as white ethnic wards on the Northwest and Southwest sides. Vallas needs to hold onto those while emphasizing his competence if he's to pull votes elsewhere, especially on the North Side. His acceptance of an endorsement from the Fraternal Order of Police was a big gamble, but Vallas has been much more disciplined than usual this campaign.Out of that morass, Chicago on Feb. 28 will chose two contenders to go to an April runoff. Four years ago, in a larger field, the top vote-getters finished the first round with 17.54% (for Lightfoot) and 16.05% (for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle) of the vote.Like I said: wide open.",

  "Title": "A 'leap of faith' in Auburn Gresham",
  "Text": "The shuttered terra cotta furniture showroom near 79th and Halsted streets had sat vacant for decades. Twenty-five graduating classes at Leo High School next door came and went. The building sat almost unnoticed, a persistent sign of disinvestment in the South Side neighborhood.But Carlos Nelson, CEO of the Greater Auburn-Gresham Development Corp., or GAGDC, got the keys to the building in 2017 after tracking down the owner in Hyde Park and arranging some \"creative financing\" to spur redevelopment. This month Nelson and his team will cut the ribbon on the $20 million Healthy Lifestyle Hub that includes a clinic and pharmacy and will create an estimated 150 jobs.Across the street, developer Torrey Barrett is preparing to build the first of two apartment buildings, part of the city's Invest South/West initiative. Less than a mile south, entrepreneur Erika Allen and her partners are launching an anaerobic digester that will convert food waste to renewable energy and compost for farming. And Metra is starting construction of a $30 million station at 79th Street on the Rock Island Line. Overall more than $130 million is being invested in the beleaguered community.Local leaders hope the activity will attract private capital and ultimately revitalize Auburn Gresham with updated housing, jobs and amenities. \"What if people could walk to work, walk to a coffee shop?\" Nelson says. \"Maybe they're making good money working at the health center or the digester that will enable them to buy a home.\"Even with the kind of money the neighborhood hasn't seen in decades, it will be an uphill climb. Auburn Gresham suffers from population loss, crime and neglect. The commercial corridors are half-vacant. The 79th and Halsted intersection is saddled with shuttered stores\u0097a onetime CVS, Bank of America and Sav A Lot. The neighborhood was dealt a discouraging setback last month with the closing of the Aldi supermarket on Ashland Avenue south of 76th Street.Just because buildings are going up doesn't mean Chicagoans will choose Auburn Gresham over other neighborhoods such as South Shore or Bronzeville.\"Is there a clear vision of what we're trying to achieve?\" asks Victoria Lakes-Battle, Chicago executive director of nonprofit lender IFF, which helped fund the digester project. Community development is like spreading peanut butter, she says, adding, \"If it gets spread too thin, folks don't get enough of what they need to be made whole.\"And while leaders share a vision on what success could look like, they don't always agree on the best tactics of getting there. Residents objected to the city-sponsored housing plan at rancorous meetings last year, with worries about density and a lack of parking, shops and other amenities.But there's no question that things are happening. \"Investors can see cranes and scaffolding,\" says Maurice Cox, the city's commissioner of planning and development. \"We've gotten the private sector interested in an area they simply had no interest in a year or two ago.\"RESIDENTS PUSH BACKNine miles south of downtown, Auburn Gresham prospered in the first half of the 20th century. It was an Irish Catholic and Dutch neighborhood marked by sturdy Arts and Crafts-inspired bungalows and two-flats. The mostly Catholic population was served by five parishes, including St. Leo and St. Sabina.Like other South and West Side neighborhoods, Auburn Gresham saw an exodus of white residents. It flipped from 95% Irish to 95% African American today. The closing of industrial sites and outsourcing of jobs devastated the neighborhood. It and other South and West Side communities languished as the city and private investors lavished attention downtown and in the West Loop.The population fell nearly 20% to 44,878 between 2000 and 2020, while the city's population fell by 5% and the region gained 5%, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Median income is only $34,296, compared with $58,247 for the city, and a quarter of the population is under the federal poverty level, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning.For the five years preceding the pandemic, unemployment of 16% was double the citywide rate of 8%.But Auburn Gresham has assets: About 40% of its housing units are single family and almost 30% are small buildings with two to four units. The Rev. Michael Pfleger put St. Sabina on the map with his fiery social justice advocacy. And lush Auburn Park boasts three lagoons, bridges and walking trails.When Mayor Lori Lightfoot launched the Invest South/West program in 2019 to repair the city's most disenfranchised communities, Auburn Gresham was among the first of three neighborhoods to win projects, along with Austin and Englewood. The Healthy Lifestyle Hub and renewable energy project already were underway.Allen and Nelson had teamed as the Always Growing, Auburn Gresham partners to win the first $10 million Chicago Prize from the Pritzker Traubert Foundation in 2020. Those funds helped complete the hub and enabled GAGDC to provide venture capital to Allen's Green Era environmental digester. About $2 million is being reserved to develop a community education center at the campus.The progress of the health center encouraged the city to issue a request for proposals to develop a city-owned vacant lot directly across 79th Street. While other Invest South/West communities have attracted three to six proposals, only one surfaced for Auburn Gresham. The $19.4 million plan from a venture of the Imagine Group and Evergreen Real Estate, along with Ross Barney and Nia architects, was a five-story mixed-use building. It included 62 affordable apartments, ground-floor retail space and gardens.Imagine Group's Barrett in 2019 developed the Kleo Art Residences in Washington Park, named for his late sister, who was a victim of domestic violence. He plans to bring to Auburn Gresham a version of his supper club in the Kleo Residences.Despite the restaurant, private gardens and other amenities, the community pushed back hard. A lot of the seniors who live on Peoria, Green and Sangamon don't like the project because they worry about congestion and parking, says 25-year resident Lillie Howell. \"Where are the new residents going to shop? All the stores have closed.\"Imagine Evergreen subsequently split the project into two parts: a three-story, 28-unit building at the original site, and a five-story, 30-unit building on a vacant city-owned lot two blocks to the east. That nearly doubled the cost of the project to almost $40 million, including the city's contribution of TIF dollars and tax credits\u0097resources that won't be available for other city projects. \"If this is what it took for the community to believe in it, it's a success story,\" Cox says.Nelson says, \"I tip my cap to the city for listening and making adjustments.\"Not that the project solves all needs. GAGDC would have liked to have seen condos or townhomes to boost homeownership and a push to upgrade vacant or run-down homes to attract buyers. Development of the housing complex on a site that might have been used for clinic parking means the hub has to find a creative solution for parking, possibly shuttling customers to and from their cars.Howell says she's OK with the project going ahead, \"because we need new things in the community and financial stability. But, she adds, \"I want it to be good. I hope and pray there are good residents and they screen and monitor them.\"Adds Lakes-Battle: \"Community engagement is hard, and it's messy. Sometimes there are time pressures. You have to build trust.\"A FUTURE IN CLEAN ENERGY?Auburn Gresham needs jobs, updated housing and amenities. But how does that get done, and in what order?The neighborhood must stem its population decline in order to attract substantial retailers, Cox says. Grocers won't open if people are leaving, and adding apartments is a robust way to grow the population as compared to filling vacant single-family homes, he says. But the city envisions \"infill\" housing and plans to issue a request for proposals to develop row houses on vacant city land near one of the lagoons. \"We can expand housing options for folks who want to live by a body of water,\" Cox adds.Citing the loss of national retailers, Ald. David Moore, 17th, says the city needs to invest in people to run their own stores, adding, \"We don't have to beg people to come to our communities.\" The city has allocated $1.5 million in Neighborhood Opportunity Fund grants to fund eight new and established businesses, including a dentist plus hardware, beauty and coffee shops. And $11.2 million will be used to widen streets and add lighting and benches.The question remains: What is special about Auburn Gresham that would attract singles and young families? Lakes-Battle points to the distinctive Puerto Rican community in Humboldt Park that's anchored by a six-block stretch known as Paseo Boricua, or Puerto Rican Promenade. The entrances are marked by distinctive metal Puerto Rican flags, and the restaurants and grocers offer food from the island.\"You know you're entering a place informed by Puerto Rican culture,\" she says. \"The small businesses are complementary.\"Government can help direct industry to particular neighborhoods that can evolve into industrial or business hubs. The city intentionally recruited business to the West Loop, Lakes-Battle says. The enhanced transit and pedestrian-friendly streetscape complemented the business environment. Similarly, south suburban communities are fashioning themselves as hubs for food and metals manufacturing. Can Auburn Gresham take on an identity as a food-to-energy hub?Erika Allen would like to see that happen. Her career has focused on urban agriculture, and her nonprofit Urban Growers Collective operates eight farms on 11 acres of land, mostly on the South Side.More than 10 years ago, Allen and partner Jason Feldman envisioned a business that would recycle food waste\u0097diverting it from landfills and capturing the methane that contributes to global warming. Digester tanks could convert the waste into gas, and compost could be channeled to urban gardening where soils are depleted. Profits from the business could be used to rebuild the community.The pair found a 9-acre brownfield site in Auburn Gresham that could be purchased from the city for $1 but required a $1.6 million cleanup. It had been owned by International Harvester and its successor company Navistar and later became a city lot for impounded cars.Raising $34 million was a trial. \"I had never talked to so many bankers,\" Allen says. \"That's not part of my experience. If I don't have collateral, I can't get this capital. That puts me so far behind.\"While it was hardly a conventional project, Lakes-Battle saw the appeal. \"With sustainability at the top of everyone's list, we thought it was pretty interesting,\" she says. \"We needed to learn how does it throw off cash to pay us back, create jobs and deliver on its promises?\"By 2020 Allen and her team were able to assemble a $34 million capital stack that included loans from IFF and three other community development financial institutions, New Market Tax Credits and funding through the Chicago Prize. A $2 million state grant was the first under Gov. J.B. Pritzker's Shovel Ready Infrastructure Capital program. State and federal grants supplied funds for the cleanup.Revenue will be generated by acquiring food waste from companies and municipalities\u0097Allen expects McCormick Place to be a customer. The end product, renewable natural gas, will be injected to the Peoples Gas pipeline and traded by BP.Allen also plans other activities for the Green Era campus, including an urban farm, green grocer and education center providing culinary training.Back at the Healthy Lifestyle Hub, workers are adding finishing touches, building out exam rooms for the UI Health clinic. There's office space for Heartland Alliance and Big Brothers Big Sisters. GAGDC is preparing to relocate its headquarters to the fourth floor, offering a panoramic view of the community.The coming years will test whether Auburn Gresham can rise from the ashes. Will these first investments serve as catalysts for additional projects with private capital? Will properties change hands and merchants find a market on 79th Street? Cox says, \"We want to grab people's attention and get them to take a leap of faith with us.\"",

  "Title": "Sheridan's statue should stay, Chicago",
  "Text": "A mayoral committee appointed to pass judgment on Chicago's monuments and memorials has drawn blowback for its recommendation against reinstalling statues of Christopher Columbus that were stowed away after rioters attacked them during protests over the killing of George Floyd in 2020.Less attention has been paid to other monuments on the Chicago Monument Project's hit list, including a statue of Gen. Philip Sheridan that has stood in Lincoln Park since 1923.The committee's report dispatches Sheridan with a few sentences citing his use of \"scorched earth tactics\" to force Native Americans onto reservations, and noting that the statue \"has been the source of adverse public reaction and repeatedly vandalized.\"Setting aside the committee's apparent endorsement of a \"vandal's veto,\" its blinkered assessment of Sheridan ignores his greatest contributions to the country and our city.A son of immigrants who grew up poor in rural Ohio, Sheridan rose to become one of the most important and effective commanders of American forces in the Civil War. With Ulysses Grant and William Sherman, he formed a trio of generals who turned the tide in favor of the Union and bolstered faltering Northern public support for the war. He reeled off a string of key victories before delivering the final blow that forced Robert E. Lee to surrender.TOTAL VICTORYWithout Sheridan's wins and others, war-weary Northerners might have called for a negotiated settlement that sundered the country and allowed slavery to continue for generations. He was instrumental in achieving the total victory that ended slavery and saved the country.As commander of federal troops in Texas after the war, Sheridan ordered the reading in Galveston of a proclamation announcing the liberation of enslaved people on June 19, 1865, an event now celebrated as Juneteenth. He also protected the voting rights of African Americans and gave weapons to Benito Juarez, the Indigenous Mexican patriot fighting to expel French forces from that country.Chicago has its own compelling reason to honor Sheridan. The general's headquarters were here when he commanded U.S. troops in the West during the 1860s and 1870s. When the Chicago Fire broke out in October 1871, Sheridan took charge. He organized the creation of firebreaks to slow the flames. He brought in tents, blankets and food for tens of thousands of residents. And he deployed troops to keep looters and marauders from preying on the stricken populace.That's why Chicago has a Sheridan Road, a Sheridan Park, and yes, a Sheridan statue. Grateful city leaders honored him at a gala dinner when he was named commanding general of the U.S. Army in 1883, praising \"his cool brain, and prompt and ready courage that greatly helped to check the devouring fire,\" and promising that \"Chicago can never forget General Sheridan.\"PARKS CHAMPIONLovers of America's natural beauty also owe a debt to Sheridan, who championed our first national park. He led early expeditions to Yellowstone and lobbied for greater funding and protections against commercialization. He sent troops to expel private businesses that were exploiting the park, ensuring its survival as an unspoiled preserve and a model for future parks.There's no indication that the monuments committee took note of any of these aspects of Sheridan's career. Keen to claim statuary as recompense for historical injustices, the committee judges him solely by his brutal treatment of Native Americans. Sheridan ordered attacks on villages that killed women and children along with warriors. He also encouraged large-scale buffalo hunting that deprived tribes of the food they needed to live outside reservations.These heartless acts belong in a complete picture of Sheridan, alongside his many heroic actions. But the committee isn't interested in a complete picture, preferring the same method it criticizes in monuments it marks for removal: \"Presenting selective, oversimplified, one-sided views of history.\"That distortion discredits the project as an effort to present a more balanced and accurate depiction of the past. Rather than promoting reconciliation, it will foster resentment and division as the public recognizes it as another power play by a favored group recasting history in the light it prefers.Mayor Lori Lightfoot apparently will form another committee to review the recommendations on Sheridan's statue and others tagged for removal. Hopefully that review will consider not only the harm done by the subjects of today's monuments, but also their contributions.In Sheridan's case, the committee should decide if the harm he did to Indigenous Americans offsets the good he did for the country and our city. My answer is no.",

  "Title": "Mayoral hopefuls, watch out for banana peels",
  "Text": "We all make mistakes. Even columnists. We all do things that, in retrospect or at a later time down the road, we wish we'd done differently. The trick is amending, explaining, making up for, changing the subject or otherwise dealing with those errors afterward.We're now entering the stretch run of a mayoral race that's tight as can be, with perhaps five candidates within reachable range of getting into shouting distance of the two-person April runoff. They've all stumbled, to one degree or another. So how are they doing removing their self-strewn banana peels?The answer: It depends on the candidate. And therein you may find out who actually wins.Let's start with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her proposal to extend Commonwealth Edison's franchise as Chicago's electricity distributor for 15 years, with a 5-year additional option.I'll take the mayor at her word that she thinks this is a really good deal, one that will provide $100 million for clean energy initiatives and reliable power for the rest of it. I'll also acknowledge that the mayor's enemies are trying to hurt her by stalling approval of a deal that she'd badly like to get done as soon as possible, and certainly before the April runoff election, if not before.That having been said, this is the ComEd that's in the papers every other day for all the shenanigans it pulled with former Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan, shenanigans that are keeping the U.S. attorney's office here quite busy. Yet, utterly tone deaf to the appearance, Lightfoot not only announced the deal and pushed for a fast vote, but also appeared at a press conference this past week with the company's new CEO, who by all accounts seems to be a good guy but is still running a company that has some reputational damage to repair. And as my colleague Steve Daniels has reported, that excellent deal would drive up your electric bill.It's a bit much to compare this scenario to Richard M. Daley's parking meter deal, as some have done. The parking meter pact literally was signed, sealed and delivered in a matter of days. But it sure is reminiscent of how this mayor handled the upcoming downtown NASCAR race and the Chicago casino deal: steamroll pushes for fast votes, with little\u0097if any\u0097true public input. It makes you just want to sigh.Then, there's candidate Brandon Johnson's decision to tax everything that moves to pay for needed social welfare programs.At Crain's Feb. 1 mayoral forum, Johnson showed signs of backing off his call to impose a tax on Metra rides as a way to squeeze all those rich suburbanites who commute to work in currently half-empty downtown Chicago. Point for him. But when asked if he's not pushing that idea as well as proposed taxes on some shopping districts, jet fuel, transactions on Chicago commodity exchanges, etc., because until very recently he was a paid staffer for the Chicago Teachers Union\u0097which wants all of those levies\u0097Cook County Commissioner Johnson responded with something about Black men needing to hold two jobs to support their families. Right.Candidate Paul Vallas outright ducked at the same forum when asked how he expects to unite a divided, majority-minority city when he sought and got an endorsement from the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police. You know the FOP. It's headed by John Catanzara, the guy who, among other things, loudly defended Jan. 6 rioters and likened Lightfoot's requirement for police officers to be vaccinated against COVID to Adolph Hitler's use of showers in extermination camps. Is that really your message, Mr. Vallas?But one other candidate came close to exorcising a past sin.Asked why he, for many years, chose to effectively partner with Madigan, participating in what amounted to a political d\u00e9tente on the Southwest Side, candidate Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia rather candidly replied that he wanted to get certain things done in Springfield and, to do so, needed the help of the then all-powerful speaker. Just because you swim with sharks doesn't make you one, as the congressman put it.That's about as honest as gets in local politics. Some of Garcia's rivals ought take notes.",

  "Title": "What we need to bounce back from HQ losses",
  "Text": "Having lived through predictions of Chicago's imminent demise before, I'm taking the latest spasm of bad news with a few grains of salt.\"Chicago Blues\" proclaimed the Businessweek headline 22 years ago, adding in the readout, \"It's a great, livable city, but it's fading as a business and financial capital.\"In fact, Chicago not only survived but came back stronger from that period. Just like it survived the \"Beirut on the Lake\" political warfare of the Harold Washington era a few years earlier. But its comeback then was no fluke\u0097and there's no guarantee of a repeat now.The first step toward a comeback is to recognize reality and deal with it. The reality is that though the reasons and impact are different, the Chicago area in the past two months has lost the headquarters of two iconic, category-leading companies, aerospace giant Boeing and construction industry leader Caterpillar. All signs are that it's about to lose a third: hedge fund leader Citadel.That is not good news. It sends a message to other companies and industries around the world that Chicago is, well, some midcontinent nonentity that we can live without. It makes the task of attracting the decision-makers that determine whether an office or factory will locate here or somewhere else that much harder.As my colleague Joe Cahill recalled in a column yesterday, Chicago pulled out of the previous era's blues by getting together with the state and crafting an all-out drive to attract Boeing. It worked. The psychology changed. And for the better part of 20 years, Chicago again was a place that attracted headquarters despite high taxes, a mixed attitude toward business and, more recently, soaring crime.That was then.Boeing departed because Chicago does not fit its need to be close to federal appropriators in Washington. Cat didn't say much, but it has argued in the past that Illinois' tax and regulatory policies hurt its bottom line. As one top business insider who knows the company puts it, in a cultural sense, conservative business CEOs feel more comfortable now in Texas or Florida than they do in liberal Illinois. That means they'll split if they have an excuse to go.That's the case with Citadel. Its boss, Ken Griffin, is most definitely on the conservative side. I hear he refers to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker as \"a Bolshevik.\" But his real issue lately is Chicago street crime and violence, which has made his staff and clients feel uncomfortable and made it more difficult to lure the talent that is critical to Citadel's future.So, he has an excuse. And speculation is rising that if the Griffin-staked Richard Irvin goes down in flames in the June 28 GOP gubernatorial primary, as appears increasingly likely, Griffin will simply pull the plug.Given all that, I'd like to be able to report that city and state leaders are in crisis mode and furiously working to deal with the problem. I can't. Though not everyone is talking about everything, what I'm mostly hearing is a bunch of excuses, explanations and subject-changing. \"Look at all the other good stuff that's happening,\" they're saying. \"We'll be OK.\"That's a loser's answer.For instance, has either the mayor or the governor picked up the phone to call Griffin to ask him what they can do to keep Citadel here? That would be a big ask of Pritzker, who's been the target of tens of millions of dollars of Griffin-funded TV ads. But if you're the leader of the state, you have to represent everybody, including your political foes.Illinois and Chicago certainly have things working in their favor. Like Big Ten new-grad talent. Progressive abortion laws. Or the fact that Lightfoot and Pritzker seem to be working more closely of late on things such as rebuilding Union Station.More, please. Say on a common approach to repositioning rather than losing Ford's huge Torrence Avenue assembly plant to the electric-vehicle era. Or keeping Citadel. Or finally getting a handle on crime.That's a big ask. But big asks are supposed to be Chicago's stock in trade. Are they still?",

  "Title": "Has Chicago lost its HQ appeal?",
  "Text": "The departures of Boeing, Caterpillar and Citadel, along with a stark warning from McDonald's, raise questions about Chicago's continuing appeal as a corporate headquarters town.For generations, metropolitan Chicago has been home to such major companies as Abbott Laboratories, Mondelez International and Walgreens. With 35 Fortune 500 headquarters, it's second only to New York.Headquarters are crucial to the local economy, creating high-paying jobs and putting the city on the map as a global business hub.Chicago still offers companies many things they have traditionally sought in a home base: large numbers of well-educated workers, a relatively affordable housing market, world-class universities, top-shelf cultural and entertainment amenities, and an airport with unmatched global connections.But recent trends suggest the headquarters marketplace is changing in ways that may dilute the drawing power of Chicago's long-standing advantages. For example, sheer size matters less as headquarters themselves get smaller, opening the doors to cities that once lacked the scale to match the massive labor pools in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Smaller locales such as Austin, Texas; Dallas; Miami; and Nashville, Tenn., are now wooing companies away from Chicago and its traditional coastal rivals.\"Chicago's got it all,\" says Tom Stringer, who leads the corporate site-selection practice for consulting firm BDO. \"The problem Chicago, New York and L.A. have is a lot of other cities now have that, too. And you don't need as many people in an HQ as you used to, particularly coming out of COVID.\"Even worse, competition is intensifying at a time when Chicago's negatives\u0097crime, taxes and a perceived hostility to business\u0097are getting the attention of executives around the world.Chicago's future as a headquarters town depends on its ability to adapt to the changing needs of big companies and outclass a growing slate of competitors.So, how does Chicago stack up? To answer the question, Crain's compared Chicago to nine other cities across about a dozen categories, including workforce size and cost, real estate prices, taxes and population growth.We found that Chicago leads just one category\u0097low housing prices\u0097but it's above average in almost all of them.OPERATING COSTSChicago is the fourth-most expensive overall in HQ operating costs, including labor, real estate, electricity, sales and property taxes, according to an analysis by The Boyd Co., a corporate-relocation consultant in Boca Raton, Fla. It's cheaper than New York, Los Angeles and Boston, on par with Washington, D.C., but pricier than Austin, Dallas, Miami, Nashville or Raleigh-Durham, N.C.TALENTChicago has a higher density of management talent than New York, Los Angeles or Dallas. Smaller markets of Boston and Washington have greater concentrations of management workers, but salaries in Chicago are 15% lower and housing costs more than one-third lower.TRAVEL CONNECTIONSChicago is better-positioned than most American cities to meet the travel needs of executives overseeing worldwide operations. Travelers can make more international connections from O'Hare than any other airport, according to research firm OAG. Chicago is enhancing that advantage with an $8.5 billion terminal modernization that will make flight connections easier, among other improvements.O'Hare was one reason that Helsinki-based software maker Sievo chose Chicago over New York and Atlanta for its U.S. headquarters five years ago. \"We can fly in and out to client sites easily,\" says Perttu Paarma, who leads the operation.COST OF LIVING/HOUSINGBecause of the pandemic and remote work, workers have more freedom to choose where they want to live. In a tight labor market, that means employers must pay much closer attention to cost of living and quality of life.\"They're asking: Where should people be located, where do they want to live and work, how can we increase retention?\" says Amy Fobes, a managing director for real estate services firm Savills.When it comes to cost of living, Chicago is more affordable than its coastal counterparts. The cost of living here is 18% above the national average, roughly even with Miami, according to the Center for Regional Economic Competitiveness in Arlington, Va. Boston, Washington and Los Angeles are 55% above average, and New York is 85% higher. Dallas, Austin, Nashville and Raleigh-Durham are in line with the national average.With Chicago lagging well behind the national recovery in home prices, housing costs here are more affordable than in many other areas. Among the 10 cities Crain's evaluated, the Chicago area has the lowest median home value, at $310,000, according to Redfin.GROWTHThat advantage in housing costs reflects a drawback, however. Chicago is barely growing. The population of greater Chicago rose 1.4% between 2010 and 2020, the slowest of the 10 metro areas examined by Crain's. Longtime rival New York grew 6%, while rising star Austin notched the fastest pace in the country at 33%. Dallas, Nashville and Raleigh-Durham each grew at least 20%. A growing population enlarges talent pools, making it easier for companies to recruit workers. And growth itself becomes a selling point for workers who see peers migrating to a city.\"Younger engineers want to be part of a growing city,\" says Mickey Leech, CEO of Schumacher Electric, a manufacturer of battery chargers and other equipment that moved its headquarters from Mount Prospect to Fort Worth, Texas, last year. \"It used to be you graduated from college in the Midwest and wanted to be a 20-year-old living in Chicago. I don't hear that from new kids coming out of college that I recruit.\"CRIMEA focus on quality of life inevitably leads to the question of crime, a distinct disadvantage for Chicago. Although murders in Chicago are trending down, through midyear the city has the highest number of homicides among the cities reviewed by Crain's. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski and Citadel's Ken Griffin both publicly called on local leaders to get crime under control.\"CEOs are extremely reticent to say anything about crime,\" says Aaron Renn, an urban policy researcher who lived in Chicago for two decades. \"The fact that corporate executives in Chicago are talking about crime is significant.\"TAXESAnother challenge is taxes. At 9.5%, Illinois has the highest corporate income tax among peers on Crain's list. Although Illinois' flat personal income tax rate of 4.95% is the lowest among competitors with a personal income tax, Dallas, Austin, Miami and Nashville don't have one.\"The state's flat income tax is one of the few saving graces in the tax code,\" says Janelle Fritts, policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"Cook County certainly makes up for its competitive income tax by combining it with higher sales and property taxes and other assorted fees.\"The Chicago area suffers from relatively high property taxes. The Illinois average is 2.05% of home value, the highest among peers studied by Crain's. Texas is next in line at an average of 1.66%, according to Tax Foundation data. Even New York had a lower statewide average at 1.38%.Lower taxes appeal to experienced workers, says Leech, whose 75-year-old company employs 2,000, most of them in Mexico, as well as about 100 at the new headquarters, distribution and engineering center in Texas.\"Executives want the tax advantage and the warmer climate,\" Leech says.SOME RECENT WINSOne thing Chicago needs right now, according to Leech, is some good news. \"If I were trying to bring businesses in Chicago, I'd want some momentum, a couple flagship wins.\"Chicago has, indeed, notched some high-profile victories. Michigan-based Kellogg, one of the world's top food companies, recently chose Chicago as the headquarters of the $11.4 billion snack business it plans to spin off as an independent company next year. The yet-to-be named company will take its place alongside Mondelez, Kraft Heinz and Conagra, burnishing the city's reputation as a global hub of food and beverage companies.Tech powerhouse Google plans a massive expansion that could total 5,000 jobs when it moves into a renovated Thompson Center in the heart of downtown. Chicago is one of four cities, including New York and Washington, where Google is making a major push to increase diversity with 10,000 new hires. Chicago has the third-largest population of Black professionals, behind New York and Washington, according to Census Bureau data compiled by Smartest Dollar, an insurance researcher in Santa Monica, Calif.FIGHTING THE STORYLINEStill, Chicago battles a persistent narrative of decline, driven in no small part by high-profile corporate defections announced this year. Caterpillar is leaving Deerfield for suburban Dallas, while Boeing ditches Chicago for Arlington, Va., and Griffin takes Citadel from Chicago to Miami. Tyson Foods announced Oct. 5 that it's moving 500 corporate employees from Chicago to its headquarters in Arkansas.In a recent speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, Kempczinski warned that Chicago's deteriorating reputation is making it harder to recruit talent, a key consideration when companies choose a headquarters. And he hinted darkly that McDonald's might someday find a new corporate home.\"It has become increasingly difficult to operate a global business out of the city of Chicago,\" he said. \"Make no mistake . . . McDonald's commitment to Chicago is not corporate altruism. It's not open-ended. It's not unconditional. As a publicly traded company, our shareholders wouldn't tolerate that.\"Mayor Lori Lightfoot responded with a blistering rebuttal, saying Kempczinski should \"educate himself\" before speaking, while her top corporate recruiter released a letter saying 173 companies moved to or expanded in Chicago last year.But observers point out the challenge facing Chicago as it tries to repair its reputation while competing with aggressive marketing by states and cities that are raising their profiles as headquarters destinations.\"The mayor of Miami (Francis Suarez) is relentless,\" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told Crain's during a recent visit to Chicago. \"It's hard to figure out who's the political champion for Chicago. It feels like it's a little lost.\"Michael Fassnacht, CEO of World Business Chicago and the city's chief marketing officer, says Chicago has been aggressive, pointing to Lightfoot's recruiting trip to Mexico City last month.\"There's not one solution,\" he says. \"Do we have to do more work? Absolutely. Is it easy to break through nowadays to change a narrative? No. The mayor's office, the governor's office, the business community and all 10 million people who live in the broader Chicagoland area need to do it. Everyone who has an interest in the success of the city has to tell our story and be advocates.\"",

  "Title": "2023 promises to be even wilder in politics",
  "Text": "After a monumental 2022\u0097the midterm elections, SAFE-T Act controversy, the onset of a brawling mayoral race, living with COVID, et al.\u0097it's hard to imagine that 2023 could top it. Well, buckle your seat belts, folks, because all signs are the new annum will be anything but boring in the world of politics and government.Here are some of the things that will impact your life.In Springfield, now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic Party, it's only a question of when lawmakers will move to ban assault weapons and limit gun magazine sizes, make it easier for out-of-state women to come to Illinois for abortions, and probably draft a proposed amendment to the state constitution to guarantee abortion rights.More fascinating, though, is what's been happening on the business side of things, where potential Democratic presidential hopeful J.B. Pritzker lately has been embellishing his pro-business bona fides, for instance moving to pay off the entire deficit in the state's unemployment trust fund.Pritzker has more work to do and knows it, since the state's job growth still is on the low side compared to other states. So keep a very close eye on whether he gets that proposed \"deal closing\" fund of up to $1 billion he wants through a liberal General Assembly, and whether that and other incentives will be enough to get Stellantis to invest a ton in converting its Belvidere plant to produce electric vehicles. This one really, really counts.Nationally, the race for president already has begun\u0097and in fact began even before the midterms. President Joe Biden now seems inclined to run again, but if he changes his mind, a ton of folks with Illinois connections are interested, including Pritzker and a former Chicago business consultant named Pete Buttigieg, now U.S. secretary of transportation.Even more interesting is what's occurring on the Republican side.Donald Trump now is in as much political trouble as he's ever been, beset not only by prosecutors and congressional probes but major figures in his own party who are beginning to say what's been clear for a while: Much as they love him in rural America (including Illinois), he's toxic in the burbs. It's far too early to write Trump off. But if it becomes clear that, say, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is going to be the GOP nominee, Illinois Republicans finally may have a leader who can help them stanch the bleeding. And pressure on Biden to consider retiring may increase, since Trump likely is the easiest Republican for Biden to beat.Last, but by no means least, you won't have to keep an eye on the struggle for City Hall, because it will bigfoot its way into almost every aspect of life in the metropolitan area. This augurs to be the most significant mayoral election since the Daleys passed the family business to a new generation, with the city's post-COVID economic future very much in the balance.Most of the attention will go to the mayor's race. There, a Lori Lightfoot who has some accomplishments such as increased inner-city investment also has a tendency to make unneeded enemies and is burdened by a crime wave she (and, to be fair, other mayors) just hasn't been able to control. With no giant killer among the field of challengers, Chicago business is uncertain what do. That means anything is possible. How about an April runoff between Willie Wilson and Paul Vallas? Could happen. Or Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia vs. Lightfoot?Equally meaningful are races for the City Council, which has taken a big turn toward the populist left in recent years and soon could go further. A city income tax or a \"LaSalle Street\" tax on financial transactions? Or a much-expanded real estate transfer tax that would hit owners of three-flats and \"rich\" North Side condo owners in the guise of coming up with funds to subsidize development of more affordable housing?Some other hot subjects: Will the Bally's casino glide through or hit bumps with the Illinois Gaming Board? How will local government cope with the end of big federal COVID-relief checks? Will the new downtown NASCAR race be the fiasco some expect?Like I said, quite a year ahead.",

  "Title": "NASCAR race worries Chicago's museums",
  "Text": "Concern is rising fast among Chicago's big downtown museums about the impact of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's planned NASCAR race next Fourth of July weekend on their operations and safety.The city's Sports Commission says in a statement that any concerns will be resolved in upcoming meetings. But it's been weeks since the cultural institutions first met with the city and Chicago Park District to air the issue, and they're still awaiting promised details about which streets will be closed for how long and whether there will be any risk to priceless but fragile objects in the Art Institute from vibrations and loud noises from racing stock cars.Normal museum operations and a weekend of high-speed racing \"are not compatible,\" says Juanita Irizarry, head of Friends of the Parks, an advocacy group which is familiar with the racing concerns. \"This race will detract from the museums and the ability of people to get there.\"Added Irizarry, \"Maybe the city needs to compensate them for their losses.\"FEW DETAILSThe Lightfoot administration has said almost nothing about details of the event since announcing it in July. What is known is that the \"Chicago Street Race\" will occur July 1 and 2; tie up portions of Grant Park for weeks; and require the shutdown of portions of DuSable Lake Shore Drive, Michigan and Columbus avenues, and other streets\u0097at least on racing days.One key detail: Cars will race along East Jackson Drive immediately south of the Art Institute of Chicago, according to a map released by the city as part of its initial announcement. Other portions of the route will affect the ability of drivers and pedestrians to reach the Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium and Field Museum on what for most is one of the busiest weekends of the year.\"We're concerned about our ability to stay on mission, including operating or educational programs,\" says Meghan Curran, chief marketing and experience officer at the Shedd. This is our very busiest period of the year,\" with 10,000 people a day typically visiting in July.Based on what's been disclosed so far, the Shedd estimates it could lose $1.5 million in revenue, Curran said. That's a magnitude larger than the roughly $90,000 the Shedd loses each day during Lollapalooza, which occupies portions of the same area later in the summer, Curran said.\"We're very concerned about any restriction on access for visitors and staff,\" said Bridgette Russell, spokeswoman for the Field Museum. \"This time of year is our busiest season.\"RESEARCHINGKatie Rahn, vice president of marketing and communications at the Art Institute, says it's still researching the noise and vibration issue, and until it learns more, it's unable to reach a firm conclusion.\"We've been in communication with the city,\" she said. \"I know they're working on it. The information is supposed to be coming.\"The commission released a statement saying it, NASCAR and the park district \"are working closely . . . to ensure that the 2023 Chicago Street Race is delivered in a way that minimizes impact on local residents and the surrounding area while creating an experience that all Chicagoans can enjoy.\"The statement added that a traffic management plan \"is in development that will ensure that nearby cultural institutions have sufficient access for their daily operation staff and for all visitors.\" However, the statement provided no details and spokesman Isaac Reichman could not immediately answer which streets will be closed when or indicate whether the cultural institutions will be reimbursed for any financial losses.The city has not disclosed how much it will make from the event for the use of its streets. The park district will get a cut of revenues but has not provided an overall estimate of what it will get beyond the promised $500,000 permit fee.",

  "Title": "How many studies does our police chief need?",
  "Text": "At about the same time that children citywide were wrapping up their trick-or-treating and dipping into their stash of candy on Halloween night, a very different scene was playing out in East Garfield Park.At the intersection of Polk Street and California Avenue, holiday revelers were still making the rounds at around 9 p.m., and a group of neighbors and friends were also gathered to hold a balloon-release vigil for a woman who had died recently. Then, a car drove by. From within, a shooter or shooters sprayed the nearby crowd with bullets. Within about three seconds, 14 people were wounded, including three children age 3, 11 and 13, as the car sped away.Even in a police district known for being one of the most violent in the city, the Halloween night carnage was a jaw-dropping event. Speaking to the Chicago Sun-Times, the local alderman, Jason Ervin, called the shooting \"mind-boggling. . . .It's just a reprehensible act.\"Chicagoans still crave answers to the difficult questions surrounding crime in this city. As Crain's recently reported in our monthly Forum series, some of the crime trends here are actually moving in a positive direction despite the steady stream of negative headlines, and in some ways Chicago overall gets a bad rap for violence\u0097particularly homicides\u0097compared to other major metropolitan areas. Even so, the headline on our report summed it up fairly well: \"All big cities have a violence problem. Chicago's is different.\"Cities around the U.S. have seen a spike in killings over the last couple of years, but Chicago is unique among big cities in a couple of respects. For one, the increase in violence here started before the pandemic. Chicago's homicide rate followed the same ebbs and flows as those of New York and Los Angeles for most of the 20th century, including a steep decline that began in the 1990s and continued into the 2000s, according to an analysis by the University of Chicago Crime Lab. But in the middle of that decade, Chicago's homicide rate leveled off while the others continued to drop\u0097and in 2016, violence in Chicago surged ahead, cementing a statistical break with those coastal peer cities.But Chicago's rise in overall violence compared to peers such as New York City is all about concentration: a spike in violence within communities that were already Chicago's most dangerous. Neighborhoods like East Garfield Park, for instance, where residents feel an increasing sense of hopelessness\u0097and where City Hall's insistence that crime trends are moving in the right direction is hardly comforting.It's no wonder, then, that leaders in these crime-plagued communities want to know more\u0097a lot more\u0097about what Mayor Lori Lightfoot and David Brown, her superintendent of police, intend to do about it.Many were understandably discouraged when, late last month, they learned Brown was commissioning yet another white paper on officer deployment\u0097in other words, how best to make critical decisions about patrol assignments, and where and when to dedicate precious police resources. This news came more than a year after his office had received a similar study conducted by the University of Chicago Crime Lab with Police Department input.As the Chicago Tribune reported, Brown essentially sat on that earlier police deployment study without publicly commenting on it\u0097that is, until his first appearance before the newly formed Community Commission for Police Safety and Accountability on Oct. 24. He told the commission that the Crime Lab study was lacking some elements\u0097so lacking, in fact, that he now finds it necessary to seek yet another study.The commission continues to express concern about Brown's lack of transparency about what, if any, plan exists to decide who does what\u0097and where, and when\u0097within the department.\"We've learned very little that addresses the concerns that we began with,\" as the Tribune quotes commission President Anthony Driver Jr. \"We are deeply concerned that the communities that are suffering the most are still subject to slow response times and inadequate staffing at the times crime and violence occur the most. . . .And we're concerned that communities are routinely being policed by officers who don't know the community, which is bad for residents and police officers.\"So, it's beyond time for Lightfoot and Brown to make the Crime Lab study publicly available\u0097and not in the redacted form supplied to the media following an open records request. And it's also time for Brown to explain why he needs yet another study in order to make decisions about where to deploy the resources at his disposal.Every capable leader treasures data. But data is only valuable if a leader is willing to take the next step: making decisions and taking action based on that data. How many studies does Brown need before he and his boss are ready to make those decisions and take those actions? How much longer must the people of East Garfield Park\u0097and Austin, and Humboldt Park, and Englewood, and Lawndale, and Chatham\u0097have to wait before Brown and Lightfoot can give them the answers they seek?",

  "Title": "What about a second NFL team for Chicago?",
  "Text": "With a move to northwest suburban Arlington Heights possible for the Bears, a question to ponder is whether the Chicago market could support two NFL teams.According to Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report, Chicago is one of most ideal cities to host a new NFL team.\"Chicago is a tremendous sports city and one of the biggest markets in the country,\" Knox wrote. \"The NFL should be eager to double dip into that market if the opportunity presents itself.\"Chicago was once home to two football teams, with the Bears and Chicago Cardinals here from 1920 to 1959.Sports consultant Marc Ganis of Ganis' SportsCorp said that while Chicago is a strong market for two NFL teams, he doesn't think Chicago will ever get another one.Ganis said \"a successful NFL team does not need a big market. Green Bay, New Orleans, Cincinnati, I could go on, but you don't have to have a huge market to be successful.\"There is also the issue of funding football stadiums. He said any time a team has moved or been added, it had its own facility built.\"Every single one of those (expansion cases) has one common front: They all had stadiums that were funded partially or entirely by the government as a precondition,\" he said. Ganis does not think the city of Chicago would fund a new stadium. Crain's has previously reported that Mayor Lori Lightfoot doesn't want taxpayers funding a renovated Soldier Field, though it remains unclear how the city would pay for such a project.Football, with its emphasis on television revenue, differs from basketball and baseball, which need strong local markets to sell tickets, according to Ganis.\"The NFL is less reliant on local markets; 75% of all revenues are shared equally amongst the teams,\" Ganis said. \"In baseball, the teams control all their local broadcasting; in the NFL, the league controls all broadcasting of all games.\" Baseball relies much more on ticket sales, concessions and merchandise.Last year, the NFL finalized new television deals that will make each team more than $300 million over 11 years.University of Chicago economist Allen Sanderson, who conducted a study on Soldier Field and the political and economic motivations around using the field for a private business, said he doesn't see Chicago getting a second NFL team. Television revenue is a huge reason why, he said.\"Because most of the Bears' revenue is not from fannies in the seats in Soldier Field or selling beer. It's a television market, and so that matters,\" Sanderson said.More teams means less money for each one as that revenue is split up, he said.DIFFICULT SITUATIONSanderson, who with others submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the Supreme Court case that resulted in the justices entitling college athletes to receive money from their names, images and likenesses, also said it's important to consider how televising college sports could possibly affect NFL games.Financially, Sanderson said another NFL team wouldn't benefit Chicago much at all and would be more a drain on the city's resources. \"I'm not anti-sports. I'm just trying to be a scientist, take a look at the numbers, the dollars. The local team (doesn't benefit the city) that much,\" he said.There is also the question of whether a prospective second team would want to start in or move to Chicago. Ganis said it's possible that a team would consider Chicago, as it is a good market for football, but \"teams don't leave a difficult situation for another difficult situation,\" in the case of not having a stadium built specifically for them and Chicago being unwilling to do that.He brought up that Los Angeles, the NFL's second-largest market, sat vacant for over 20 years before it got two teams, because they didn't have a stadium deal.\"The idea of a team moving from a less attractive stadium in the urban core to a more attractive suburban location has happened many times. And that does not mean the market has lost the team. That just means it moves to the suburbs, like many other businesses have done over the years.\" Currently, 10 NFL teams play outside of their namesake cities.MORE OPTIONSBefore it became home to the Chicago Bears, Soldier Field hosted a variety of events, from college football games to speeches, something Ganis and Sanderson believe it should return to.\"It should go back to being more of a public space, public events kind of facility. It doesn't have to be for a major NFL team. Rather, it can be used for lots of other purposes,\" Ganis said.This summer, Lightfoot proposed a plan to put a dome over Soldier Field in an effort to keep the Bears in the city.If they plan to move, the Bears would have to buy out their lease or stay at Soldier Field until the lease ends in 2033. During the proposal event, Lightfoot hinted at the idea of Chicago having two NFL teams if the Bears chose to move to Arlington Heights.The Bears have entered into a $197.2 million purchase agreement to buy Arlington International Racecourse. The team is set to unveil plans for the 326-acre property next week.As far as an NFL expansion, Sanderson said there are many things to consider. \"I think that one has to think about if the NFL is going to have 36 teams, you don't just think about Arlington Heights by itself. You say where are the next four (going to be placed)? We're gonna have to think of those four as a batch; that's where politics come into play.\"",

  "Title": "Lightfoot puts $500,000 into reproductive health care",
  "Text": "In response to the news that the U.S. Supreme Court may soon overturn Roe v. Wade, the Chicago Department of Public Health is spending $500,000 on expanding access to reproductive health care, with the funds available for Illinois as well as out-of-state residents.The funds, coming from CDPH's fiscal year 2022 budget, will be used to pay for doctor's visits and abortion services in Chicago, as well as other costs associated with receiving care, including transportation and lodging, said Mayor Lori Lightfoot.CDPH's 2022 budget is more than $1 billion, of which $64 million comes from the city's corporate fund, which is where the $500,000 is coming from. Lightfoot said she aims to increase the amount of designated reproductive care funds in next year's budget.Lightfoot said she aims to create a \"safe haven\" for those denied reproductive rights elsewhere in the country. \"Chicago will be an island of freedom for reproductive rights.\"RESTRICTIONS EXPECTEDIf the Supreme Court overturns the law, about half the states are expected to tightly restrict access to an abortion, including nearby Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio, many of which have Republican leaders who have already taken steps to do so. Lightfoot said May 9 that since news of the possibility of Roe being overturned surfaced, Chicago has already seen an influx of patients seeking reproductive care.Planned Parenthood of Illinois is expecting to receive more than double its normal amount of patients, the organization's CEO, Jennifer Welch, said May 9.The new funding builds on other services the city offers, Dr. Allison Arwady said at the press conference. Chicago's school-based reproductive health program, which provides sexual education, STI and STD screening, and other services, served more than 8,000 students in 2021.\"As a department, we believe in access, education and empowering people's choices,\" Arwady said.Across Illinois health care providers, about 46,000 abortions were performed in 2020, the most recent data available, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health. Of those patients, more than 9,500 were women from out of state, up from about 7,500 in 2019 and 2,000 in 2015.",

  "Title": "Boeing's moves matter, then and now",
  "Text": "Coming and going, Boeing leaves a mark.When the aerospace manufacturer moved to Chicago 20 years ago, it signaled the city's re-emergence as a corporate hub. The previous decade had seen a wave of companies abandon Chicago. Headquarters of giants such as Amoco and Ameritech disappeared. BusinessWeek magazine chronicled the defections in an infamous cover story labeled \"Chicago Blues.\"The story infuriated then-Mayor Richard M. Daley. So he and civic leaders played to win when Chicago was thrust into a national competition for the Boeing headquarters. Win they did, besting finalists Denver and Dallas for the prize.It's hard to overstate the boost Chicago got from that victory. Landing the headquarters put Chicago back on the economic map in a big way. Suddenly, the world became aware of our advantages\u0097a deep talent pool, top-flight educational and cultural institutions, worldwide air travel connections, stunning architecture and lakefront vistas.And the timing couldn't have been better. Boeing arrived at a time when Chicago needed a high-profile endorsement and lots of companies around the country and the world were rethinking their headquarters needs.A string of corporate headquarters moves to Chicago followed. In the next two decades, big names like ADM, Conagra and Caterpillar arrived from out of town. McDonald's, Mondelez, Kraft Heinz and others left suburban campuses for a burgeoning greater downtown.MORE THAN JOBSCritics often complain that Boeing itself brought relatively few jobs for the tens of millions in subsidies state and city leaders shelled out. And it's true that the Boeing corporate headquarters only employed a few hundred.But the parade of companies that came in Boeing's wake boosted that total many times over. Eventually, companies were moving here without getting a dime of taxpayer money.The main benefit of Boeing's move was reputational. It's hard to put a price on it, but the value is undeniable.And the reputational impact of Boeing's decision to leave town is equally undeniable. News broke May 8 that the company is moving its headquarters to suburban Washington, D.C.And the timing couldn't be worse. Boeing's exit comes as Chicago's reputation has plummeted to lows we haven't seen since the 1970s. The city and state have become known globally for uncontrolled crime, surging taxes, corruption and fiscal disarray. Downtown office buildings that drew new tenants in the last two decades haven't been able to reverse the exodus of workers during the pandemic, and Loop landlords are handing the keys to lenders.The defection of a global giant underscores all those negatives. Boeing's reasons for leaving tarnish the city in other ways. Among other motivations, it's looking to tap the D.C. area's concentration of tech talent, raising doubts about Chicago's ability to supply enough of those workers to meet the needs of a company on the cutting edge of many technologies. It was particularly painful to learn that Boeing plans to establish a research hub likely to create a lot of high-paying jobs in Northern Virginia. Wouldn't it have been nice to get those jobs here?TURNING POINT?In the years ahead, Boeing's departure may come to be seen as a critical turning point for Chicago and Illinois. Perhaps observers will regard it as the point at which we went into an inexorable decline.But it doesn't have to be that kind of turning point. It could be a wake-up call that galvanizes our leaders to address Chicago's problems head-on with the kind of concerted effort that Daley organized to bring Boeing to town all those years ago.We haven't seen that kind of leadership from Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who hasn't shown an ability to build broad coalitions. Others in city leadership and the corporate elite haven't displayed much talent in that area, either. They need to put aside narrow agendas and show the world Chicago still works for business.Boeing's move is also a black eye for Lightfoot's economic development team. World Business Chicago appears to have been blindsided by the news\u0097not a good look for the agency that worked so effectively to win Boeing's headquarters in 2001. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and his staff seem to have been caught similarly unawares.If our leaders can't do better, expect more companies to follow Boeing's lead again.",

  "Title": "NASCAR says downtown race worth $113.8 million",
  "Text": "Organizers of the proposed NASCAR race in Grant Park next summer are contending the event will generate $113.8 million in new spending here.And, lifting the veil a bit on an event that Mayor Lori Lightfoot has been slow to provide much detail on, a spokesman for the event says the park will reopen for public use by the time the July Fourth holiday arrives.But the racing combine still isn't disclosing whether it's paying the city a fee for use of DuSable Lake Shore Drive and other thoroughfares, or how long the drive is expected to be closed.The study was prepared by CSL, a Minneapolis-based sports consulting firm that NASCAR says has done similar economic-impact research for the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Rams and other teams.According to CSL, the two-day \"Chicago Street Race\" event will generate $113.8 million in direct and indirect spending, creating the equivalent of 850 full-time jobs and producing $8.9 million in tax revenue to the city, state and county.The study does use a multiplier\u0097a factor intended to measure the impact of direct spending as it gets spent again by recipients\u0097of as much as 20 for some categories of spending. That's \"very high,\" says University of Chicago economics professor Allen Sanderson, whose specialties include sports finance. Such studies almost always inflate the real value of an event, added Sanderson, who has not yet reviewed the CSL study.PROJECTIONSOn the other hand, the $113.8 million NASCAR economic-impact figure is in the same ballpark as the $305 million that a different consultant said the longer and well-established Lollapalooza festival is worth. But that study was done after the music festival, not before.A NASCAR spokesman said the CSL projections are based on attendance of 100,000, with an estimated blended ticket price of $420 per ticket per day. NASCAR itself will spend roughly $50 million setting up and running the event, will fill an estimated 24,000 room-nights in area hotels, and used standard multipliers in coming up with the $113.8 million figure, the spokesman said.The race will \"showcase so many of the amazing things Chicago has to offer,\" NASCAR Chicago Street Course President Julie Giese said in a separate interview. \"Then add NBC and (an) international broadcast\u0097it's a really good formula to continue to showcase NASCAR and what we're doing, but also what the city of Chicago can do.\"The spokesman said \"the vast majority\" of Grant Park will remain open to the public until full-fledged race setup begins June 28. The races will occur July 1 and 2, and any areas that are closed will reopen \"before\" July 4.Neither the spokesman nor Lightfoot's office is saying whether the city is receiving a payment for use of its roads, akin to the funds the Chicago Park District is getting for use of its land, or whether nearby museums will be compensated for the loss of patronage on a busy holiday weekend.\"At this point, many of these figures are not yet fully known and depend on yet-to-occur impacts of running the race itself,\" the spokesman said. \"We expect to have updates on this information following the event.\"Some area aldermen have complained that they've been given too little information and that NASCAR may not be paying enough to the city to compensate residents for the disruption the race will cause.Danny Ecker contributed.",

  "Title": "We're at a disadvantage for the federal cash grab",
  "Text": "As the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a onetime executive at consulting giant McKinsey's first office here, Pete Buttigieg comes as close as anyone to qualifying as an honorary Chicagoan. And in a recent conversation with Crain's political columnist Greg Hinz, the U.S. transportation secretary made it clear Chicago is still on his mind as he ponders what to do with roughly $1 trillion in new spending under President Joe Biden's freshly passed infrastructure plan.Chicago is well positioned to receive funds under two huge pots of money contained in the Biden plan, Buttigieg said, but the city, and more broadly, the region will have to compete against other parts of the country and tailor proposals intelligently in order to win those much-needed funds.The good news in that statement is the recognition that the Chicago area has long been and is poised to continue to be a critical transportation hub for the nation and even the world. The bad news: Regional coordination will be key to success in the steeplechase for federal funding and, to put it in the mildest possible terms, coordination isn't something we're particularly good at around here.Within Illinois' balkanized system of government, local transportation agencies compete against one another for resources. As Hinz reported in the wake of his March 28 interview with Buttigieg and U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Naperville, each entity is vying for a slice of the $2.9 billion the feds will award by year's end, polishing up and preparing to pitch the projects they care about most.Reliable sources tell Hinz the local contenders could include reconstruction of North DuSable Lake Shore Drive, extension of the Chicago Transit Authority's Blue Line to Mannheim Road as part of reconstruction of the Eisenhower Expressway (I-290), completion of the partially funded 75th Street rail grade-separation project, and renovation of Union Station as well as the addition of a new Metra stop in the booming Fulton Market District.All of these proposals have features the Transportation Department might look upon favorably. For instance, the Drive rebuild would add park and beach space, presenting a buffer against erosion as climate change raises lake levels. It also could dedicate a part of the roadway to bus-only lanes.\"I can see a lot of Chicago projects that will do well,\" Buttigieg told Hinz. \"The ones that do the best will be those that espouse policy positions we have posted,\" including promoting safety and racial equity, spurring economic development and helping regions deal with climate change.The equity piece of the puzzle in particular is one that deserves careful consideration. The March edition of Crain's monthly Equity series underscored the point that Chicago's existing transit infrastructure reinforces racial inequities by leaving South and West Side residents at a disadvantage to more affluent neighborhoods where access to job centers, shopping and health care is a relative breeze. And it's easy to see how, in a scrambled scrum for federal funding, solutions to that historic problem could be overlooked.As it is now, there's no one person or agency within the city, the county or the state that has ultimate say-so over which projects to present to the feds for support. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning is, at least on paper, supposed to be the pivot point for that kind of decision-making but, unfortunately, it has little leverage to bring disparate agencies to the table to strategize and prioritize.The danger is, as a result, the Chicago area could either miss out on opportunities to build intelligently for the long-term future or, perhaps worse, find itself building things that won't solve the area's future traffic, environmental and economic challenges.The deadline to apply for that first slug of funding is May 23\u0097lightning speed by federal standards. That means there's little time for dithering. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Gov. J.B. Pritzker should use their respective bully pulpits to bring transit chiefs throughout the region to CMAP's table to draw up plans that can benefit the entire region, not just individual fiefdoms.",

  "Title": "INVEST SOUTH/WEST REMAINS MOSTLY A VISION",
  "Text": "When developer A.J. Patton surveys the empty storefronts, vacant lots and crumbling facades lining a 3-mile stretch of Chicago Avenue between Humboldt Park and Austin, where nearly a third of residents live below the poverty line, he sees a nascent showcase for Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u0092s signature initiative to spur investment in blighted South and West Side neighborhoods.It starts with a proposed $27.1 million mixed-use complex with 44 apartments at Chicago and Central Park avenues, one of several projects induced\u0097and heavily subsidized\u0097by Invest South/West. Then there\u0092s the $39 million, 60-unit apartment building with a grocery store Patton seeks to build five blocks west of there. Farther west, a prominent Austin developer plans a 20-unit condo project with a vegan restaurant on the ground floor, while other developers expect to begin work by the end of the year on a $40 million project that will put new commercial space in the landmark Laramie Bank building and build mixed-income apartments next door.Though none of those projects have won final city approval or broken ground, \"that's arguably $130 million of (planned) investment in a section of the city that hadn't seen it in 40 years,\" says Patton, CEO of 548 Capital, one of the most active developers in the city's poorest communities over the past couple of years. \"That is game-changing.\"Patton's optimism is the prevailing sentiment among neighborhood-focused developers nearly three years after Lightfoot launched what she called her \"Marshall Plan\" for investment-starved South and West Side corridors. Prompted by city-solicited bids, housing and commercial projects totaling almost $500 million in costs\u0097most of which is slated to come from public funding and incentives\u0097are moving through various city approvals, some in areas that have gone decades without meaningful investment. Neighborhood developers say Lightfoot's strategy of directing $750 million in public money and resources into targeted, vacancy-ridden commercial districts differs sharply from the lip service those areas got from previous city administrations, which focused mainly on downtown.Yet so far, the initiative is short on tangible results. None of the city-spurred projects in the Invest South/West corridors has put shovels in the ground, well behind the goal set more than two years ago by the city's planning head to have the first few buildings fully financed and under construction within 18 months. The slow pace raises big questions about Invest South/West's effectiveness and ability to generate the broader, long-term ripple effects that Lightfoot hopes for.OTHER CONCERNSSome developers and neighborhood residents also worry any projects that actually get built will only add to the list of developments that rely on public funding for life support while failing to reverse depopulation trends that have driven away a long list of national retailers. Whole Foods' April announcement that it would close its Englewood store\u0097even as the city commits millions of dollars to an Invest South/West site on the same block\u0097illustrated the persistence of long-standing problems plaguing the neighborhoods Lightfoot hopes to revitalize.\"Some real planning took place, and (the program) has drawn attention to these underinvested neighborhoods,\" says Rachel Weber, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois Chicago. \"The concern is that we're going to end up with (several) Whole Foods\" that require ongoing public funding, \"and as soon as that support is withdrawn or it's clear that is not forthcoming to other developers, that will be the end.\"Still, city officials have earmarked hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars for the effort, hoping to lure private investors and philanthropic groups to help restore economic health to once-vibrant blocks. But with construction work yet to begin on a single Invest South/West project, residents may not see Lightfoot's initiative as an improvement on past city efforts\u0097potentially a key factor in how much voter support the mayor can muster as she seeks re-election in February.Most investors and real estate developers say it's too soon to fairly judge the impact of Invest South/West, which is meant to overturn decades of disinvestment. The COVID-19 pandemic has also slowed the process of gathering community feedback on projects, and rising construction costs and inflation have made it even harder to finance them.Evaluating the program is also difficult because Lightfoot hasn't laid out specific economic growth targets for her massive outlay of public funds. She never said how many jobs Invest South/West should create, how much private investment it should induce, how many housing units or new businesses it should spawn, or how long it should take to produce any such gains.During a ceremonial groundbreaking last month for a $43 million pair of affordable housing projects near 79th and Halsted streets in Auburn Gresham\u0097ceremonial only, since the developers are still in the process of obtaining permits to begin work\u0097Lightfoot boasted that by the end of this year, there will have been $2 billion in combined public and private investment commitments across the 10 Invest South/West neighborhoods since the initiative began. But that figure includes private projects like a $50 million redevelopment of old Humboldt Park warehouses backed by billionaire Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto and a $100 million Northwestern Medicine outpatient facility in Bronzeville that may have moved forward regardless of the city's Invest South/West effort.The city-solicited Invest South/West projects are also almost entirely backed by public subsidies rather than private investment. Nearly 40% of the Auburn Gresham project is due to be funded with tax-increment financing dollars, for example, while grants and proceeds from low-income housing tax credits account for much of the rest, according to a planning department report. A planning department spokesman says public assistance\u0097from the city and other taxpayer sources\u0097accounts for at least three-quarters of the funds backing Invest South/West projects, noting that ratio is in line with other publicly subsidized mixed-use projects around the city.Other markers of Invest South/West's impact, such as economic growth in neighborhoods the city is targeting, don't tell a clear story: In Austin, the number of small-business loans doled out and the value of residential real estate in the area surrounding the Laramie Bank building hit five-year highs in 2021, according to data from Mastercard's Center for Inclusive Growth, which uses a mix of proprietary and publicly available data to track the economic health of U.S. census tracts. Yet Austin overall lost 1,100 jobs between 2019 and 2021, according to Illinois Department of Employment Security data.SPENDING DOWNIDES data shows employment has been steady in Auburn Gresham. But Mastercard's hyperlocal data shows spending in the neighborhood's environs last year fell to its lowest mark since at least 2017.Neighborhood-focused real estate investors credit Invest South/West with boosting Black-owned developers and construction firms that rarely get larger downtown work. Bigger-name developers including Related Midwest and Farpoint Development have also taken on Invest South/West projects, something planning officials hope will spark more private investment in the neighborhoods. But several developers that declined to speak on the record for fear of political retribution say they have explored Invest South/West projects solely to score political points, not to make money.Chicago Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox, who leads Invest South/West, says the 41 bids submitted for the first 11 city-solicited sites proves developers will take on projects in blighted corridors if the city provides various financial incentives and dedicates more staff from multiple departments to shepherd them forward. He also notes Patton's Chicago Avenue project and a $31 million mixed-income housing project in Englewood proposed by veteran community developer DL3 Realty weren't selected for city-solicited Invest South/West sites, but were hatched during that bidding process and are now seeking city approvals.\"Most developers would tell you that if it were not for the city's menu of financial incentives, these deals would simply not happen,\" Cox says.Projects have also benefited from factors entirely separate from Invest South/West. The Neighborhood Opportunity Bonus program\u0097a Rahm Emanuel creation that pooled fees from downtown development projects and redirected them into the South and West sides\u0097has funded small businesses that are populating storefronts in some Invest South/West corridors.RELIEF FUNDSEven the pandemic, a brutal setback for many neighborhoods, armed the city with federal relief money for development grants. Lightfoot recently announced a $13.5 million grant for Cleveland-based retailer Yellow Banana to revive a half-dozen South and West Side Save A Lot stores, including one just steps from the Auburn Gresham project.The city's spotlight alone on neighborhood investment has given local businesses a noticeable boost, says Elizabeth Lockhart, whose family has run a series of small businesses in Austin for the past 45 years and owns 18 properties there today, most of them along Chicago Avenue.Plans to redevelop the Laramie Bank building\u0097where her family had accounts before Citizens National Bank shut down in 1991\u0097are helping Lockhart raise money for a 20-unit senior housing project she wants to develop four blocks east.\"It makes it easier to go to the bank. The bank supports you differently (when the city is investing in the neighborhood), and funding has always been an issue, especially in our community,\" Lockhart says.But Invest South/West has also revealed how difficult it is to build consensus in a neighborhood about what development it needs, and the order of priorities. Winning bidders for the Auburn Gresham site encountered so much resistance from residents who wanted more commercial development and less density that the developers redrew their plans and spread them across two properties.The pushback highlighted the glacial pace at which even modest development projects come together when they require multiple public subsidies, an array of financial partners, months of community review and approvals from several governmental bodies before they can begin moving dirt.Brian Goldberg, whose Chicago-based LG Group is making its first foray into the South Side as co-developer of a $20 million residential building in Bronzeville, praises Invest South/West for helping spark new projects that might not otherwise move forward.Yet more than a year after planning officials selected his firm for the project, he says he is still awaiting city approval for the subsidies needed to move forward.\"I hope if we do get approved, they can figure out how to accelerate the (zoning) process,\" he says. \"The easier they make it, the faster they'll get (projects) out of the ground, and the more developers will follow.\"",

  "Title": "Remap gives Lightfoot a real chance to lead",
  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot has pretty much stayed out of the way as various aldermanic factions have brawled this winter and spring over whose version of the ward remap to implement. She's had good reason. After all, Lightfoot's support in the City Council is iffy in the best of times, so why make yourself a target for both sides by placing yourself in the middle of a food fight?That having been said, if you really want to fill that big office on the fifth floor of City Hall, sometimes you have to do your own dirty work.Such a moment now has arrived for Lightfoot. She by every indication is about to ask Chicago to elect her to a new term. She also may be the only single person who can force at least a partial compromise on the remap. To do that, though, she'll have to gamble that the risk of failing is outweighed by the plus of acting like a leader who can unify the city. Will she?As you may have heard by now, there are currently are two sets of maps formally on the table. One, called the Chicago United plan, has the support of all but one of the City Council's current Black aldermen, plus a fair number of white aldermen from the North and Northwest sides. The other, the People's Coalition map, is backed by all but one of the council's Latino aldermen, with a smattering of support from other groups. Neither plan has the 41 votes needed to avoid a referendum.There still is a chance the two sides could sit down and work out a deal, thereby avoiding a June 28 referendum in which voters would select between the two maps. As I reported April 18, the two sides have resumed peace talks. However, those talks are at best an uphill slog. Though something could change at the last minute, they appear likely to fail. Which would mean that the two maps go to voters.Unless, that is, a third map makes it through to voters. That's where things get interesting. And it should all be decided by the end of a showdown City Council meeting this Wednesday, the last council session scheduled before the referendum ballot will close.The third map comes from Latinos and a coalition of do-good reform groups, including Change Illinois. This map is a variation of the People's Coalition map, but a new-and-improved one. If presented to voters, it could well pass in a referendum since it would have backing from not only the Latino coalition but also the reform groups, which have some sway on the North and Northwest sides.The problem is that the other side, backers of the Chicago United map, know that. So, using a legal loophole, they've refused to put anyone's map to a vote in the City Council. Without such a vote, only the two original maps can go to voters under Illinois' amazingly arcane and complex election law. But if at least 26 aldermen voted for, say, the Chicago United Map, any 10 aldermen could then file the revised Latino/reformer map, placing it on the referendum ballot, too.That's what should happen. If they're going to vote, Chicagoans deserve a real choice between the final proposal from each side. They shouldn't have to vote on a defective preliminary version and a Chicago United map that's inadequate.If Lightfoot gets involved, that could happen. Mayors, when they want, can be pretty persuasive. The mayor wouldn't have to take a side, thereby limiting her risk. Instead, having run as a reformer who would upgrade Chicago's governmental ethics, she could push a few aldermen to allow a council vote, clearing the way for the Latino/reformer map to make the referendum.That's the kind of move that citywide leader would make. We'll see if she does.",

  "Title": "Let's shine more light on the ComEd deal",
  "Text": "Sometimes the right thing happens for less-than-pure reasons.The Chicago City Council's move to block Mayor Lori Lightfoot's hurry-up-and-pass-it push for a 15-year deal with Commonwealth Edison is a case in point.The mayor made it abundantly clear she wanted to get aldermen to sign off on her plan to make ComEd Chicago's electricity distributor for as much as 20 years as quickly as possible\u0097certainly before the April runoff election, if not sooner. The deal, however, received an icy reception from the City Council when it was introduced Feb. 1. Ald. Andre Vasquez, 40th, put a temporary block on the deal, sending it back down to the Rules Committee, which will then ship it back to yet another committee for further review. While Vasquez was first to act via this parliamentary maneuver, he was far from alone in desiring more than a handful of days to study a contract that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars for ComEd.The power agreement with ComEd wouldn't be the first thing Lightfoot has tried to ram through the City Council without much transparency or public input\u0097the NASCAR deal and even the casino deal spring to mind. This time, however, aldermen pushed back. Some had their own political reasons for doing so\u0097this mayor has her share of critics within the council chambers, not to mention more than one challenger for her job. And, of course, the temporary block could benefit aldermen who tell Crain's they would otherwise support the deal but are reluctant to approve a hefty ComEd contract with a corruption trial involving ComEd's former CEO and lobbyists for the company set to begin in March. The mayor may not evince much concern about the optics, but some of her City Hall colleagues do. Again\u0097not the purest reason for seeking a delay, but for Chicagoans who care about government accountability, it will have to do.Whatever the reason for the delay, time and scrutiny are what the ComEd franchise agreement merits. For instance: Within hours of the franchise agreement coming to light, Crain's Steve Daniels reported on fine print that shows ComEd expects to spend $32.5 million to develop a West Side job-training center negotiated as part of the Chicago franchise extension with Lightfoot. ComEd will seek to recover the West Side project investment from ratepayers throughout the Chicago area\u0097this despite the fact that the franchise agreement has been billed so far as an initiative that would benefit the city without raising electricity rates. What other details will emerge in the fullness of time?Chicagoans deserve to have a much deeper understanding of how the franchise agreement will work and who will benefit. Taking the mayor at her word that this is the very best deal the city could manage is simply not enough reassurance\u0097and Chicagoans shouldn't even be asked to make that leap of faith, given the history of backroom dealing at ComEd and this mayor's own pattern of attempting to steamroll over opposition wherever she encounters it.To be fair, the mayor may not have had as much leverage in her negotiations with ComEd as many of her opponents seem to think. City Hall finally released details on the request for information from would-be bidders for the franchise, and Crain's found no power-industry heavyweights elsewhere in the U.S. responding, making ComEd pretty much the only game in town. The agreement she put before aldermen also contains some sweeteners that, at least on the surface, sound promising: $90 million in shareholder cash from ComEd to promote clean-energy development in the city, for one thing.But that's where the kudos for the mayor end. That clean-energy fund could easily be squandered without proper oversight. And the deal as currently written doesn't offer much guidance about that, beyond noting that meetings of the fund's yet-to-be-formed oversight board would be subject to the Open Meetings Act. ComEd itself would get to pick two of the five board appointees.The clean-energy fund ought to be headed by an unconnected, unbeholden expert who will keep it on the rails and ensure the cash isn't merely distributed to connected cronies. Chicagoans deserve reassurances that City Hall and ComEd are committed to transparent, efficient, accountable and equitable delivery of power to the city of Chicago and that all projects related to this agreement will be run above-board.",

  "Title": "Chicago bets on the wrong casino sites",
  "Text": "The outpouring of opposition to the three proposed sites for a Chicago casino may sound like typical NIMBY sentiment, but it underscores other problems with the final candidates chosen by Mayor Lori Lightfoot's casino team.Each location appears to have serious shortcomings when it comes to delivering the greatest possible benefits from a long-awaited city casino.In the short run, Lightfoot is eager to get a casino up and running, in order to start collecting a projected $200 million a year in gambling taxes for the city's woefully underfunded employee pension plans. And it's a safe bet that a casino located pretty much anywhere in the general vicinity of downtown Chicago would draw enough gamblers to generate sizable tax revenues in short order.But that's not the full measure of success for a city casino. A real winner would be a net economic plus for Chicago and the region as a whole. It would expand the pie, rather than carving out another slice for city tax coffers.That means bringing in new money from outside metropolitan Chicago, dollars that wouldn't otherwise be spent here. Unfortunately, the history of legalized gambling in Illinois shows that it's mostly a local market. Illinois casinos are filled with Illinois gamblers.Sure, some folks drive across the border from neighboring states to place bets in Illinois. Maybe a glitzy city casino would lure a few more Hoosiers and cheeseheads. But Indiana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri all have plenty of casinos, limiting the potential market of day-trippers.The risk is that Chicago's casino will merely siphon spending away from existing Illinois gambling sites and other recreational opportunities in and around the city. Baseball fans might opt to spend an afternoon betting for (or against) the Cubs at the casino, rather than cheering (or booing) them at Wrigley Field. Couples might spend date nights at the roulette wheel, rather than taking in a show at the Chicago Theatre.Picking the best spot for a Chicago casino can reduce that risk of economic cannibalization. The ideal location would maximize the amount of money pulled in from out-of-town visitors while minimizing inconvenience to local residents.The gambling mecca of Las Vegas offers some clues to what makes a good casino location. Chicago will never rival Las Vegas as a gambling destination, but it can apply some of the principles that draw gamblers to Sin City from around the world.Las Vegas casinos are concentrated along the famed Strip, which is also packed with hotels, restaurants and everything else visitors need. What you won't find on the Strip is a lot of homes\u0097most Las Vegas residents live in other parts of town, away from the tourist hordes.In choosing a casino location, Chicago likewise should look to areas that already attract tourists and business travelers. A casino would be most successful in close proximity to restaurants, hotels, theaters, shopping and other amenities.The ideal location also would have good transportation infrastructure to handle casino traffic, and relatively few nearby residents whose lives would be disrupted.Unfortunately, none of the three finalists Lightfoot has chosen fit the bill particularly well. None are anywhere near Chicago's main tourist hub on Michigan Avenue, likely owing to the difficulty of finding a large enough site there. All have triggered vehement opposition from local aldermen based on backlash from residents who don't want to live in a gambling district.The apparent front-runner, Bally's proposal for the Chicago Tribune printing plant site at Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street, is more than a mile from Michigan Avenue in a congested area where streets can barely handle current traffic levels.A proposal from Neil Bluhm and Related Midwest would put the casino in a planned high-density residential development south of downtown. Hard Rock chose a site across from Soldier Field in the largely residential South Loop, and its proposal is tied to a larger development that won't go forward without $6.5 billion in state backing that Gov. J.B. Pritzker seems disinclined to provide.For reasons that haven't been adequately explained, the city rejected proposals to put a casino in or adjacent to McCormick Place's underutilized Lakeside Center, near a cluster of hotels and restaurants serving the convention trade. A casino in that area would be well positioned to tap an existing pool of out-of-town dollars among conventioneers, with less disruption for residents.Maybe Lightfoot should reconsider the rejects.",

  "Title": "Who's behind these new publications?",
  "Text": "Chicagoans in search of reliable political coverage in today's fractured media environment have a new source this campaign season. But whether that source is news or recycled propaganda from a prominent political activist is most debatable. As are the actions of the big donor who's apparently picking up the tab.At issue is the recent appearance in mailboxes all around town of Chicago City Wire, a broadsheet publication that bills itself just below its nameplate as \"Real data. Real News.\"In fact, articles in recent editions of the newspaper mostly are negative pieces about Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, mixed with a little positive coverage of GOP gubernatorial nominee Darren Bailey.For instance, one article, under the headline \"More failure at Chicago Public Schools,\" depicts declining school enrollment, with a big picture of the mayor and governor. Another article blames dropping test scores on \"Pritzker('s) school lockdowns\" during the COVID pandemic.Particularly striking in one issue are two pages of mug shots of people accused of violent crimes who may be released without bail under terms of a criminal justice reform bill Pritzker signed into law. At least 25 of the 36 men pictured are Black.The headline on another article, accompanied by pictures of the mayor and governor: \"Lightfoot's 'summer of joy' one of murder, mayhem.\"If that line sounds familiar, it's almost verbatim the language used in an anti-Pritzker TV ad produced and aired by conservative activist Dan Proft's People Who Play By the Rules PAC.That's the same ad Lightfoot recently declared \"racist\" for allegedly darkening her skin color, something Proft denied while standing by the ad.COORDINATED EFFORTS?Proft's group and the Bailey campaign have together received more than $30 million so far this campaign cycle from conservative megadonor Dick Uihlein. There is no proof the two are coordinating their efforts\u0097something that might legally require financial disclosure reports\u0097but the money certainly will not help Pritzker's re-election bid.GOP insiders say they believe Uihlein is paying for the faux newspapers. Full-color papers like these can cost as much as 50 cents each to print and mail. There's no indication that the publishers sought subscribers for these publications.Chicago City Wire is a product of another Proft group, Local Government Information Services, or LGIS. Some articles are bylined \"LGIS News Service.\"Proft did not respond to requests for comment on the effort, which also includes a website with a network of similar sites that have operated around the state for several years. In a 2017 editorial on the Chicago City Wire website, in which he likened the flap over \"fake news\" to \"the verbal equivalent of a white flag on the battle ground of ideas,\" Proft said he is \"a principal of Local Government Information Services, which owns this publication.\"'PAY TO PLAY'The New York Times took a look at such \"pay to play\" publications nationally in 2020. It said many are overseen by Proft business partner Brian Timpone, also an Illinois conservative activist, using freelance reporters to turn out similar right-leaning stories around the state. Indeed, the same bylines that appear in Chicago City Wire also appear in the DuPage Policy Journal, Galesburg Reporter and other publications that appear with Chicago City Wire on the same website.Crain's detailed the initial growth of such publications, in the suburbs, in a 2016 story.What should voters make of that?\"Disguising certain types of political communications as news is a troubling trend (since) many readers probably can't tell the difference,\" says Alisa Kaplan, executive director of Reform for Illinois, a political watchdog group.While the Pritzker campaign, too, used digital ads that look like real news, the ultimate source is disclosed therein, she said. \"People also should know who's paying to try to influence them and why. If the publishers have nothing to hide, why not be more up-front about their contributors?\"Concluded Kaplan, \"The difference between propaganda and legitimate political speech is often in the eye of the beholder. The hope is that readers learn to be aware of what they're reading and who's behind it.\"Crain's reporter Corli Jay contributed.",

  "Title": "KITCHEN CONFIDENCE",
  "Text": "A lot is going on inside the old Cupid Candies factory in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood. Chocolate mixers are whirling and cans of evaporated milk are stacked knee-high. One worker is unwrapping brick-size sticks of butter, and someone is giving a decades-old piece of equipment the \"old Fonzie nudge.\"The most exciting part for Stephanie Hart isn't the candy: It is the construction. The nearly 70-year-old facility is on its way to a second life, and Hart is giving it breath.Hart, the owner of Brown Sugar Bakery, bought the factory in late 2020 to expand her cake-making operation, which had outgrown its storefront on 75th Street on Chicago's South Side. Hart took on the candy-making, too, to expand her business and keep some longtime workers employed.\"This is going to, at minimum, (quadruple) my capacity to make cake,\" Hart said, standing behind trays of chocolate turtles. \"My hope is I'll be able to grow to meet that capacity.\"Hart calls this stage \"escaping mom and pop\" as she takes her business to the next level. Brown Sugar launched online sales in 2021 and now ships its famous caramel cakes nationwide. It's key to building wealth and paying her employees sustainable wages \u0097 and it was more than 20 years in the making.Hart is among a growing number of Black entrepreneurs in Chicago's food and hospitality industry, and across the country, who are positioning their businesses for growth. They say it's time to move beyond the kitchen and mostly menial restaurant and food service jobs, a stigma they're working to erase as they seek increased economic mobility. And they are taking advantage of capital opportunities that opened up after public outcry over the murder of George Floyd in 2020 exposed the depth of the racial wealth gap.Recently, for example, Uber Eats announced the launch of an investment program that will provide growth capital to Black restaurant owners. Community development organization Local Initiatives Support Corp. will administer the new Black Restaurant Fund.Chef Erick Williams of Virtue Restaurant &amp; Bar in Hyde Park, who last year won a coveted James Beard Award, built on that success and recently opened two more restaurants. Food Network regular Dominique Leach is launching retail products out of her Pullman barbecue restaurant, Lexington Betty Smoke House. A new generation of Black hospitality professionals is in training at establishments like Bronzeville Winery. But such successes have been hard won, and owners tell stories of the inequity they have weathered \u0097 and still do endure.\"I always knew I had to run faster, jump higher, be better and humble at the same time,\" says Hart, who didn't get her first traditional loan until 2021, coming 19 years after she launched Brown Sugar. She mused recently on that experience as she made the 10-minute drive between her candy factory and bakery. \"I don't know if people should have to want it that bad.\"TIES TO THE FOOD INDUSTRYBlack Chicagoans have long been integral to the city's restaurant and food industry. As migrants streaming from the South to Chicago by the thousands in the years following the Civil War and during the Great Migration, many found work in restaurants and other areas of the food industry.The new residents brought with them a rich food culture, but segregation and discriminatory practices kept them from gaining a foothold in Chicago's culinary economy. Employers took advantage of Black workers in service jobs, and a stigma developed. The line between service and servitude became too thin.While restaurant ownership remained largely elusive, some Black food entrepreneurs developed a culinary culture around Southern-style cooking, establishing well-known franchises like Lem's Bar-B-Q and Harold's Chicken, both of which started in the 1950s and continue today.In Illinois, 9% of restaurants are Black owned, according to 2017 data from the National Restaurant Association, the most recent available. The state's Black population was 14.7%, according to a 2021 U.S. Census Bureau estimate. Food industry experts say the numbers are likely even more out of proportion in Chicago, where 29.2% of residents are Black and where most of the state's restaurants are located. The lack of data is a concern. If the issue isn't measured, how can it be fixed? Those numbers also fail to capture restaurants that closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which studies show hit Black-owned businesses harder than white-owned firms.The roots of the problem reach through the many levels of discrimination in the American economy, particularly in lending markets, experts say. The fact that Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the country has made matters worse. Restaurants are inherently risky businesses, with low margins and high failure rates. Many traditional lenders avoid backing such businesses anywhere, let alone in neighborhoods that have suffered long-term disinvestment. The U.S. Small Business Administration puts it in stark terms: Minority-owned businesses are more likely to be denied credit, less likely to receive the full credit amount requested and more likely to be discouraged from applying for credit. As a result, securing a loan to capitalize a restaurant can be nearly impossible for Black entrepreneurs.\"You do it yourself, and it makes it that much harder,\" says Baron Waller, a Culver's franchisee who used his life savings to open his first location in 2011. \"That's part of the wealth gap. Most of us have to do it ourselves.\"Waller knows he's an outlier in that regard. But he has also received grants, found partners and tapped into city funding to open additional locations. By the end of this year, he'll have 10 restaurants.Borrowing money got a little easier after he had a couple of years under his belt at the first location, he says.THE FUNDING FACTORWhile some equity is needed to secure a loan, the racial wealth gap illustrates how much less a Black borrower might have compared to a white borrower. As of last June, Black families had 25 cents for every dollar of white family wealth, according to the Federal Reserve.Historical discrimination in labor markets means Black workers are often paid less, said Isaac Hacamo, associate professor of finance at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business. And segregation in housing markets means residents in Black communities likely have lower-valued homes, or do not own a home at all. Homeownership is the standard way Americans build wealth.\"To borrow money, you need to have a little skin in the game,\" Hacamo said. \"Historically, minorities \u0097 Blacks, Hispanics \u0097 always came in with a lot less wealth.\"To start a restaurant, entrepreneurs typically borrow money via loans from traditional lenders, raise money from family and friends, or seek equity financing from investors. Black entrepreneurs typically have less access to all three methods than their white counterparts.Brookings Institution reports illustrate the vicious cycle. In 2019, the banked and underbanked rates were highest for Black adults, making it more difficult to accumulate wealth and pushing them toward alternative lenders like payday loans. Such predatory loans had an average interest rate of 391% that year, compared to 10.3% for the average personal loan from a commercial bank. Relying on such high-interest loans can hurt credit, which makes it harder to get a traditional loan. Black people had the lowest average credit score by race in 2021, at 677. Scores range from 300 to 850. The average credit score was 745 for Asian Americans and 734 for white people.\"In the Black community, we're not just born into understanding what an 800 credit score is,\" said Cecilia Cuff, co-owner of Bronzeville Winery. \"We don't have Roth IRAs, we don't have retirement funds; that's not something we were taught. We're working within our own community to change that, but we're not there yet because it's hundreds of years of disinvestment.\"Cuff and business partner Eric Williams (unrelated to Virtue's Erick Williams) went to 20 lenders trying to raise capital to open their business and were told \"no\" each time, she says.The gantlet of denial was perplexing for Cuff. She had spent a decade opening Hyatt hotels and resorts and owns another restaurant in New Mexico. Eric Williams has owned The Silver Room art and retail space in Hyde Park since 1997. That experience should have counted for more, she says.Eventually, the duo won a $250,000 grant from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Invest South/West program. That gave them momentum to open Bronzeville Winery for $1 million. They brought on investors and were approved for a loan through a BMO Harris Bank initiative that launched in 2020 and relaxes credit standards to better provide access to capital in communities of color.In the restaurant sector, in particular, banks need to be intentional and focus on purpose when assessing loan applications, says Eric Smith, vice chairman at BMO Harris. Banks might view restaurants as risky, but Bronzeville Winery is one of the only fine-dining spots in Bronzeville, a historic district known as a hub for Black business and culture.\"Banks have to recognize the important role that small businesses play in our local community and be willing to make that sort of bet,\" Smith says.GOING BEYOND FOODBronzeville Winery is doing more than just feeding people. It launched a program that teaches employees and community members about bank accounts, credit scores and business wellness. It also includes a 20% gratuity on checks, to ensure employees have stability.There are also development programs for workers. Bussers can be trained to become managers, and dishwashers can work their way up to sous chef. The restaurant also pays for skill-set training, like a sommelier class or a collegiate-level vegan cooking class. Cuff estimates she's spent four times more on training at Bronzeville Winery than she has at her previous ventures. But this is how the restaurant industry becomes more diverse, she says.Already, she's had one employee work his way up from being a dishwasher to a line cook, a move that allowed him to come off governmental aid.\"You'll never get over the finish line if you don't have a base to build on,\" she says.At Virtue in Hyde Park, owner Erick Williams also focuses on hiring minority employees whose resumes aren't as robust as other restaurant employers might want. He has line cooks who were once dishwashers in food halls, and workers leading the line who previously couldn't tell a chive from a sprig of thyme.\"We are trying our best to open the door as wide as we can,\" says Erick Williams.It's a big investment, one that most restaurants aren't willing to make. But training employees gives them a vested interest in the community and industry, which could eventually translate to ownership, he added. Locating in the South Side was a similarly measured decision.\"You can't un-feel the fact that a Black server took care of you while Black music is playing and you're eating Black food in an environment that can compete with any of the restaurants of our scale of any culture,\" he says. \"It's a way of advocacy.\"It's a proof of concept, and people recognize it's working. Erick Williams won the James Beard Award for Best Chef in the Great Lakes region last year. He now owns four restaurants.His path to restaurant ownership was long and unconventional. He grew up among working-class families in the Lawndale and Austin neighborhoods and started working at restaurants as a means to an end. He ended up falling in love with it. He landed at MK Restaurant in River North and worked there for 18\u00bd years, becoming the longest-standing chef at the now-defunct restaurant.Throughout those long years in the kitchen \u0097 unconventional for most restaurant owners \u0097 he built relationships with patrons and their children, many of whom would later become investors in Virtue, which opened in 2018.\"That gives me a level of access or a level of resources that I wouldn't have necessarily gotten from my direct community,\" Erick Williams says.There are two food industries in this country, says Leach, owner of Lexington Betty Smoke House. There's the Black food industry and the food industry.Leach trained at Michelin-starred Spiaggia, under Chef Tony Mantuano. But she's not so sure customers would seek out Italian food from a Black chef. She launched Lexington Betty \u0097 named after her grandmother, who was from Lexington, Miss. \u0097 as a food truck that she financed herself. Her goal was to win over the Black community first, then expand from there.\"It's hard enough to get the attention of the Black community, but to be seen as a Black chef and small-business owner outside the Black community, you gotta stand up straight, you gotta be thorough, you gotta make sure you're crispy clean,\" she says. \"But, most of all, you have to be confident in yourself.\"Now Leach is using her Pullman restaurant to launch wagyu beef products that will be sold online and in Mariano's locations, and she sees big possibilities. The situation is changing for Black restaurant owners, she said recently, as she prepared to head to Canada to film her third Food Network show.\"There was a time when we were willing to play the game by the rules that were already put in place, but we are done with that,\" she says. \"We are done with the validation that we thought we needed, and we're just ready to put our stamp on the world.\"",

  "Title": "Chicago health department braces for a budget crisis",
  "Text": "The Chicago Department of Public Health faces a financial reckoning as COVID-19 ebbs and federal pandemic relief funding that accounted for \u00adnearly 80% of its 2022 budget fades away over the next three years.About $775 million in COVID assistance from Washington helped quintuple the agency\u0092s 2022 budget to more than $1 billion from $177 million in 2019, according to city budget records and CDPH. Much of the funding was provided in the form of temporary grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the $30.5 billion American Rescue Plan and the $2.2  trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief &amp; Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act.The flood of cash allowed CDPH to grow staff by about 50% to 800 employees, many of whom were brought on to lead the city during the worst public health crisis in a century, and develop other infrastructure and programs to support public health initiatives in the future.\"This is the first time I've ever had the resources to actually do what is needed for the whole host of public health issues that we deal with,\" says CDPH Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady.Now those resources are at risk as a stalemate in Congress pushes future COVID funding to the back burner and federal grants expire each year. Hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding could vanish, forcing CDPH to slash operations if it can't replace at least some of that money. Deep cuts at CDPH could result in job losses and the elimination of services, leaving the city less prepared for future pandemics and other health emergencies.\"We have already started pulling back just a little bit to make sure we have some cushion\" Arwady says, adding that CDPH will see some funding cuts as soon as this fall.Even before the pandemic, CDPH's budget was mostly made up of grants. Just $64 million of CDPH's 2022 budget came from the city's corporate fund, city budgets show. But that's up from $36 million in 2019.\"We were woefully small for the third-largest city in the country with the complexity of public health challenges that we had pre-pandemic,\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a March 10 editorial board meeting with Crain's. Houston, which has a comparable population to Chicago, had a $56 million budget for its health department in 2019, according to city records. Meanwhile, New York City's Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene had a budget of $1.6 billion.Asked how the city plans to address any future CDPH budget shortfalls, a representative from Lightfoot's budget office said details are unavailable because the 2023 budget process hasn't started yet.Justin Marlowe, a professor at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy, says, \"The way that these grant dollars are being spent does set the stage for some serious debates and probably some really serious budget reprioritization going forward because (CDPH is) definitely building capacity that's going to require ongoing spending.\"During the pandemic, CDPH invested in up-to-date data and technology infrastructure and expanded laboratory capacity in partnership with Rush University Medical Center.Arwady also launched a wastewater surveillance program that's been instrumental in tracking community spread of COVID-19 but also could be useful in tracking other diseases, like influenza, H1N1, polio and norovirus.\"Wastewater gives you a comprehensive measure for an entire community when you would otherwise have to rely on testing,\" says Charlie Catlett, a senior research scientist at the Discovery Partners Institute, which manages the water surveillance program in partnership with CDPH. But the program is in jeopardy because it's fully supported by a $2.14 million CDC grant expiring in October 2023.'CHRONIC UNDERFUNDING'Public health officials across the U.S. have long complained that the grant model leaves departments underfunded and unprepared for health crises. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention's funding for public health preparedness had been cut in half over the decade before COVID, according to a 2020 Trust for America's Health report. Two years ago, less than 3% of the country's $3.6 trillion in annual health care spending was directed to public health and disease prevention.Part of the problem stems from intermittent cycles of temporary grant funding during public health emergencies\u0097like the 9/11, H1N1 and Ebola crises\u0097which dries up as soon as emergencies subside, says former CDPH Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita, who is now executive vice president at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a health care-focused philanthropic organization in Princeton, N.J.\"Core public health functions that are necessary to sustain are really hard to do when the funding is sporadic,\" Morita says.Morita argues that the U.S. response to COVID-19 could have been stronger if local health departments already had the tools, manpower and laboratory infrastructure to address a public health crisis.\"The pandemic revealed the cracks in the system because of this chronic underfunding,\" she adds.There appears to be public support for increasing funding for health departments. A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll last year showed that 71% of respondents favor \"substantially\" increasing federal spending for public health programs.There are also signs of hope that the current presidential administration is interested in better funding public health. While President Joe Biden's Build Back Better is now at a standstill, it called for $7 billion to support public health infrastructure at state and local health departments.\"All that suggests that there are some changes afoot and that it won't be as difficult for the public health community to come back and make their case in the future,\" Marlowe says. \"But public health people have been saying this for years\u0097someday there's going to be a pandemic and you'll see that you need us.\"",

  "Title": "Tower owner hit with massive foreclosure lawsuit",
  "Text": "The owner of a LaSalle Street office tower that lost its biggest tenant early in the COVID-19 pandemic is facing one of the largest foreclosure lawsuits involving a downtown office building since the public health crisis began.A venture of New York-based AmTrust Realty defaulted on its loan tied to the 983,000-square-foot office building at 30 N. LaSalle St. by failing to make its August payment on its $165 million mortgage, according to a foreclosure complaint filed earlier this month in Cook County Circuit Court.The lawsuit, which lists at least $186 million in principal, interest and other fees owed, was filed by an entity led by New York-based American General Life Insurance. The subsidiary of New York-based AIG issued the largest piece of the mortgage when AmTrust bought the tower in 2014, according to the lawsuit and Cook County records.The complaint highlights the historic wave of financial pain for properties along the vacancy-ridden thoroughfare, where the rise of remote work and weakened office demand during the pandemic devastated landlords that were already grappling with an exodus of big banking tenants before it started.Companies cutting back on workspace have pushed downtown office vacancy to a record high, sapping property values and leaving many investors with buildings that are now worth less than the debt tied to them. Rapidly rising interest rates this year have made it even harder for owners to refinance their properties, prompting a number of downtown landlords to face foreclosure lawsuits or surrender their properties to lenders without a fight.DEPARTUREAmTrust was already facing an uphill climb in 2019 when the city of Chicago said it would vacate more than 260,000 square feet at 30 N. LaSalle as part of a consolidation of some of its downtown offices across the street at 2 N. LaSalle St. That departure left the building at roughly 62% leased as of last year, according to real estate information company CoStar Group, well below the 79% average for downtown offices. The 43-story tower is about 50% leased today, according to CoStar.AmTrust signaled its intention to revive the building a year ago when it announced plans to spend $100 million renovating several of its downtown office buildings to help compete for new tenants. A source familiar with 30 N. LaSalle said AmTrust began part of that work this year by building out move-in ready office spaces, or so-called spec suites.But with lots of empty space, high interest rates and precarious office demand, it's likely AmTrust is underwater, meaning the tower is now worth less than the balance of its loan. The foreclosure filing by American General Life Insurance is a step toward seizing the property if it can't reach an agreement with AmTrust to modify terms of its loan.A spokesman for AmTrust did not provide a comment on the lawsuit. A Cook County judge Nov. 30 appointed Hilco Real Estate Vice President Mitch Vannemin as the receiver to oversee the property while the foreclosure complaint proceeds, court records show.AmTrust took out the 2014 loan to finance its nearly $238 million acquisition of the building at 30 N. LaSalle. The tower was 86% leased at the time.AmTrust tried to exit the Chicago office market entirely before the pandemic when it listed the entire downtown portfolio for sale in mid-2019, an offering it hoped would fetch bids close to $1.3 billion as demand for downtown office space soared. But the collection never traded, and the buildings' value was hammered by softened demand during the public health crisis.OTHER ASSETSThe 48-year-old building at 30 N. LaSalle isn't AmTrust's only local distressed asset. The firm earlier this year was negotiating a deal to surrender its 1.3 million-square-foot office tower at 135 S. LaSalle St. to its lender rather than face a likely lawsuit over a loan default, a move known as a deed in lieu of foreclosure, according to a Bloomberg report tied to AmTrust's $100 million loan on the property. The building was left mostly vacant after the departure of Bank of America to a new namesake tower on Wacker Drive. The status of those deed-in-lieu negotiations is unclear.While AmTrust sorts out its LaSalle Street issues, other landlords on the historic corridor are trying to do the same. The owner of a vintage 16-story office building at 19 S. LaSalle St. was recently hit with a $21 million foreclosure lawsuit, while similar lawsuits have been filed involving the majority of an office tower just off LaSalle at 105 W. Adams St. and a block of offices above the JW Marriott Chicago hotel at 208 S. LaSalle St.The owners of two other big LaSalle Street office buildings at 10 S. LaSalle St. and 1 N. LaSalle St. also recently had their loans transferred to special servicers, typically a sign they are in danger of default. Those loans were packaged with other mortgages and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, making it more difficult for the borrowers to modify loan terms.Mayor Lori Lightfoot is hoping some of the distressed LaSalle Street office buildings will be at least partially converted into apartments. With an eye on restoring foot traffic to the heart of the Loop, her administration recently rolled out a program offering public subsidies to help finance such conversions if developers commit to making at least 30% of the units affordable.",

  "Title": "A WORKERS MOVEMENT IN PROGRESS",
  "Text": "Matteo Hintz proudly claims his family's union pedigree. Like many families in Chicago and Illinois, he says he \"was born and raised in a union house.\" His grandfather was a railroad switchman in Illinois, directing trains to their final destination. His father belongs to a union that represents Illinois state park superintendents.\"My dad takes union stuff very seriously because my grandpa took it seriously. And now I'm trying to do the same.\"Hintz is doing just that by organizing colleagues at the Field Museum in their second attempt to unionize. Workers at the natural history museum will begin voting in early February, with votes being counted in early March.Hintz, 26, who builds structures that encase some of the Field Museum's most priceless objects, is part of a push in labor organizing that is being led most visibly by professional and technical workers seeking not just higher wages, job security and better working conditions, but also social changes highlighted by the social justice movement. The pandemic spotlighted social and economic divides as well as those in the workplace. Workers more likely to be organizing today are school principals, health care workers, college faculty and graduate students, publishing professionals and cultural workers.This new class of union members is also younger and politically progressive. Unions, as political observers know, also play a critical role in determining who gets elected, especially in Chicago. In the mayoral race, current Mayor Lori Lightfoot has her trade union allies. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and U.S. Rep. Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda have both picked up endorsements and dollars from top influential and progressive unions.\"The pandemic changed the way people thought about their labor, changed what they wanted from work and what the workplace should be like,\" says Robert Bruno, a professor and director of the labor studies program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \"It was really a change in worker consciousness.\"Over the last year, workers at some of the nation's highest-profile companies\u0097Starbucks, Amazon, Trader Joe's, Apple, Microsoft, HarperCollins and Chipotle\u0097have organized.Fourteen Starbucks stores have held elections through Chicago's National Labor Relations Board office. Ten resulted in union victories. More recently, Starbucks workers at Old Orchard Mall voted 10 to 7 to unionize. Nationally, workers at 278 Starbucks stores have approved a union.Last year, the Art Institute of Chicago became the city's first major cultural institution to see employees organize. Adjunct professors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago followed with their own election victory. In early January, Northwestern University graduate students voted to unionize, joining their counterparts at campuses across the country and notching one of the largest union wins in Illinois. The vote, 1,644 to 114, was a landslide victory.And later in the month, Steppenwolf Theatre workers voted decisively to be represented by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.But as workers in different industries unionize and grab headlines, organized labor nationally continues to see historic declines, and it remains unclear whether this moment will bring brief victories for wage earners or is the first phase of a larger push by workers to bargain collectively for themselves in a tight and shifting labor market.STIRRING FROM A LONG SLUMBERThe labor movement has long ties to Chicago, from the fight over the eight-hour workday and the Haymarket affair in 1886 to the Pullman railroad strike in 1894 and the Memorial Day Massacre during the \"little steel\" strikes in 1937.Even as unions saw flagging memberships in the last decades, Chicago was still at a higher rate than the national average, says Bob Reiter, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. \"There's always something going on around unionization in Chicago,\" he says.But despite Chicago's steady union membership, Illinois has seen significant declines. Union membership in Illinois fell to 13.1% in 2022 from 20.8% in 1989. Nationally, unions followed a similar trend as the share of the workforce in labor unions dropped to 10.1%. That's the lowest on record, according to recent data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, despite union members growing by 273,000 last year. The reason for the record low: Organizing couldn't keep up with the booming job market, which added 5.3 million jobs over that same stretch, outpacing labor gains.Twenty years ago, manufacturing accounted for 2.8 million union workers nationwide. Since 2000, manufacturing has lost around 1.7 million members, a 61.6% decrease to roughly 1 million members. While the blue-collar workforce was long the bread-and-butter of industrial union organizing, new fields and industries are on the rise.In the health care sector, nurses concerned about understaffing in some cases and layoffs in others are exerting their collective power. Nurses led a quarter of the major work stoppages last year, according to BLS tracking reported by The Washington Post. In early January, 440 Howard Brown Health workers held a three-day strike at several of the health system's clinics across Chicago in response to layoffs.Workers in education services, restaurants and the gig economy at companies like Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft and Trader Joe's made union moves in recent years. Some see the sustainable-energy sector to be the next frontier for unions. The Illinois Legislature sent a bill to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's desk in early January that would relax restrictive zoning regulations that have slowed wind and solar energy projects. That could potentially bring thousands of new jobs to the state, making the industry a new target for unions.Union support is at an all-time high. Seventy-one percent of Americans now approve of labor unions, the highest Gallup has recorded on this measure since 1965, arming organizers with the power of public support.\"There's always a structural advantage for the employer, but right now, workers are finding themselves in a stronger position with more leverage and can now be more selective about where they work,\" Bruno says. That strength led in part to the \"great resignation\" of 2021, when the rate of job quitting in the U.S. reached highs not seen since the start of the BLS Job Openings &amp; Labor Turnover Survey program in December 2000.\"Millions came to realize that their jobs could really kill them during the pandemic and that the employer was probably not going to champion their best long-term interests,\" says Bruno.In 2021, the Illinois General Assembly commissioned the Illinois Future of Work Task Force, which examined challenges and opportunities related to the state's workforce. The task force, composed of policy experts, legislators and scholars, looked at how the state could best recover from the pandemic and \"confront the worsening crisis of poverty.\"Reporting in 2022, the task force concluded that it's not enough to have a job. Rather, it's job quality that matters. The report's authors recommended that the state adopt a job quality measurement; extend benefits to more workers, including independent contractors and other nontraditional workers; and expand equitable access to education and training programs for K-12 and postsecondary students to help close the racial gap in access to high-growth career pathways. The authors added that as \"workers navigate the changed economy, there has been renewed interest in unionizing.\"But employers don't always embrace union activity. Employees who organize can face anti-union rhetoric, intimidation and even job loss. An NLRB ruling in December, viewed as a victory for organized labor, expanded the fees and penalties the federal agency can collect from employers that illegally fire workers for organizing and other labor activism.\"Employees are not made whole until they are fully compensated for financial harms that they suffered as a result of unlawful conduct,\" NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said in a statement. Previously, employers that fired workers for their involvement in labor organizing only had to pay for the employee's reinstatement and lost wages.But even after employees win elections and certify their union representatives, employers can drag out contract negotiations for years. The average time it takes to agree on a first contract is 465 days, oftentimes outlasting employees in high-turnover job sectors.The University of Illinois Chicago faculty union, after winning an election in 2012, only approved its first contract in May 2014, after a faculty-led walkout led to hundreds of canceled classes and lasted two days. UIC faculty held a nearly weeklong strike earlier this month after they failed to reach a contract agreement with the school's administration over compensation and mental health services for students, among other items.A YOUNGER CROWDFor Hintz, the Field Museum worker, the summer 2020 social justice protests across the country \"lit a fire under us\" and inspired his first organizing.\"We felt the need to do something bigger after the protests,\" he says. \"We've got to make sure that everyone in the museum is being treated equally, and we have to make sure we are getting compensated adequately.\"What makes today's labor movement different are its ties to the fight for social justice and equity. \"This isn't just your mom and dad's meat and potatoes kind of union,\" Bruno says. \"There's a linkage of the political and social values of younger workers\" that the professor believes has created a new \"worker consciousness.\"Younger workers are \"now looking at the labor movement and saying, 'Hey, you know what, this is a body that can champion not just my workplace interests, but can help me promote my vision of what I want to be working for within my society,' \" Bruno says.It's exciting to see younger workers organizing this union movement at the museum, says Anna Balla, who works at the collections registrar at the Field Museum. Balla spent 12 years at the museum before management gave her a raise. She asked for the increase only after she couldn't afford rent on her old salary.\"Even then, it wasn't much, and they changed my title, but they make it feel like you should be grateful to be working at the museum and that's enough,\" says Balla, 48. \"I don't want the younger workers experiencing that.\"On college campuses, graduate students at some of the country's most elite private institutions have achieved union victories. The year started with students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology winning a union election, followed by counterparts at Yale and Northwestern universities. Next month, graduate students at the University of Chicago will cast their votes on a union, and others are expected to follow.\"Look at Amazon, look at all these different campaigns that are also happening right now,\" says Sara Bowden, a doctoral student in music theory and cognition and co-chair of Northwestern University Graduate Workers, or NUGW. \"This is a starting point for educating an entire new generation of people, like folks at private universities, about what work can mean, and I think that's going to significantly shape the way that we see labor in the future.\"NUGW says its demands include higher base stipends, paid sick days, coverage of visa renewal costs for international graduate workers and more comprehensive health insurance. The union says it will seek at least $40,000 per student in a new stipend that would put them more in line with other top private schools like Columbia, Princeton and Harvard. NU's current minimum stipend is $35,000.\"We're seeing a lot of those old-fashioned unions stepping into higher education because they understand that there's something there and there's huge potential for organizing,\" says Gali Racabi, an assistant professor who teaches labor and employment law at Cornell University. Gali believes that this new alignment of U.S. elites at Yale, Harvard and Northwestern, who are all unionized, represents an \"almost unfathomable alliance\" that makes for a potentially new kind of partnership and coalition in U.S. politics.CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONWhen Illinois Constitutional Amendment 1, or the Workers' Rights Amendment, passed, Pritzker hailed it as a major win for workers' rights in Illinois' \"rich union history.\"The amendment added language to the state's constitution that protects the rights of workers to unionize, including the ability to \"negotiate wages, hours, and working conditions, and to protect their economic welfare and safety at work.\"\"It is the strongest constitutional protection of any state in the nation,\" says Frank Manzo, executive director of the Illinois Economic Policy Institute.Surrounded by right-to-work states, which allow employees in unionized workplaces to opt out of joining a union, Illinois has cemented its place as a friend to organized labor in the Midwest, giving fuel to the belief that Illinois is hostile to business.In the past year, high-profile businesses\u0097Citadel, Boeing, Caterpillar and Tyson Foods\u0097have left the state. While these companies didn't cite labor as an issue\u0097a lot has been made of Chicago's crime problems\u0097their moves are a hit on the state's reputation, especially as these companies head to Southern states with friendlier business climates.This isn't only a big business problem, but small businesses, already hurt by inflation, will also suffer, says Todd Maisch, president of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce. \"When the union reps come knocking on small businesses' doors, (businesses are) going to say, 'How much of my thin margin is this union going to take from me and is it time for me to shut the doors?' \" The terms are stark for Maisch: Unionize, and small businesses will close.Maisch doesn't see the Workers' Rights Amendment having an immediate effect. The amendment's real impact will come five years down the line, he says, after pro-union lawyers have \"expanded, expanded, expanded and expanded all interpretations and uses of the amendment.\"Manzo doesn't hold the same outlook. He points out that in this historically tight labor market, companies are in need of employees. The new union protections could help retain workers and prevent costly turnover, while also attracting higher-skilled workers, now that Illinois has some of the strongest labor protections in the country.\"Just as businesses compete for customers, they must also compete for workers,\" Manzo says. \"And winning in the market for workers is all about job quality,\" which he believes the amendment will boost.While conclusions on the amendment's fiscal consequences aren't clear, what experts do believe is that by strengthening worker protections, it will embolden a union-curious workforce. Fiscal year 2022 saw 2,510 union representation petitions filed with NLRB's 48 field offices\u0097a 53% increase from the 1,638 petitions filed in fiscal year 2021. That's the highest number since 2016 and is expected to grow in 2023.Workers \"feel a little stronger, a little more emboldened,\" Bruno says. \"I would expect organizing to increase, and workers who haven't been approached before about organizing will start to sign union cards.\"But despite decades of declining union memberships nationwide\u0097a sobering trend for organizers who were buoyed by last year's high-profile labor wins\u0097labor appears to have plenty of friends in Chicago. For Reiter of the Chicago Federation of Labor, labor will continue to grow as organizers \"drill deeper into these niche workplaces.\"FIND THE COMPLETE SERIES ONLINE ChicagoBusiness.com/CrainsForum",

  "Title": "Lightfoot should listen to Griffin",
  "Text": "Whatever you think of Ken Griffin's politics\u0097too conservative for my taste\u0097you have to acknowledge his sense of timing.Griffin's declaration that he's tired of waiting for the city to get its public safety act together and will move Citadel's headquarters out of town if the situation doesn't improve is the right message at the right time about Chicago's embattled downtown jobs base.Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not want to hear it. Re-election season is the occasion for happy talk and optimism, not warnings. But as the city enters the warm-weather killing season, the message must be heard. And not just for well-off downtown businesses, either. According to data the University of Chicago Crime Lab put together for me, Chicago homicides in 2021 among Black people per 100,000 residents were at the highest level in more than 20 years\u0097and 40 times higher than among non-Latino white people. Yes, 40 times. They don't need another summer from hell.Does Lightfoot have a plan to deal with that as June, July and August roll around? Not the long-range moves to reinvest in impoverished neighborhoods that Lightfoot and every other politician within sight support, but actual plans that actually could make a difference right now?Voters can judge for themselves about whether the mayor is or is not delivering. Meanwhile, here's what other people who are running or who kicked the tires on running for mayor said when I asked them what they would do right now to prevent a summer of carnage.Ald. Rod Sawyer, 6th, said he'd fire Police Superintendent David Brown, who in his view is \"a nice guy, but over his head.\" Next on Sawyer's list is hiring people who can talk to aimless, bored youth so that police don't have to choose between filling the jails with curfew violators and ignoring the law.I heard that same thing\u0097talk to the young adults and teens who are behind much of the problem, and figure out what it will take to fix things\u0097a lot.Former Chicago Public Schools chief Paul Vallas said he'd open all public schools on weekday evenings and weekends to offer academic support amid the pandemic, serve as a base for work-study programs and most important, \"place them in safe-mentoring environments and keep them fully engaged.\" He'd also create comprehensive victim and witness protection programs and enact a nuisance ordinance that would \"hold flash mobs, looters, rioters, those that damage property and those who incite any of those actions, both criminally and civically responsible.\"State Rep. Kam Buckner, the son of a former cop, said he'd start by convening a high-level talk involving the mayor, Brown, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx, Chief Cook County Circuit Court Judge Tim Evans and Sheriff Tom Dart to hammer out a highly visible, coordinated approach. He'd consider loosening qualifications for new cops\u0097i.e., allowing people with nonviolent misdemeanor violations to apply and hopefully fill a 1,000-officer shortfall. And he'd put counselors, anti-violence coordinators and others downtown, now, so that everybody isn't caught flat-footed next time trouble breaks out.Former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan would fund a \"massive\" jobs program this summer; a tired kid is probably a kid that just goes home after work. He'd end most centralized police units that pull police from neighborhoods, because the gangs \"no longer are citywide.\" And he'd place a much greater emphasis on outreach via trained anti-violence units that some research suggests make a real difference in stopping the cycle of retaliation shootings.Ald. Ray Lopez, 15th, said that, given the difficulty of recruiting police as long as Lightfoot is mayor, the city needs to double down on technology, such as cameras. Summer jobs programs shouldn't just be for kids, he added. And empty city-owned facilities should be turned into local community centers.Others I talked to, who prefer not to go public, say the jobs program really needs to be targeted at those at highest risk of committing violence. They also assert that, despite a shortage of police, the city can turn the corner in high-crime areas by sensibly deploying them in areas of need, rather than having them stand around downtown imitating scarecrows.As for Lightfoot, here's what her office said after Griffin spoke: Though some companies go, lots are coming in to Chicago. The business momentum underway is palpable.\"Sigh.",

  "Title": "How Willie Wilson built the fortune that fuels his giveaways",
  "Text": "From his 49th-floor penthouse at the St. Regis\u0097not to be confused with the high-rise next door that he departed when his new home blocked his Lake Michigan views\u0097millionaire businessman Willie Wilson keeps tabs on his company and directs his third campaign for mayor.Adorned with newspapers and photos chronicling his life, the apartment mirrors a public image crafted from Wilson's large personality and rise from a Louisiana sharecropper to millionaire who freely hands out cash across the city he overlooks.Even if he fails to make the runoff, the 74-year-old's presence will be felt in the race as his base of support in majority-Black wards makes the math difficult for other candidates relying on votes from Black residents on the South and West sides.With one eye on his phone, Wilson spoke with Crain's about his campaign and revealed he'd recently sold off a stake in his company, Omar Medical Supplies, for the first time.But there are limits to what Wilson will discuss. He won't say if he repeated his 2016 vote for Trump in 2020 and retreats to criticizing other candidates for accepting big-money contributions when pressed on why he won't release his tax returns.Wilson moved to Chicago in 1965, settling in North Lawndale at the tail end of the Great Migration of Black Southerners to Northern cities, which he says made the city \"feel like home.\"In 1970, he began working at McDonald's as a janitor and says his willingness to continue working while his white managers walked out on strike won him his first managerial job. Eventually wanting a store of his own, but without the capital to buy a franchise, he directly appealed to the CEO who turned the burger chain into a household name.\"I went to Ray Kroc at a shareholder meeting,\" he says. \"He gave me the opportunity to get my own store, and then 2 \u00bd years later, I owned five McDonald's.\"His franchises introduced Wilson to the McDonald's supplier ecosystem and sparked the idea to become one himself, selling his restaurants to build a business supplying plastic gloves to the fast-food giant.Wilson named the company after his late son, Omar, who was murdered at age 20 inside Wilson's suburban home in 1995, following what Wilson believes was an argument over drugs.MAKING A CHANGENow living with his second wife, Janette, Wilson says a renewed commitment to his faith pushed him to make a change in his life at the time.\"I wanted to make money so that I could help others,\" he says. \"These things have never been planned by me. It was really just trying to work hard and make a living to help family and others.\"Wilson says West Side Congressman Danny Davis helped him land a contract with Walmart that lifted his business to a higher level. Although Davis made the initial introduction, Wilson says \"you don't get it overnight\" and Walmart vetted his business for years before he landed a contract.Davis recalls Richard Boykin\u0097a former Cook County commissioner\u0097then serving as chief of staff to Davis and currently running Wilson's campaign, drove with Wilson to Arkansas to make the introduction.\"All we did was just indicate that he was trying to do business with them,\" says Davis, who hails from Arkansas. \"His acumen and astuteness and business sense did all the rest.\"Omar Medical sells plastic gloves, garbage can liners and similar products to McDonald's and other retail chains around the world. Wilson himself is not a doctor, but goes by \"Dr. Willie Wilson\"\u0097a reference to the honorary doctorates he's received.A private company, Omar Medical doesn't disclose financial information. The limited publicly available information on Wilson's finances comes from a 2020 report filed during an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate against longtime Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin.Wilson reported $511,579 in income from Omar and $175,000 from Willie Wilson Productions, a separate company that has produced the \"Singsation\" gospel program airing on WGN-TV on Sunday mornings.His disclosure valued Omar at between $25 million and $50 million. He also reported assets, including his Hazel Crest home (he rents his Wacker Drive penthouse), stock options and bank accounts valued between $2.4 million and $5 million.Wilson says he finances his lifestyle with investment returns while \"giving away\" his salary, including high-profile gas and grocery giveaways\u0097which he says he'll continue even if elected mayor\u0097and support for a network of churches.Wilson is the only mayoral candidate who hasn't disclosed at least partial tax returns, telling Crain's, \"I'll show my taxes right now\" if other candidates return contributions from donors who do business with the city.While Wilson says his company does not have any contracts with the city, it was listed as a minority participant, splitting a 30% stake in an up to $30 million contract from the city's sister agency, Chicago Public Schools, awarded to Office Depot.Wilson told Crain's in December he didn't believe he'd need to divest himself of his company or put his assets in a blind trust if he were elected mayor, but Boykin later said Wilson had decided he would sell off his stake in Omar Medical \"so there is no potential or direct conflict of interest with the city or its sister agencies.\"Wilson would not divest himself from his production company because he believes there would be no conflicts, Boykin said.Whatever Omar's revenue stream might be, Wilson now owns just 51% of it after selling a minority stake to longtime company President Andre Fair and a pair of local businessmen with their own ties to McDonald's supply chain. Wilson declined to name the other investors, but according to a filing with the Illinois secretary of state, William Weimer and Matthew Cook are listed as managers along with Wilson and Fair.Weimer is the former chief financial officer of Naperville-based OSI Group, a major McDonald's meat supplier, and Cook was CEO of LBP Manufacturing, a packaging supplier. Fair confirmed he was an investor. Cook and Weimer did not return requests for comment.Wilson won't say how much he received for the minority stake. He insists the sale was not needed to finance another run for mayor, saying, \"If I didn't have my own money I wouldn't be in this game.\"His wealth has not only funded his own campaigns\u0097including $6 million this cycle\u0097but is directed to elected officials where he hopes to pick up votes.Since 2019, Wilson has contributed heavily to conservative aldermen in Chicago, including $11,000 to Ald. Ray Lopez, 15th; $9,000 to Ald. Jim Gardiner, 45th; $5,500 to Ald. Nick Sposato, 38th; and $2,000 to Ald. Anthony Napolitano, 41st.BRANCHING OUTAs one of seven Black candidates, Wilson will be hard-pressed to make the runoff only by winning majority-Black wards.\"He clearly knows that he needs to go beyond his comfort zone, beyond his base, and he's been actively doing that,\" says Lopez, who ended his own candidacy for mayor in November and endorsed Wilson last month.Recent polls from opposing campaigns show Wilson third or fourth in the nine-way race, with a poll from incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot pegging his support at 11%, matching Wilson's share of the vote in both 2015 and 2019.Wilson is a frequent guest at political events on the Northwest Side, and Sposato says Wilson's \"batshit crazy generosity\"\u0097the millions in gas and groceries he's given away since last year, including from a heavy cluster of stores on the Northwest Side\u0097raised his profile in the area.\"Every time he comes, everybody wants to take a picture, everybody wants to shake his hand and everybody asks me, 'Is Willie coming, is Willie coming?' And I go, 'He always comes\u0097I don't invite him, but somehow, someway, he finds out,' \" Sposato says. A Lightfoot ally, Sposato says he won't endorse a mayoral candidate before the runoff.At events, Wilson is as likely to offer a prayer as he is to launch into a stump speech. When he talks policy, he sticks to simple promises of not raising taxes and taking \"the handcuffs off the police and putting them on the criminals.\"During a recent mayoral debate, Wilson sparked controversy with his criticism of new limits on police pursuits of fleeing suspects, arguing officers should be allowed to \"hunt them down like a rabbit.\"In seeking support from conservative voters, Wilson could open himself up to attack in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, says former Ald. Michael Scott Jr., 24th. Scott has not endorsed a candidate but was an ally of Lightfoot on the City Council and was appointed by the mayor to the Chicago Board of Education. He predicts Lightfoot and others would soon hit Wilson for his past support for Trump. Lightfoot in particular needs to peel away Black voters from Wilson if she hopes to win.Despite his decades-old friendship with Wilson, Davis has endorsed Lightfoot after backing Wilson in 2015 and 2019, saying he made a political calculation to back the city's incumbent Black mayor who has invested in the South and West sides.Wilson says he doesn't regret the millions he's spent on his campaigns\u0097even if he comes up short again.\"Let people judge me for what you see me doing,\" he says. \"If that don't do it, it just ain't that important.\"",

  "Title": "City's spending plan for affordable homes shows little progress",
  "Text": "A year ago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration announced $1 billion would go toward affordable housing, the largest investment ever in Chicago history. The funds would help finance 24 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit developments and create or preserve 2,400 affordable rental units across the city.More than two-thirds of the developments would be concentrated on the West and South sides, the rest in less affordable neighborhoods on the North Side.\"What the city's doing through these investments is trying to create dedicated affordable units through this subsidy program and through these strategic investments,\" said Geoff Smith, executive director and principal investigator of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.The pandemic and inflation make the need for more affordable housing units more critical, advocates say. Demand for affordable housing exceeded supply in Chicago by 159,000 units even before the pandemic, according to the institute.So far little progress has been made since Lightfoot's announcement, and affordable housing proponents and activists question whether a real commitment exists. To date, zero dollars have been spent on developing mixed-use projects that include affordable housing. None of the 24 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit developments has broken ground. Only $450,000 has gone to owner-occupied repair grants, according to the Chicago Recovery Plan update report.Marisa Novara, commissioner of Chicago's Department of Housing, says 17 of the 24 developments are scheduled to close on financing by the end of 2023. In total, the department expects 31 affordable housing projects to have closed on financing by the end of next year. Some of the developments are from a previous funding round.Two of the upcoming Low-Income Housing Tax Credit developments, the Laramie State Bank redevelopment in Austin and Thrive Englewood, are part of the Invest South/West initiative designed to revitalize disinvested communities. Austin is 58.7% renter-occupied with nearly 30% of the population living below the poverty level, compared with 18% for the entire city of Chicago. Englewood is 23.8% renter-occupied, and 40.8% of the population lives below the poverty level.Crain's reported in September that after three years, no Invest South/West developments had begun construction.The Austin project is scheduled to close on financing this month and can potentially begin construction this year, Novara says. The Laramie State Bank site was proposed as a $37.5 million development with 76 affordable housing units. Thrive Englewood, estimated to cost $28.4 million, will include two phases with a total of 103 apartment units with 10 qualifying as affordable. The Thrive plan was approved in the summer, but representatives of DL3 Realty, the developer, have not indicated when ground will be broken.Inflation has driven up the costs of materials, and that means project budgets will have to be rethought, Novara says.Last spring, the Chicago City Council approved the acquisition of several lots at the intersection of Peoria and 18th streets in Pilsen for $12 million with the intent to create affordable housing.In mid-December, three scenarios for developing the site were presented to the community. A 30-day public comment period will follow a formal proposal that will be drafted in January for the site. No developer is currently slated for the project.Teresa Fraga, a longtime Pilsen resident and community activist, has been involved in the process with the vacant land since 2005 as part of the Pilsen Land Use Committee.Fraga, who has attended community meetings about the development, says the biggest issue is making sure the city keeps its promise of making the development 100% affordable. She says that during some of the meetings, there has been backpedaling on the promise, with representatives of the Department of Planning &amp; Development saying the development would be \"mostly affordable.\"\"The DOH is not saying what the percentages of (affordability) are,\" says Fraga, who says that if 100% affordability isn't viable, she wants to be given a reason why. She says that if it can't be 100%, then part of her job is knowing how many years any affordability requirements will stay in place.",

  "Title": "A new Crown steps into the civic spotlight",
  "Text": "At a reception last summer at the Museum of Contemporary Art, an exhibition of works by Chicago artist Nick Cave wasn't the only center of attention. Jim Crown, scion of one of Chicago's richest families, was immobilized by a throng of well-wishers on the museum's terrace.Crown, though, is on the move elsewhere. Since October, he's been leading a public safety task force established by the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago. At 69, he may be finally stepping into his father Lester's civic leadership shoes to take on Chicago's scourge of gun violence and the city's regrettable global image as one big crime scene. The issue is more intractable and politically radioactive than even the knotty ones like O'Hare expansion and a new county hospital the elder Crown took on.Just what the Civic Committee and Crown hope to accomplish is unclear. Neither would discuss the task force's objectives or even disclose its membership.\"There isn't much substance to report on right now, other than the fact that the Civic Committee shares the concerns of many other Chicago citizens about this issue and is in the process of listening and learning as to where we might be constructive,\" Crown said in a text.The big unknown is whether there will be a plan that Crown himself will attempt to put into action, whether others will try to or whether a blue-ribbon report due by spring will simply gather dust.The Civic Committee's effort reflects the freighted moment in American politics in the wake of George Floyd's murder at the hands of police in 2020, the rise of the Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police movements and the routine spasms of gun violence plaguing Chicago and other cities. New leadership at the Civic Committee and its parent, the Commercial Club of Chicago, is another factor in establishing the task force.After shunning the spotlight for so long, can Jim Crown rise to the occasion as his 97-year-old father steps back, at a time when Chicago's boardroom leadership has become less cohesive and city politics more fractured?\"He would be doing a great service for the city,\" says businessman and former gubernatorial candidate Ron Gidwitz, who nonetheless wonders if Crown has \"the political chops to make a difference.\"Jacky Grimshaw, a top aide to Mayor Harold Washington and a vice president at the Center for Neighborhood Technology, isn't so sure. \"I wish I could say this is a brilliant choice because he's done this, that and other things. Lester is civic-minded. He cares about the city. Jim hasn't followed in his footsteps out here.\"FAMILIAR CAUSESUrban violence and its roots are not new causes for the Crowns. The family donated $75 million in 2021 to the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago, now the Crown School of Social Work, Policy &amp; Practice. Crown Family Philanthropies is among the sponsors of the Partnership for Safe &amp; Peaceful Communities, which has doled out $90 million to anti-violence efforts since 2016.In North Lawndale, one of the partnership's target communities, murders last year declined by nearly half. \"Can you imagine (that result over) the whole city? It'd be a different story,\" says Arne Duncan, a front-line anti-gun activist as CEO of Create Real Economic Destiny, which mentors at-risk youth. Ric Estrada, CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, a family service agency, says, \"We all have similar goals. It would be great if we can agree on five important ones.\"In June, the Crown Family foundation hosted a Loop breakfast meeting attended by Jim Crown, two dozen other business and civic leaders, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago Crime Lab and Duncan, the Civic Committee says. Ludwig, who isn't commenting, offered to conduct a later \"executive education\" session for businesspeople.A few weeks later, the Civic Committee hired Derek Douglas as its president. The African American and former Obama White House aide, his Yale Law School pedigree aside, represents a shift in positioning for the committee. Douglas was a vice president for civic engagement and external affairs at U of C, where his job involved dealing with crime and other sensitive neighborhood issues.Douglas says the job also exposed him to civic and corporate leaders, among them Crown, who advised on campus safety. At the Civic Committee, Douglas polled members about top-of-mind concerns. Crime was obvious. That's when Douglas asked Crown to head up a task force, he says.\"I just heard that over and over, and that influenced me, that we should create a task force,\" Douglas says.There's a good argument to be made that corporate Chicago became alarmed only after street violence invaded the Loop and adjacent business districts, and wealthy residents like Ken Griffin piped up and left town, along with Boeing, Caterpillar and other corporate headquarters. In September, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski aired his concerns at the Economic Club of Chicago, drawing a rebuke from Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Business wants to see police visible in front of establishments for their own benefit. It's not doing anything to address gun violence in Englewood or Austin,\" says David Olson, a Loyola University Chicago criminology professor. At the same time, he says, past anti-violence efforts have fallen short for lack of business participation.Evan Hochberg, president of Crown Family Philanthropies, says it's difficult to build coalitions around such complex issues. Dealing with City Hall, now that even aldermanic elections have been ideologically \"nationalized\" beyond ward service issues, is another hurdle.\"You could count on certain procedures to be in place even under a corrupt government,\" says Paul O'Connor, former executive director of World Business Chicago. \"It was a known system. Now, it's moved to a more ideological base.\"One Chicago business leader isn't waiting for an organized corporate effort. River North landlord Albert Friedman hired off-duty police in his nine-block Courthouse District and scavenger service and graffiti busters to clear alleys and clean sidewalks and building exteriors. Friedman won't say how much he spends, only that his 20,000 tenants share the cost.Still, he acknowledges, \"I can't take care of the entire city. You have to be a team.\"After Kempczinski's comments ignited a political firestorm, McDonald's pledged $3.5 million to 40 neighborhood organizations. (It also says Kempczinski joined the Crown-led task force.) The CEO had called for \"more partnership\" in addressing crime.VESTED INTERESTThe Crowns have a vested interest in the fate of Chicago, a link that goes back more than a century, to Jim Crown's grandfather Henry and his brothers starting a sand and gravel business that grew into construction supplier Material Service Corp. Forbes in 2020 ranked the Crowns as the 34th richest U.S. family, with an estimated net worth of $10.2 billion.Jim Crown succeeded his father in 2018 as chairman and CEO of Henry Crown &amp; Co., where he has worked for most of his career. He also sits on the boards of two of the company's primary public holdings, defense contractor General Dynamics and bank JPMorgan Chase. In the civic realm, he's a trustee of the University of Chicago (chairing the board for six years) and the Museum of Science &amp; Industry.But unlike his father, he hasn't been the face of major citywide initiatives. \"Jim is more business, business, Crown enterprises,\" says Ty Fahner, a former Civic Committee and Commercial Club president.Crown family interests include big investments in Chicago real estate. They have partnered with developer Sterling Bay, where Jim Crown's nephew Keating Crown is active in acquiring properties in the bustling Fulton Market neighborhood. The Crowns also have invested in Sterling Bay's massive Lincoln Yards project on the city's North Side and its 47-story tower at 300 N. Michigan Ave. Another Crown-owned site at 130 N. Franklin St. has been awaiting redevelopment for decades.Urbanologist Aaron Renn says the Crowns' economic ties to the city and its reputation are \"actually good. It aligns their interests.\" He attributes New York City's lower crime rate, in part, to extensive Manhattan real estate holdings by wealthy families.\"This clearly was not his father's issue,\" Duncan says of Jim Crown. \"The city is in a different place. This is uniquely his own.\"",

  "Title": "AT HOME ON LASALLE",
  "Text": "LaSalle Street traditionally has been the center of Chicago's wealth\u0097the historic home to major banks, financial firms and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, many housed in architectural masterpieces such as The Rookery. If the street becomes a hub for affordable housing, with health care workers, hotel clerks and garage attendants joining the software engineers and financial analysts living downtown, it will be a 180-degree turn.With iconic office buildings emptying out, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is offering tax-increment financing funds and other incentives to convert unwanted office space to apartments, with 30% of the units to be designated affordable. The city this fall issued an invitation for proposals to create 1,000 apartments with 300 affordable units over the next five years. Proposals are due Dec. 23.While affordable housing is much in need, bringing these units to the Loop will be a challenging exercise. Construction is more expensive downtown and especially in the historically significant buildings along LaSalle Street. The location away from the lakefront and a lack of amenities could constrain rents for market-rate units.\"There have been plenty of adaptive reuses of historic office buildings, but at the higher end without affordable components, says architect Jeff Bone, a partner at Landon Bone Baker Architects, which specializes in affordable housing.To be sure, Bone and others welcome the possibility of democratizing the elite street. Most of the nearly 34,000 apartments in the Loop and West Loop are market rate. Currently, there are no affordable apartments on LaSalle Street and only eight are completed or under construction in the Loop, according to the city's proposal. Office conversions offer the chance to bring more evening and weekend life to a district that's largely quiet after 5 p.m.Advocates for affordable housing say the addition of affordable units is always needed, but they question the wisdom of building downtown. Lacking schools and supermarkets, the Loop isn't designed for families, the demographic perceived to be most in need of affordable housing, advocates say. Most downtown units are studios and one-bedrooms, appealing to singles, couples without children and empty nesters.City dollars, it is argued, could be more efficiently applied to affordable housing in North Side neighborhoods, where longtime residents are being priced out, or to disinvested South and West Side communities. \"For the cost of building an affordable unit downtown, you could create two affordable units in the neighborhoods, in Lincoln Park or Lakeview,\" says Rafael Leon, executive director of the Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.It remains to be seen how much interest the city's invitation will draw from developers and whether the economics will work for conversion in general and, more specifically, for affordable units.\"The feasibility depends on how much the city is willing to offer,\" says developer Mike Reschke, whose venture purchased the largely vacant BMO Harris Bank office buildings along Monroe Street between LaSalle and Clark streets.VACANCIES PLAGUE LASALLE STREETLaSalle Street was in peril before the pandemic as developers lured major banks to sparkling new office buildings: BMO Harris to the recently completed BMO Tower next to Union Station and Bank of America to the Bank of America Tower at 110 N. Wacker Drive.The pandemic exacerbated the situation as office staffs retreated to working from home. Analysts expect the new normal will shake out as a hybrid schedule with workers showing up three days a week.A quarter of the office space along the LaSalle corridor is vacant, the city notes in its invitation for proposals, and 36% of retail space is unoccupied, the highest of any downtown submarket.The city is offering funding assistance for up to three proposals to convert office space, with at least 30% of the apartments on-site to be affordable units.The government defines affordable housing as a residence that doesn't cost more than 30% of a family's monthly income. An individual or family can qualify for an affordable apartment if they earn less than the Chicago area's median income: $104,200 for a family of four and $73,000 for a single. The city sets maximum rents for apartments subsidized by low-income housing tax credits and other government incentives.The city wants the affordable units along LaSalle Street to be accessible to a cohort earning an average 60% of area median income, referred to as AMI. A family of four earning 60% of AMI, or $62,520, would pay no more than $1,539 for a three-bedroom apartment in a high-rise, assuming the tenant pays all utilities. In contrast, the average rent for a three-bedroom apartment in the Loop is more than $4,000, according to brokerage Downtown Apartment Co., although there aren't many larger apartments available. A single person earning 60% of the AMI, or $43,800, would pay $1,044 for a studio in a high-rise building.The city drew inspiration from an Urban Land Institute report issued early this year that offered a blueprint for reimagining LaSalle Street. That includes providing new housing at a range of prices \"that would allow households at different income levels to live in the Loop,\" as well as schools, grocery stores, medical offices, cafes and restaurants. With an eye to an even more striking transformation, the report suggests a pedestrian plaza with pop-up kiosks, stringing lights between lampposts and painting the street.Such a sweeping transformation could be a bridge too far for some. \"We don't need street festivals downtown. Those belong in the neighborhoods and the parks,\" Reschke says. \"We need people to come back downtown and go to work every day, not just Tuesday through Thursday.\"COMPENSATING FOR LOWER RENTSDevelopers will have to first determine whether they can make money converting an office tower to residential, then calculate whether the city incentives can make the affordable component attractive.The rental market is favorable. The Loop's residential occupancy is in the 95% range, although landlords are still offering incentives, says Maurice Ortiz, director of operations at brokerage Apartment People. There are 33,879 apartments in the Loop (including the West Loop), with 2,295 under construction, according to CBRE.With interest rates climbing, the market to buy and sell homes has petered out, so more people will have no choice but to rent, says Justin Puppi, senior associate at CBRE. The addition of 3,000 to 5,000 Google workers at the Thompson Center in about four years will add to the demand for housing, food and other services.Developers gain an advantage if they can purchase a distressed building at a discount. A conversion works because the shell of the building can be worth $80 to $100 a square foot. \"The advantage of renovating is that you're getting the shell for less than replacement cost,\" says David Brint, principal and co-founder of Evanston-based Brinshore Development, which specializes in affordable projects. \"That is, in and of itself, a subsidy.\"Probably the single biggest obstacle is the size of the floor plate. Those large interior expanses that house rows of worker cubicles don't have windows and limit the amount of rentable space. Developers try to carve out atriums, but those can only work for several floors, not the entire height of the building. Most of the apartments in the Loop are studios and one-bedrooms.\"Can you convert offices to two- or three-bedroom units with multiple bathrooms to attract families?\" Ortiz says. \"I can't even imagine the cost.\"Developers will weigh whether TIF money and other incentives compensate for lower affordable unit rents. They can also benefit from generous property tax breaks adopted by Springfield lawmakers last year.Market-rate developers may team with affordable specialists who know the full range of tools available, including low-income housing tax credits, historic tax credits, and other incentives and loans. A typical project could carry eight to 10 financing sources in the capital stack. The subsidy money is allocated only to the affordable portion of the project, \"which is an exercise in creativity,\" Brint says.For his part, Reschke is considering a $180 million project to turn the top 12 floors of two towers at the former BMO headquarters into more than 300 apartments. (He's selling a third tower to the state of Illinois for its new offices.) He plans to submit a proposal to the city and says he doesn't require a partner specialist in affordable housing. \"If the subsidy doesn't make up the delta, we would look to go all market rate,\" he says.Another developer expected to be in the mix is Related Midwest, which handles market-rate and affordable projects. A spokesperson declined to discuss plans, saying only that it's \"supportive of the city's efforts to build more affordable housing in the Loop and other neighborhoods. Ensuring equitable access to housing across income spectrums is both critical to the economic vitality of communities and key to the continued success and growth of Chicago.\"Then there's the question of what level of rents can be charged for the market-rate units. Average rents in the Loop range from 33% to 50% above city averages, making the Loop inaccessible to many residents. Yet they're lower than in neighboring River North, River West and Streeterville, which could discourage investment. You can get (top) rents by Grant Park,\" Brint says. \"When you get into the core of downtown, it's another question.\"But creative developers could find a hook. Why not offer a membership to the nearby Lyric Opera of Chicago, suggests Michael Mazzei, senior vice president at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. \"You could make the neighborhood about the arts,\" he says.It wouldn't be the first time a commercial zone became a residential neighborhood. Fulton Market, once a meatpacking district, famously transformed into a trendy hub for Google and other tech companies, popular restaurants, and apartment buildings stocked with perks for singles, couples and families.A SCARCITY OF AMENITIESWill apartment renters, whether in the market-rate or affordable brackets, want to live on LaSalle Street?They will if it's an easy walk to the office, says Ben Creamer, managing broker at Downtown Apartment. \"One of the biggest factors our clients consider when moving is proximity to work,\" he says. \"Even if they aren't in the office every day, it's an important part of their search.\"Despite the stately architecture on the street, the buildings are so tall that they don't allow in a lot of sunlight, which may be a turnoff to apartment seekers. And there are few amenities. The shops and restaurants are geared toward office workers, and activity quiets down on evenings and weekends.The lack of grocery stores is one of the biggest obstacles. There are a few supermarkets on Roosevelt Road and South Halsted Street, but it could be difficult to haul a load of groceries home without a car. The city says funding assistance is available for developers providing a grocery store and locally owned cultural and dining businesses. Is it possible to carve out space for a 50,000-square-foot supermarket, or will residents have to settle for convenience stores?Life in the Loop would be a stretch for families. LaSalle Street lacks views and access to parks and the lakefront enjoyed in Lakeshore East and along Michigan Avenue, where more shops and restaurants are located. Grant Park is only five blocks to the east, but getting to the playground in Maggie Daley Park near the lake and Randolph Street is a long walk.Probably the biggest obstacle for families is an absence of schools. Elementary school students living on LaSalle Street would have to walk more than a mile to the nearest public school and cross Roosevelt Road. That's why, in the end, affordable units in the Loop will be best suited for residents who don't have children and work at downtown restaurants, hotels, government offices and health care facilities.Meeting the enormous demand for affordable housing could be accomplished more efficiently by focusing on less-expensive neighborhoods, advocates say. An estimated 160,000 units of affordable housing are needed in Cook County, according to the DePaul University Institute for Housing Studies. That's largely in North Side neighborhoods where longtime residents are being priced out.\"The city cannot bridge that,\" says Leon of the nonprofit Chicago Metropolitan Housing Development Corp. \"We need more investment in the neighborhoods working with the private sector.\"The government and legal infrastructure that supports government tax credit programs adds hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of building an affordable apartment, Leon says.For example, the process of allocating and awarding subsidies such as federal low-income housing tax credits is complex and lengthy, supported by a network of state and city administrators, lawyers and accountants.Rather than subsidize affordable units in a downtown office building at a cost of $400,000, rehabbing units in existing neighborhood buildings costs between $150,000 to $250,000 and can be accomplished without subsidies, he says.Adding affordable units in the Loop would bring valuable diversity to the neighborhood and make downtown more accessible. Will it further the revitalization of LaSalle Street? Will it make sense for developers and help bridge the shortage of affordable apartments?\"You need the right product with the right amenities for everyone,\" says Puppi at CBRE. \"Make it a place where people want to work, live and play.\"",

  "Title": "Filling vacant lots is a step in the right direction",
  "Text": "It's tough to build community\u0097a sense of neighborhood, a feeling of belonging and stability, an atmosphere of purpose and safety\u0097when your block, your street and your ward are pockmarked with vacant lots. And yet, that's just one of the challenges that's burdened entire swaths of the city's West and South sides for decades now. Those of us who don't live in, say, Garfield Park or Englewood or Lawndale may wonder why, 50-plus years after the 1968 riots that are so often blamed for the problem, there are so many abandoned lots still marring the landscape.The root causes are varied, of course. White flight and subsequent \"blockbusting\"\u0097the practice of persuading owners to sell cheaply because of the fear of \"others\" moving in nearby, and thus profiting by reselling at a higher price\u0097was certainly a factor. The years of neglect and disinvestment that followed are also part of the story, as is the history of abandonment and insurance fraud-inspired arson, which reached such a pitch in the mid-1970s that the Illinois General Assembly commissioned an eye-opening report on the trend in 1978.As any South or West side alderman, beat cop or community activist will tell you, vacant lots and abandoned buildings are a magnet for crime. They undercut the cohesion of the neighborhood. And, by limiting the number of people who actually live on a given block and call a neighborhood home, they undercut the atmosphere of community that any region must have in order to feel like a good place to live, raise kids and even run a business.So it's gratifying to see a renewed effort to help Chicagoans fill in the gaps scattered throughout the South and West sides. As Crain's Dennis Rodkin reports, City Hall has opened a new express lane to the development of housing in these areas, offering up the first round of 2,000 parcels at rock-bottom prices in an effort to spur investment and bring more people back to these communities. As Maurice Cox, city commissioner of planning and development, told the Chicago Sun-Times, a major goal of the program is to reverse the exodus of Black households from the city.Thus, the program is, quite appropriately, called \"Come Home,\" and the Lightfoot administration is touting it as a residential complement to its commercial-driven Invest South-West initiative.The 2,000 lots now listed on a new website called ChiBlockBuilder represent about one-fifth of the city's total holdings. The great majority of them originally held homes, whether houses or two- or three-flats. The effort builds on previous efforts at residential in-fill, though previous programs were generally a pretty scattershot affair and generally moved properties one at a time. All those existing programs have been rolled up into \"Come Home\" and streamlined.Before being listed on the ChiBlockBuilder website, every lot has had an environmental assessment and an independent appraisal. In the past, \"that's work you'd wait six or eight months for,\" says the City Hall official overseeing the program, Kathleen Dickhut.Each lot is listed with a market value that is specific to its micro market, Dickhut explains. Buyers who live adjacent to a property may qualify to pay one-tenth the market value. As an example, Rodkin explored the ChiBlockBuilder website and pulled up a lot on the 200 block of East 50th Street in the Grand Boulevard neighborhood. The city website lists its market value at $27,750. The price drops to $2,775 for a qualified buyer\u0097an adjacent neighbor or community group.By putting the lots up for sale with two major pieces of work\u0097the environmental assessment and the appraisal\u0097already done, the city is following the path of the Cook County Land Bank Authority, launched in 2013. The Land Bank strips red tape, such as tax liens and uncertainty in the title, off foreclosed buildings and land before re-selling them to rehabbers and developers, clearing the path to redevelopment.Bringing residents back to areas like South Shore, Auburn Gresham and Austin will be a key test of whether Mayor Lori Lightfoot's signature Invest South/West program is living up to its neighborhood-building goals. Paving the way for the people already living there to invest in their own blocks seems like a very good place to start.",

  "Title": "McDonald's opening innovation lab in West Loop",
  "Text": "McDonald's is planning to open a new innovation lab at its West Loop headquarters.The lab will focus on creating restaurant solutions and technologies, McDonald's said Sept. 14 in a news release. The roughly 120 employees from the burger giant's Innovation Center in Romeoville, which opened in 1995, will be given the option to relocate to the city. McDonald's will exit the Romeoville lease at the end of 2023.McDonald's is calling the new facility Speedee Labs. It's named for the Speedee Service System that founders\u0097and brothers\u0097Dick and Mac McDonald established in 1948, when they streamlined kitchen processes at their San Bernardino, Calif., hamburger joint and turned it into a well-oiled fast-food machine. McDonald's wants Speedee Labs to come up with innovations that will continue to get people through the line faster and drive growth.\"Our customers and restaurant teams' needs are changing, and meeting their expectations requires us to work together in new ways,\" Manu Steijaert, McDonald's executive vice president and chief customer officer, said in the news release.Speedee Labs will occupy some of McDonald's existing footprint at 110 N. Carpenter St. and lease an additional 15,000 square feet in the building. It is expected to open in phases, starting in the second half of 2023. That's also when the Romeoville employees will relocate.The Romeoville Innovation Center has offered live restaurant testing since it opened almost 30 years ago. It served as a place to test ideas from employees, franchisees and vendors. A story Crain's reported in 2006 said it tested 2,000 ideas the prior year, but only a handful made the cut. Back then, it was testing self-serve ordering kiosks and vertical grills that could cook hamburgers unattended. It tried an automatic French fry packer but tabled the idea.JOINING FORCESMore recently, the center developed or tested McDelivery, Mobile Order and Pay, and updated cooking methods, according to the McDonald's release.Even back before McDonald's relocated its headquarters from Oak Brook to Chicago in 2018, the Romeoville facility was miles away from corporate influence. Some argued that was a part of why it worked: Detachment from bureaucracy fostered more creativity. Speedee Labs will bring the innovation team together with teams from McDonald's corporate office.In the news release, Mayor Lori Lightfoot lauded the company for \"continuing to bet on Chicago.\" McDonald's said it is not receiving financial incentives for the move.Following the announcement, CEO Chris Kempczinski that same day railed on Chicago and its crime issues, calling on the city and business leaders to work together to improve public safety (see Page 4).",

  "Title": "DEVELOPERS ADAPT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING",
  "Text": "As developers draw up plans for thousands of new apartments in the West Loop, the neighborhood is emerging as a proving ground for Mayor Lori Lightfoot's push to create more affordable housing and solve one of Chicago's most intractable problems: segregation. The early signs are encouraging.In September, Chicago developer Sterling Bay broke ground on a 350-unit apartment tower in the Fulton Market District, with 20% of the total, or 70 units, set aside as affordable to people with low or moderate incomes. Later that month, Chicago-based Golub and a partner unveiled plans for a 42-story project a block away. Twenty percent, or 80, of its 400 apartments will be affordable.After grumbling for years about the city's affordable housing rules\u0097known as the Affordable Requirements Ordinance, or ARO\u0097residential developers have found a way to live with them even after the City Council passed tougher regulations last year.That's because lawmakers in Springfield also last year approved generous property tax breaks for residential projects with a 20% affordable set-aside. Combined with the state's carrot, the city's regulatory stick now works a lot better. Projects that wouldn't have made financial sense without the tax incentive do now.\"There is terrific alignment between the ARO and the state legislation,\" says Chicago attorney Rich Klawiter, partner and co-vice chair of the U.S. real estate practice at DLA Piper.It's way too early to declare victory, but the numbers are adding up in the West Loop, where developers will complete about 3,500 apartments between now and the end of 2024, with nearly 9,000 more in the planning phase, according to Integra Realty Resources, an appraisal and consulting firm.To comply with the revised ARO and qualify for tax abatements, numerous developers this year have filed zoning applications with the city for projects in the West Loop that include all 20% of their affordable units on-site. That includes a 305-unit tower that Chicago-based Shapack Partners plans at Fulton and Ada streets and a 271-unit building that Cedar Street, another Chicago developer, is proposing for the current site of Leslie Hindman Auctioneers.Golub, meanwhile, has filed plans for two West Loop projects: the 400-unit high-rise at 1234 W. Randolph St. and another one with 362 apartments at 301 S. Green St. that will include 73 affordable units.\"Without the (tax break), these deals are exceedingly difficult to pencil,\" says Golub Senior Vice President Collin McKenna.SHIFTING MOMENTUMIf the city and state programs work as intended, they could advance one of Lightfoot's biggest priorities: creating more housing for middle- and lower-income residents, including people of color, in wealthier, safer neighborhoods. So the ARO is not just an affordable housing program. Lightfoot believes it can right past wrongs, including racist housing policies.\"It is first and foremost our chief desegregation tool in the city,\" says Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara.Yet a shifting market threatens to slow or stall whatever momentum may be building. Apartment developers have had the wind at their backs the past several years, with soaring rents boosting profit margins on their projects. But rising interest rates and tougher financing criteria have already cast a chill over the market and could postpone or even kill many developments. Rent growth is slowing. High construction costs aren't helping, either.\"You've got everything working against you,\" says Jim Letchinger, founder and CEO of Chicago-based JDL Development.Under the ARO, a residential developer that obtains a zoning change or other benefit from the city for a major project must include a certain percentage of affordable units in the building. Developers have never liked the ordinance because it puts the burden of building affordable housing on them. They argue that inclusionary housing ordinances like the ARO actually make housing less affordable by discouraging residential construction. Requiring developers to include a certain amount of affordable housing in projects reduces rent they can collect. That lowers their profits\u0097and their incentive to build, developers say.But housing advocates have argued that the ARO, which was created in 2003, included too many loopholes for developers, undermining its effectiveness. For many years, for instance, developers could meet their requirement by paying \"in-lieu\" fees to the city instead of building the affordable housing themselves. The city tightened the ordinance in 2015, and Lightfoot pushed through more changes last year.DIFFERENT OPTIONSIn the West Loop today, 20% of the units in a development subject to the revised ARO must be affordable to households who earn 60% of the area median income. In Chicago, 60% works out to $62,520 annually for a family of four.Developers must include at least half the affordable units in the project and can build the rest off-site. Yet many today are choosing to build all 20% on-site. The reason: To qualify for one of the new property tax incentives, a project must meet the 20% threshold on-site.The math is compelling to JDL. The developer and a partner, Fulton Street Cos., are exploring their options for a 433-unit apartment tower at 1201 W. Fulton St.Without the tax break, \"the numbers didn't work,\" Letchinger says. \"By applying the tax savings, it gets better. It definitely gets better.\"For developers, the property tax savings offset the revenue they lose by charging below-market rents on 20% of their apartments. Under the state program, a developer that sets aside 20% of units as affordable to tenants at 60% of area median income qualifies for a 30-year reduction in the building's property tax assessments.The property's assessed value, which is used to calculate taxes, is frozen at the predevelopment level initially, so the developer does not have to pay taxes on the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars of additional property value created by the project. The assessment steps up over time, with an 80% reduction from the property's true value at year four, a 60% reduction at year seven and so on.The city is setting an even higher goal for the north end of Fulton Market, aiming for affordable units to account for 30% of all housing built north of Lake Street. But rather than mandating the 30% target for specific projects, the city is trying to achieve it through a combination of incentives and financing mechanisms, like low-income housing tax credits.One of the City Council's most vocal affordable housing advocates, Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez, 25th, also thinks the city can do better. He believes 30% affordability is attainable for some projects and aims to set the bar at that level for one pending project in his ward, at 16th and Laflin streets.\"There's a possibility to set a precedent,\" he says.While still low, the numbers are moving in the right direction. Citywide, developers have built 340 ARO units on-site this year, up from 242 last year and 213 in 2020, according to the Chicago Department of Housing. Developers of another 959 on-site affordable units have received the department's approval but have yet to break ground.The city is trying to avoid rigid requirements with its ARO, creating a variety of options that work for different projects in different neighborhoods, Novara says. Right now, however, most of the action is in the West Loop, a magnet for residential developers like Related Midwest.The Chicago-based firm is testing out the 80% market-rate/20% affordable on-site structure with a 300-unit apartment tower it's building at 900 W. Randolph St. The property's first residents will start moving in as early as April, says Related Midwest President Curt Bailey.\"We want it to be a model of how 80/20s can work in Chicago,\" he says. \"We want to do a lot more of them.\"",

  "Title": "New York and Los Angeles made a dent in gun violence. Why can't Chicago?",
  "Text": "In 2021, Chicago's homicide rate was nearly three times higher than Los Angeles', and it was more than five times higher than New York City's. Over 90% of Chicago's total homicides last year were gun-related. Despite Illinois' vigorous gun safety laws, the city's gun violence epidemic continues to pervade vulnerable neighborhoods. But now, as violent crime spills into areas previously deemed immune, will more Chicagoans show commitment to the communities most affected?Crain's spoke with two Chicago crime experts\u0097Roseanna Ander, founding executive director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, and David Leitson, embedded research analyst at the Crime Lab\u0097to discuss L.A.'s and New York's approaches to fighting gun violence, and what is at stake if the city does not fix the underlying issues. \"Los Angeles and New York had the exact same shootings as Chicago,\" Ander said. \"They did something about it.\"Here are some quick stats:* In 2021, Chicago had 29 homicides per 100,000 people, nearly triple L.A.'s rate of 10.05 and more than five times New York City's rate of 5.5, according to data provided by the UChicago Crime Lab.* The state of Illinois conducted the most firearm background checks in the country in 2021: 8.47 million in total, according to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, a database run by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is a 13.7% increase in background checks from 2020.* Cook County had 991 gun-related homicides in 2021, a 14.7% increase from 2020, according to data from the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. Approximately 82.2% of last year's victims were Black.Illinois gun safety lawsPossessing a gun\u0097legally\u0097in Illinois requires applying for and ultimately being eligible to obtain a firearm owner's identification card, which is issued by the Illinois State Police. The state police conduct a background check on each applicant through the FBI's NICS database to ensure the applicant does not have a criminal record.While the number of firearm background checks in Illinois has increased by a whopping 579.4% since 2015, Cook County\u0097and, more specifically, Chicago\u0097is still plagued with gun homicides. The city of Chicago reported in its most recent Gun Trace Report from 2017 that the majority of illegally used and possessed guns were originally obtained outside city limits, or in nearby states with less regulation: Indiana, Mississippi and Wisconsin.Gun-related homicides in Cook CountyRegardless of how or where these firearms are originally obtained, Chicago's gun violence seems insurmountable. And there is a clear start date in Chicago's increased number of homicides: Sunday, May 31, 2020\u0097the deadliest day in the city's recent history.\"The increase in gun violence really coincided with the murder of George Floyd,\" said Leitson. Of course, COVID-19 did not help matters. At the start of the pandemic, both the police and community outreach organizations were less active.But the city's violence has not improved since 2020\u0097of the 991 gun-related homicides in Cook County in 2021, 774 of them took place in Chicago ZIP codes. And Chicago's violence almost entirely impacts people of color. Nearly 82.2% of those victims were Black; approximately 13.7% were Latino.Why is Chicago's crime different?So why do the two largest cities in the U.S.\u0097New York and Los Angeles\u0097have less gun violence per capita, and lower homicide rates, than Chicago? Ander offered a plausible hypothesis:New York and Los Angeles have invested more\u0097and more consistently, in a data-driven way\u0097in an ecosystem of nonenforcement services. These outreach programs, which emphasize prevention and intervention, directly invest in communities with the highest levels of violence. These strategies have been implemented to complement the police, not replace them.\"New York had a robust and coordinated strategy to try to leverage city apparatus around making the city safe. Chicago doesn't have that kind of coordination,\" Ander said. \"Chicago hasn't been as data-driven, focused or committed into why these shootings are happening in the first place.\"Ander pointed to L.A.'s Gang Reduction &amp; Youth Development program as an effective example of nonenforcement services. GRYD provides gang prevention and intervention services in 23 designated areas of the city. The program works to prevent gang-joining among youth ages 10 through 15, and to reduce gang-embeddedness among people ages 14 through 25.However, since the COVID-19 pandemic, the city of Chicago created the Community Safety Coordination Center, or CSCC, which fights against gun-violence using data and community-driven strategies. \"CSCC and other social program investments (in Chicago) are still in their early days, though it seems like an encouraging step consistent with the non-enforcement investments and efforts of Los Angeles and New York City,\" Ander said.Ander also noted New York City's and L.A.'s improved policing as a hypothesis for lower homicide rates. \"As the accountability and progress of policing improved, community trust improved. If you can do a better job of clearance and closure, it can help break a retaliatory cycle,\" Ander said.As for the Chicago Police Department: \"We continue to see vestiges of the machine,\" Ander added, referring to the \"boss\" politics of Chicago during the late 19th and early 20th century. Promotions within the department may not necessarily reflect quality-of-work performance. \"Stepped-up investments in outreach are a step in the right direction, but we still need to improve the quality of policing.\"Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office did not respond to Crain's request to comment on steps the city is taking to establish greater trust in local law enforcement, though the mayor has recently increased her calls for new steps to beef up neighborhood-level policing and to better coordinate with other local agencies as well as federal officials to fight crime, laying out the framework of her agenda in a wide-ranging December speech.What is at stake?First and foremost, people's lives are at stake: the lives of the victims, their families, friends and community. Chicago's gun violence also has a broader ripple effect. \"Chicago is the economic engine of the region. We are all worse off if we don't have a city that's safe for everybody. It does hurt everybody,\" Ander said.The city is already seeing the repercussions from a business standpoint. In June, billionaire Ken Griffin announced his hedge fund Citadel will relocate its headquarters to Miami. Griffin often cited Chicago's increasing crime as a reason to leave.Children in violent communities are among those who suffer most. Children's school performance is inevitably affected if their communities are exposed to persistent violence, Ander said.\"These are issues happening in plain sight. There's no reason why we can't be doing more or doing better,\" she said. \"If you can't provide people with fundamental safety, it's hard to do anything else we care about as a city.\"",

  "Title": "Measuring Invest South/West without a yardstick",
  "Text": "As a candidate and as mayor, Lori Lightfoot has correctly argued there are swaths of the city that deserve greater investment\u0097and that if Chicago is ever to fix its myriad problems, from gun violence to inequitable access to health care to a lack of meaningful job opportunities for far too many Chicagoans, then more capital must flow to neighborhoods too often overlooked by Loop-centric lenders.The signature program she created to put her words into action, Invest South/West, has been up and running for three years now, and the activity it has sparked in communities starved for this kind of attention is clearly a point of pride for the mayor. It's what she has called a \"Marshall Plan\" for South and West Side corridors, and at its heart is an effort to direct $750 million in public money and resources into targeted, vacancy-ridden commercial districts, the theory being that this kind of public-sector action will spur similarly meaningful development by private-sector players.Three years isn't long enough to make the ultimate judgment on whether Invest South/West's theory is panning out. Commercial real estate development doesn't always move at that kind of pace. That said, there are signs the 11 city-backed projects that form the nucleus of the Invest South/West program are running well behind the goal set more than two years ago by the city's planning chief to have the first few buildings fully financed and under construction within 18 months. Some are efforts to turn old buildings like empty banks into apartment complexes; others are efforts to create things like commercial kitchens and cultural centers. None, so far, have broken ground. Permits await approvals. Subsidies await OKs. Zoning clearances await action.Meanwhile, some developers and neighborhood residents tell Crain's they worry that any projects that do eventually get built will only add to the list of developments reliant on public funding for life support while failing to reverse depopulation trends that have driven away a long list of national retailers. White elephants are the last thing neighborhoods like Auburn Gresham, Austin or Bronzeville need.The Lightfoot administration points to nearby developments as a sign that Invest South/West is driving momentum in communities like South Shore, North Lawndale and Humboldt Park. Lightfoot says that by the end of this year, there will have been $2 billion in combined public and private investment commitments across the 10 Invest South/West regions. But that figure includes private projects like a $50 million redevelopment of old warehouses in Humboldt Park backed by Morningstar founder Joe Mansueto as well as a $100 million Northwestern Medicine outpatient facility in Bronzeville.And while that sort of private investment is a welcome sight, it can't definitively be said that it would not have occurred without Invest South/West operating nearby. In fact, evaluating the efficacy of the program is difficult because the mayor hasn't articulated specific economic growth targets for this massive outlay of public funds. She never said how many jobs Invest South/West would create, nor how much private investment it would spark, nor how many housing units or new businesses it would spawn, nor how long it would take to produce any such gains. Instead, we are asked to believe that any investment that's happening adjacent to an Invest South/West project is an investment that's more or less flying under the Invest South/West banner.Following Crain's Sept. 22 report on the progress of the 11 projects that actually did originate with the Invest South/West nameplate, city officials pointed to a raft of developments they claim have received Invest South/West support while failing to mention that some of them\u0097Amazon's giant Pullman distribution center, for one, or the Healthy Lifestyle Hub on 79th Street, for another\u0097originated outside the program and, in some cases, even predated the program. And that may seem like splitting hairs, but when we're talking about nearly a billion dollars of public investment\u0097much of which comes in the form of tax-increment financing dollars and other forms of tax credits\u0097such details matter.",

  "Title": "Boeing's Chicago era ends with a whimper",
  "Text": "Boeing acknowledged on May 5 what some have expected for a while now: The aerospace giant intends to shift its headquarters away from Chicago in favor of the Washington, D.C., area, a decision no doubt driven in part by a desire to be nearer to federal agencies so crucial to its defense business and regulators who oversee its commercial aviation division.Though it was never publicly touted as the sole rationale at the time, Boeing's 2001 shift from its longtime home base in Seattle to Chicago was designed in part to give executives distance from local tussles with labor and to make space for them to make decisions that were controversial on the ground back in the Pacific Northwest\u0097namely, moving production of some important products to right-to-work states like South Carolina.So companies make moves such as this for all sorts of internal, strategic reasons. That said, they don't make these decisions in a vacuum, and elected officials can influence those decisions in all sorts of ways.Back in 2001, for instance, then-Mayor Richard M. Daley moved heaven and earth to win Boeing's headquarters over rivals Dallas and Denver. He understood the optical value if not the immediate jobs-driven value of drawing a global colossus like Boeing to Chicago. Boeing's arrival certified that Chicago still had a significant spot on the international corporate map\u0097a position that wasn't so secure at the time. In a single, breathtaking year\u0097starting in March 1998\u0097takeovers swept away some of the region's biggest companies and civic activists, including Amoco, Ameritech, First Chicago NBD, Waste Management, Inland Steel and Morton International.As Crain's pointed out at the time, Chicago was losing prestige, employment and its very sovereignty, as an increasing share of capital and jobs fell under the control of out-of-town interests with little or no stake in the region's long-term future.Boeing's arrival did much to reverse what felt at the time like Chicago's inevitable slide toward irrelevancy on the global corporate stage. It confirmed that Chicago had the talent, the amenities and the grit to compete, that our people could help any company grow and prosper, and that this was a region worth investing in. Yes, Boeing's headquarters was relatively small\u0097numbering in the hundreds\u0097but its presence mattered. It gave downtown Chicago a jolt of energy at a time when it was badly needed.Fast forward 20 years, and Boeing's planned departure is being greeted with a shrug. A Fortune 500 company is basically showing itself out, and public officials have offered little evidence they have done much to try to persuade its executives to stay.To be sure, it's possible Boeing would have chosen to leave even if Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot had showered the company with incentives and enticements. Fair enough. But, as Crain's columnist Joe Cahill argues in this week's issue, another of Boeing's motivations for leaving is its plan to tap the D.C. area's concentration of tech talent in order to build a research hub likely to create a lot of high-paying jobs in Northern Virginia. What does that decision say about Chicago's ability to supply that sort of workforce? What did City Hall or the Pritzker administration do to try to win at least that potential slice of Boeing's business?The answer is we just don't know. Officials at the city and state levels aren't saying much about Boeing's exit, whether they knew it was coming, or what they did to prevent it. Pressed on those questions by Crain's editorial board on May 5, two of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's chief economic lieutenants, Samir Mayekar and Jennie Huang Bennett, essentially sidestepped, talking up other corporate relocations they claim are in the pipeline.The sad irony is, Chicago still has as much to offer now as it did when Boeing first opted to come here back in 2001: world-class amenities, a gorgeous lakefront, global travel connections, solid public transit, top-flight office real estate, a well-educated and tech-savvy workforce, and a can-do spirit. Yes, there are challenges. Unfortunately, Boeing's departure will focus the world's attention on those challenges. City Hall seems to hope that won't happen. But the coverage of Boeing's move outside Chicago already suggests that hope isn't well-founded.Boeing's departure couldn't come at a worse moment for the city's downtown, which is still in pandemic-recovery mode. It's also a blow to the broader city's national and global reputation. Chicago's crime problem has been grist for headlines around the world for years now, and corruption and fiscal mismanagement are well-known nationally as well.Too bad Team Lightfoot and Team Pritzker both seem to be greeting this setback with a \"meh.\"READ FULL COVERAGE of Boeing\u0092s HQ decision at ChicagoBusiness.com/boeing",

  "Title": "Could these plans revive LaSalle Street?",
  "Text": "Painted asphalt, compelling light displays, closing off blocks for pedestrians, and even a street-sheltering glass canopy are among the ideas that could help revive vacancy-ridden LaSalle Street and boost the Loop's post-pandemic comeback, according to a city-commissioned panel.In a 36-page report, a group convened by the Urban Land Institute recommended an overhaul for the historic thoroughfare to dramatically break from its past as a hub of financial giants. The main conclusion: LaSalle Street needs to become all about foot traffic.Achieving that goal, the panel said, will take a concerted effort of city officials and property owners on the stretch of LaSalle between the Chicago River and Jackson Boulevard. After decades as LaSalle Street staples, several big banks and trading firms are leaving that corridor for newer buildings elsewhere downtown and pushing the owners of some LaSalle Street landlords into foreclosure.INCLUSIONAt the heart of the recommendation is the creation of the \"LaSalle Landmarks Innovation District,\" a distinct neighborhood that would come with a framework plan to help the street become \"a true mixed-use district inclusive of residents at different income levels and businesses of all sizes,\" the report said.That will mean repurposing much of the street's outmoded office space to cater to entrepreneurs and small- and medium-size businesses, as well as boosting residential uses on the street. More service-oriented tenants such as schools, grocery stories, medical offices, cafes and restaurants should be prioritized, as well as visitor attractions like art galleries and space for performance and immersive experiences, the report said.The panel proposed splitting up LaSalle Street into three separate zones: a northern section closer to Wacker Drive that would add to its landscaped median and signage to direct people into the heart of LaSalle; a middle zone with wider sidewalks, more streetside seating and less on-street parking; and a southern section on the two blocks north of the Board of Trade Building that would be closed off to vehicular traffic and feature a new public plaza.The plaza could be developed in phases, the report said, beginning with catenary lighting strung between light posts, seasonally changed murals on the street surface and in alleys, evening light displays projected on the surrounding buildings, and areas to sit and eat. A subsequent phase could include owners of the buildings along the two-block stretch opening up portions of their ground floors to the public with new dining options, the panel recommended, suggesting a master lease for the area with a single food and beverage operator to coordinate the offerings. The plaza could ultimately include features that would make it a destination even when the weather is bad, such as the creation of a glass canopy-like structure sheltering the street.\"Members of the (panel) believe that the bold move of pedestrianization is necessary to deliver a much-needed jolt to reenergize LaSalle Street and reshape its image as a truly desirable environment for office workers, residents, and visitors,\" the report said.The ULI panel included local developers, architects and urban planners, and was tapped for its recommendation by the Chicago Department of Planning &amp; Development and the Chicago Loop Alliance. The task was to recommend ways to draw new types of users to LaSalle and assess what role financial incentives might play in bringing that vision to life. The panel in March issued its initial findings from brainstorming sessions it held this year.INCENTIVESFinancing any of the ideas could be the biggest challenge. The report said financial incentives from the city would be crucial to getting private investors to buy into the vision, especially if any of the properties are to include affordable housing. Cook County's Class L tax designation, federal historic preservation tax credits, low-income housing tax credits and Illinois' recently passed affordable housing property tax incentive should all be leveraged to help revive older buildings, the panel said.The report also pointed to interest from some developers in revitalizing older properties, such as developer Mike Reschke's plan to redevelop the James R. Thompson Center. Reschke is also planning to purchase the tower at 115 S. LaSalle St. that BMO Harris Bank is vacating and leaving mostly empty.Funding improvements on the street itself will rely on the city unfreezing the LaSalle/Central tax-increment financing district, allowing money from that TIF to be spent for its original purpose of reviving a part of the city with severely outmoded buildings.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel made a strategic political move in 2015 when he effectively blocked new TIF spending in the central area of the city. Downtown was thriving during his administration, and the money was to be directed toward helping resolve unfunded pension costs for the city and Chicago Public Schools. That has continued thus far under Mayor Lori Lightfoot.The panel also stressed its support for a proposed bill in Springfield that would allow the formation of business improvement districts, which apply special taxes on property owners to fund street improvements, programming or services like security. The concept is similar to the commonly used special service area taxing districts in the city, but with building owners having more say over how properties within the district are assessed for purposes of the special tax. Building owners would also initiate the creation of such districts, whereas proposed SSAs are only blocked when enough property owners oppose them.",

  "Text": "Helene Gayle, former head of The Chicago Community Trust, has been appointed to the board of trustees of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.Gayle, who left Chicago in June to become president of Spelman College in Atlanta, is a Gates foundation alumna, having served as its director of the HIV, TB and reproductive health program from 2001 to 2006, the foundation said in a statement. She also spent nearly a decade as president and CEO of international humanitarian organization CARE, the statement said.Gayle started her career at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, where she spent 20 years on HIV/AIDS prevention and global health, the statement said.She was the Chicago Community Trust's first female CEO when she took the job in 2017. During her tenure, the assets of the trust\u0097one of the city's oldest and largest foundations\u0097increased from about $2.8 billion to $4.7 billion.In April 2021, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot named Gayle one of the winners of the inaugural Mayor's Medal of Honor, which honors people and organizations who contributed to the city in 2020, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\"Working at the foundation provided an important and pivotal career opportunity for me, and I am pleased to be able to give back and contribute in this way,\" Gayle said in the statement. \"The life-changing work of the foundation is a constant inspiration for me and my colleagues doing work in the social impact arena.\"The Gates Foundation statement said that in response to overlapping crises involving the COVID-19 pandemic, global economics, the climate and geopolitics, it would raise its annual giving by 50% over pre-pandemic levels to $9 billion by 2026.The foundation also named Ashish Dhawan, founder and CEO of the Convergence Foundation, to the board. Gayle and Dhawan join Strive Masiyiwa, Baroness Nemat (Minouche) Shafik, Thomas J. Tierney, Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman, and co-chairs Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates on the board.In the foundation's 2022 annual letter in late January, Suzman announced the formation of a new board of trustees, in part due to the death in late 2020 of Bill Gates Sr., Bill Gates' father, and the decision by Warren Buffett to step down in 2021.\"But it also represents an explicit recognition by Bill and Melinda, especially in the wake of their divorce, that the foundation will be well served by the addition of strong, independent voices to help shape our governance,\" Suzman wrote. \"They will bring diverse perspectives and expertise that will help to ensure the future stability and impact of the foundation.\"",

  "Title": "Developers pitch $1.2B in LaSalle St. projects",
  "Text": "Some of Chicago's best-known developers are collectively pitching more than $1.2 billion worth of projects to turn outdated office buildings on and near LaSalle Street into places to live, a key step toward what could be a historic transformation of the vacancy-ridden Loop thoroughfare.Responding to a call for such proposals from Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is dangling tax-increment financing and other public incentives to help finance them, developers submitted nine proposals for seven different properties, according to a spokesman for the department of planning and development. Among the group: Chicago-based Riverside Investment &amp; Development, which lured Bank of America to be the anchor tenant of a new Wacker Drive skyscraper, is proposing to spend $258 million redeveloping the art deco tower the bank left behind at 135 S. LaSalle St. with 430 apartments and a mix of other uses.The proposals come three months after Lightfoot unveiled a LaSalle Street Reimagined program to try to inject new life into the foot traffic-starved Loop, her boldest move to date to revitalize downtown as effects of the COVID-19 pandemic wane. With remote work weakening demand for office space and record-high apartment rents downtown, the city sought ideas from developers to revamp outmoded properties with residences and committed to help subsidize them if at least 30% of the new units created would be affordable. The goal: Creating at least 1,000 new residential units on and near LaSalle over the next five years.The deadline for submissions passed late last month. City planning officials will now evaluate the proposals and put them through a \"community engagement process,\" with decisions on which projects will win city subsidies potentially coming this spring, according to a planning department spokesman.Two proposals were submitted by Chicago developer Mike Reschke, who is betting heavily on a post-COVID Loop renaissance. He struck a deal last year to overhaul the James R. Thompson Center for Google and sell the building to the tech giant, which is expected to put thousands of its employees in the building when the project is completed in a few years.Reschke is leading a venture planning a $180 million project to convert the upper portion of the former BMO Harris Bank office building at 111 W. Monroe St. into 349 apartments and a hotel on the lower floors. Nearby, Reschke aims to turn office space above the distressed JW Marriott Chicago hotel into 280 apartments, a $130 million project. A Reschke-led venture owns the five-floor block of offices, though his lender filed a $50 million foreclosure lawsuit against his firm in 2021 alleging it defaulted on its loan. The lawsuit is still pending.Here is the full list of submissions, according to the planning department:* 30 N. LaSalle St.: A venture of Chicago developer Golub and American General Life Insurance plans 432 units (130 of them affordable) in the 43-story office tower, as well as ground -loor retail and green space and seating along Washington Street and LaSalle Street. The total cost of the project is estimated at $186 million. The proposal comes just weeks after American General Life Insurance (an AIG subsidiary) filed a $186 million foreclosure suit against the building's owner, New York-based AmTrust Realty.* 208 S. LaSalle St. (2 submissions): An affiliate of Reschke's Prime Group plans the $130 million, 280-unit conversion with 84 affordable apartments; and a venture that includes Chicago-based Sims Properties Development &amp; Management proposed a $50.2 million conversion of a portion of the building with 102 units, 30 of which would be affordable.* 135 S. LaSalle St.: Riverside Investment &amp; Development would partner with the distressed property's owner, AmTrust Realty, on the 430-unit project with 129 affordable units. Additional improvements would include up to 80,000 square feet of new lobbies, retail, food and beverage, event and cultural space and a potential fresh-market grocer. The project's estimated cost is $258 million. AmTrust was negotiating a deal last year to surrender the 1.3 million-square-foot office tower to its lender rather than face a likely lawsuit over a loan default, a move known as a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.* 400 S. LaSalle St.: Chicago real estate firm Urban Resolve proposed to turn the six-story former Cboe Global Markets headquarters building into a \"scholastic [e-sports] venue\" that includes \"226 beds for student housing,\" according to the planning department. The project would cost an estimated $104 million and include a ground-floor food court, a student mental health and wellness center and a fitness center.* 105 W. Adams St. (2 submissions):\u0097 Minneapolis-based real estate firm Maven Development Group plans a $167 million project to turn the distressed upper floors of the 41-story Clark Adams Building into 423 units, 127 of which would be affordable. The proposal does not include the Club Quarters Hotel and Elephant &amp; Castle Pub on floors 1-10.\u0097 A joint venture of Chicago developers Blackwood Group and Celadon Partners proposed 247 units in the building, with 75% of them (185 units) offered at \"affordable levels,\" according to the planning department. The submission included plans for a food market and a letter of intent from Stockyard Coffeehouse to open a location in the building. The project's estimated cost was $192 million.* 170 W. Washington St.: By far the smallest submission, a venture that includes restaurateurs and investors Scott Cochrane, Kevin Killermann and Carmen Rossi (which own the five-story office building) plan a $2 million project to convert it into four apartments (1 affordable) with new retail and commercial space.* 111 W. Monroe St.: Reschke's $180 million plan for the former BMO Harris building would include 349 units (105 of which would be affordable), as well as a hotel on the lower seven floors, a spa and fitness center, a new rooftop pool, and restaurant and basement parking.",

  "Title": "Making LaSalle Street livable",
  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot's plan to revive Chicago's Loop by reinventing the struggling business hub hurt by the pandemic as a mixed-use neighborhood hinges on convincing real estate developers that they can make money converting outmoded office buildings along LaSalle Street into apartments.While such conversions look good to builders and investors today as apartment rents downtown hit a record high and office vacancy soars, not all office buildings are well suited to be transformed into residential units, especially not the massive, sunlight-starved ones that line the historic thoroughfare. Floors in vacancy-ridden buildings like the former Bank of America offices at 135 S. LaSalle St. have lots of interior space without natural light, and lack complex mechanical, electrical, plumbing and technological infrastructure needed to make them livable.The risks of overhauling vintage buildings\u0097a process typically rife with unexpected costs\u0097may scare off some developers. And lenders may balk at financing conversions as interest rates rise and inflation drives up construction costs.Lightfoot is dangling public subsidies such as tax-increment financing money, but only if takers set aside nearly one-third of their units as affordable housing. That\u0092s higher than the 20% set-aside required by the city for most new apartment buildings.But there\u0092s a bigger challenge: turning a downtown that largely empties out after 5 p.m. into an attractive place to live. That shift would be the most significant change in the history of the city\u0092s urban core, but it\u0092s critical to sparking enough demand to yield the rents that developers need to \u00adjustify spending hundreds of millions of dollars overhauling old buildings.Converting large vintage office properties \u0093is not for the faint of heart,\u0094 says Chicago developer John Murphy, who transformed several downtown office buildings into hotels and is now evaluating office-to-residential projects downtown. \u0093You\u0092re not thinking today about what you\u0092ll likely end up dealing with as you go through the project.\u0094CRUNCHING THE NUMBERSWhether or not developers jump at opportunities to reposition LaSalle Street comes down to math. Prospective buyers would start by estimating how much they\u0092ll be able to charge for rent in converted apartments. Average net rents at high-end downtown apartments\u0097which would likely be higher quality and offer more amenities than most apartments on LaSalle\u0097were $3.64 per square foot midway through the year, according to consulting and \u00adappraisal firm Integra Realty Resources. Then a developer would calculate the cost of buying and overhauling a building. If the return on cost is better than they would get from a ground-up development elsewhere, the conversion project may be worth pursuing.Costs include purchasing the building and retrofitting it with the infrastructure and amenities needed for daily living. Experts estimate the total cost of a downtown conversion could be in the range of $250 to $300 per square foot of the building\u0092s office space, but the actual figure for any given building could be far higher, depending on the number of units and a project\u0092s particular challenges.The corridor is rife with redevelopment candidates because of its rampant vacancies, meaning investors may be able to buy buildings at steep discounts and could redo big portions of them without having to relocate smaller office users that are still there. Potential targets include office properties that are now or will soon be left with large blocks of empty space, like the 1 million-square-foot building at 231 S. LaSalle St. and the 37-story office building at 10 S. LaSalle St. The tower at 135 S. LaSalle and the majority of a 41-story building at 105 W. Adams St., whose owners have defaulted on their loans, are also considered prime candidates.But those properties are among several along the corridor with large floors spanning more than 20,000 square feet, which quickly complicates the numbers. Apartments would either have to be long, narrow units to ensure they have windows, or a developer would end up with massive hallways and unrentable space closer to the building\u0092s core. Designs in such buildings may be less \u00adattractive\u0097\u00adreducing the rents they would command\u0097and the more space in a building that doesn\u0092t generate revenue, the smaller the return when a developer ultimately sells the property.\u0093In most cases, small floor plates are better than large ones,\u0094\u00a0says Truman Tolefree, whose Rochester, N.Y.-based development firm recently bought a vintage 24-story office building with 10,000-square-foot floor plates at 65 E. Wacker Place and plans to convert most of the property into apartments.\u0091FINDING THE RIGHT CONDITIONS\u0092Many downtown office buildings that became apartments over the past couple of decades had small footprints, says Chicago Architecture Center CEO Eleanor Gorski, citing examples like the landmark Old Colony and Fisher buildings in the South Loop that are now popular for student housing.Some would-be conversions in larger buildings, meanwhile, never materialized: After developers kicked the tires on converting the former Chicago Public Schools headquarters at 125 S. Clark St. into apartments, the historic building was ultimately revamped as offices \u0093because of the difficulty in the floor plate (size) and the cost\u0094 of a residential overhaul, Gorski says.One office property that was turned into rental units at 29 S. LaSalle St.\u0097a 216-unit luxury apartment building now dubbed Millennium on LaSalle\u0097opened last year and is close to 80% leased, \u00adproviding a potential validation point for other projects. Yet it also highlighted the risk of repurposing old buildings: The developer sought to add a swimming pool and sport court on the roof, but was well into its planning work when it \u00addiscovered the 1902-built structure lacked a wind bracing system needed to support the addition, according to FitzGerald \u00adAssociates Architects Vice President Rick Whitney, the principal-\u00adin-charge of the project\u0092s design.\u0093We had to reinforce the building to do that, and it was a significant effort and cost,\u0094 says Whitney, acknowledging that unforeseen conditions typically complicate redevelopment of old buildings. Still, he says he has received \u0093some calls of interest\u0094 from developers considering LaSalle Street conversions and expects more. \u0093It\u0092s just finding the right conditions to make them happen.\u0094A spokesman for Millennium on \u00adLaSalle\u0092s developer, Florida-based DLC Residential, did not respond to a request for comment.Chicago developer Mike Reschke says there are reasonable ways around design challenges for office-to-apartment conversions, especially if a building is purchased on the cheap. A Reschke venture paid $120 million earlier this year for the largely vacant BMO Harris Bank office buildings along Monroe Street between LaSalle and Clark streets, far less than the $191 million loan the previous owner borrowed against the properties. After selling the largest tower to the State of Illinois for its new offices, Reschke is now eyeing a $180 million project to turn the top 12 floors of the 23-story and 21-story adjacent buildings into more than 300 apartments.Helping make the financials work: He plans to solve the buildings\u0092 large floor plate problem by cutting a 3,600-square-foot hole in the middle of each of the top 11 stories to create a courtyard, allowing him to build out interior-facing apartments.Reschke and other developers say public subsidies and incentives like TIF money and federal historic tax credits are critical to making conversions financially feasible, especially if projects are to include affordable units as Lightfoot hopes. Offering severely discounted rents on 30% of the units reduces the property\u0092s future income, which in turn lowers the amount of money a developer would be willing to spend on the conversion in the first place.A spokesman for the city\u0092s Department of Planning &amp; Development said in a statement that developers \u0093are already looking at luxury residential conversion projects that are viable with conventional funding sources\u0094 and that the city\u0092s push to help shoulder the financial burden is meant to ensure there are any affordable units.\u0093Without the City resources, the street\u0092s shift from a monoculture of office uses would likely lead to luxury-oriented housing investments that would be less resilient and sustainable than a mixed-income neighborhood environment,\u0094 the statement says.STIMULATING DEMANDTax sweeteners can work, as New York demonstrated in the 1990s. City officials offered dramatic property tax reductions to developers willing to acquire and repurpose older, highly vacant buildings in lower Manhattan, spurring a wave of conversions.\u0093Now it\u0092s one of the more dynamic areas with the highest density in the city,\u0094 says Nathan Berman, managing principal of New York-based Metro Loft Developers, which is working on its 18th office-to-\u00adresidential conversion in New York.Lightfoot\u0092s push to turn LaSalle Street from a corridor where 85% of commercial space is offices into a mixed-use neighborhood has one big tailwind in Google, which recently announced a plan to renovate, bring thousands of jobs to and buy the James R. Thompson Center. That move could attract more companies downtown, potentially stimulating demand for nearby housing.City planning officials are also looking for a new tool to lure more retailers to LaSalle Street and its surrounding blocks, where many have shuttered or been unable to pay rent because of remote work sapping daily foot traffic downtown. The Lightfoot administration plans to seek City Council approval to offer downtown retailers grants from its Small Business Improvement Fund.Help may be coming from Washington, too. Congress is considering a bill dubbed the Revitalizing Downtowns Act to create a new tax credit for \u00adoffice-to-residential conversions in major urban centers, provided developers commit to making at least 20% of the units affordable.",

  "Title": "LaSalle Street landlord faces a surprising foreclosure",
  "Text": "Apartments may be the solution to LaSalle Street's problems, but they couldn't save one building there from financial trouble.An affiliate of Barings has filed a $74 million foreclosure suit against the developer that converted a vintage 13-story office building at 29 S. LaSalle St. into 216 apartments a couple years ago. The developer, an affiliate of Florida-based DLC Residential, failed to pay back a construction loan on the property by its Nov. 1 maturity date, according to the foreclosure complaint.It's a surprising case because apartments stand out as one the strongest property sectors in Chicago, with few visible signs of financial distress. Many office buildings, meanwhile, are struggling, especially along LaSalle Street, the longtime heart of the city's financial district. Amid its troubles, city officials and many developers are touting office-to-apartment conversions like the one at 29 S. LaSalle as the primary strategy to revive the storied street.Yet promoters of the idea won't be able cite the project as a success story, or as a sign that people are clamoring to live in an apartment building on LaSalle Street. The occupancy rate at the property, called Millennium on LaSalle, is only 72.2%, according to CoStar Group, a real estate data provider.\"Unfortunately, during the pandemic, the Loop has really taken a big hit, and it really hasn't quite recovered,\" said Russ Krivor, former CEO of DLC.Krivor declined to discuss the foreclosure suit. He said he's no longer in charge of the property but wouldn't say who is, citing a confidentiality agreement.An attorney representing the development venture, Martin Kedziora of Greenberg Traurig, declined to comment. An attorney for Barings, David Fischer of Holland &amp; Knight, also declined to discuss the foreclosure case.UNCERTAIN FUTUREThe lawsuit, filed late December in Cook County Circuit Court, adds to a growing list of foreclosure cases involving buildings in and around LaSalle Street. Lenders have filed to foreclose on office properties at 30 N. LaSalle, 19 S. LaSalle and 105 W. Adams St. Other buildings facing loan trouble include 10 S. LaSalle, 1 N. LaSalle and 135 S. LaSalle. The most prominent symbol of the street's struggles, the Chicago Board of Trade Building at 141 W. Jackson Blvd., was recently seized by its lender.Office landlords on LaSalle Street have fallen on hard times since the pandemic began as businesses there have embraced hybrid work schedules and some big financial anchors, like Bank of America, have moved out.But the downtown apartment market has staged a full recovery from the pandemic, with rents hitting record highs last year, making the suit against the Millennium on LaSalle property all the more unexpected. With the downtown office market facing an uncertain future, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is looking to apartments as LaSalle Street's salvation. Last year, the city unveiled a plan to convert outdated office buildings on and around the street into housing. The program would include tax-increment financing and other incentives to developers that set aside 30% of the units in a converted building as affordable to low- and middle-income residents.In December, developers submitted nine proposals for seven properties eligible for the program. The city is vetting the proposals, which include a plan to redevelop the 43-story tower at 30 N. LaSalle into 432 apartments and the 1.3-million-square-foot building at 135 S. LaSalle into 430 apartments.When city officials promoted the program last fall, they cited Millennium on LaSalle\u0097the only completed multifamily conversion on the street to date\u0097as an example of a successful switch to apartments.\"It's leasing very well from our understanding and discussions with the property owner and the management folks who are there at the building,\" Cindy Roubik, deputy commissioner at the Department of Planning &amp; Development, said in an October presentation to developers.Some observers may see the failure of Millennium on LaSalle as a sign that apartment conversions can't work on LaSalle, while others may scrutinize it for mistakes to avoid. DLC was a believer in the idea back in 2015, when it bought the building for $12.9 million. Designed by Jenney &amp; Mundie, 29 S. LaSalle was known as the National Life Building when it was completed in 1902, later taking on the name of Barrister Hall.But DLC didn't really get going on the project until 2019, after it secured a $73.5 million construction loan from Barings, according to the foreclosure complaint. The load was modified twice, in October 2020 and March 2021, according to the complaint, though the document doesn't say how it was modified.Including interest and reserves, the DLC venture owes Barings $73.7 million, the suit says.INTERESTING TWISTConverting office buildings into apartments is never easy, and it's possible that cost overruns and construction glitches played a role in the building's current financial problems. DLC decided to add a swimming pool and sport court to the building's roof but discovered well into its planning that the structure lacked a wind bracing system to support the improvements.\"We had to reinforce the building to do that, and it was a significant effort and cost,\" the project's lead architect, Rick Whitney of FitzGerald Associates Architects, told Crain's last fall.In an interesting twist, the development venture owns only the building but not the land underneath it. It leases the land from its owner, the University of Chicago, according to the suit.Millennium on LaSalle opened in 2021, and its occupancy rate rose as high as 88.7% by the end of the year before dropping to 72.2% in late 2022, according to CoStar.Rents in the building range from $1,700 per month for a studio apartment to $4,213 for the most expensive two-bedroom unit, according to CoStar. The average apartment rents for $2,382, or $3.18 per square foot. To attract renters, the building's leasing agent is currently offering a month and a half of free rent to tenants who sign leases for certain units.",

  "Title": "Behind City Hall's unprecedented shot in the arm to pension funds",
  "Text": "With a property-tax snafu at Cook County pressuring already cash-short Chicago pension funds, City Hall has made an apparently unprecedented injection of more than half a billion dollars into employee retirement accounts.Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office is confirming that in recent weeks it made $574 million in \"voluntary\" early payments to funds that cover city police, firefighters, laborers and white collar workers.Those payments normally would have come from second-half city property taxes collected by Cook County, which in an ordinary year would have been due around Aug. 1. But after months of feuding between Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi and the county Board of Review, which hears appeals of proposed property-tax assessments, the bills only went out after Thanksgiving. They are for payment by Dec. 31, with distribution to the pension systems some time thereafter.DIFFICULT TIMEThat delay has threatened to squeeze the funds at a difficult time. With the funds collectively having only about 25% of the assets on hand pay promised pensions, the lack of current income from taxes could have forced them to sell investments to raise cash at a time when the stock market is still in a swoon over inflation and rising interest rates, effectively locking in their losses.That worst-case scenario now has been avoided. As first reported by Bloomberg News, the city has dipped into its accounts to pay the funds now even though the property tax income is not yet in hand.\"In the face of the delayed second installment of property taxes which put cash flow pressure on the pension funds, the city of Chicago voluntarily made an early payment of its annual contribution, rather than its standard annual practice to hold onto funds for about a year and a half until the pension contribution is paid,\" Lightfoot's office told Crain's in a statement. \"The money comes from the same annual budgeted payment, but (in 2022) the city paid it earlier to make up for delayed second-installment property tax payments and prevent liquidating assets in a down market. \"The city also is paying a portion of 2023's required pension payment early, with about $250 million to be given to pension systems on Jan. 3, Lightfoot's office said. But that payment, unlike the $574 million, was expected and approved by the City Council as part of the mayor's 2023 city budget.Officials denied the $574 million is coming out of \"reserves.\" But they are not saying if the money came out of other city accounts or has been temporarily borrowed, or if it will strain overall city liquidity.DISPUTEThe underlying property-tax dispute involves which of two different computer systems should be used to configure bills. Though the bills did go out by the end of the year\u0097avoiding tax problems for property owners on their 2022 federal income tax returns\u0097some county insiders expect the problem to persist and recur in 2023.The city, first under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel and more lately Lightfoot, has been boosting its contributions to the pension funds to the actuarially required level needed to reach a 90% funded ratio of assets to liabilities in coming decades. But that task, which has featured major increases in city property taxes, will become more difficult unless the equities market returns to positive returns.Without the advance payment, the funds would have suffered a -14.7% return on investments through November, the city says.",

  "Text": "By sidestepping a $300,000 fee, the bidding team behind a plan to bring a Bally's casino to the Chicago Tribune printing plant site bought themselves some bad optics. And the lousy look extends to the Lightfoot administration, which apparently blessed a two-for-one deal favoring one casino finalist over the others.As Crain's Greg Hinz revealed on April 20, five different investment groups submitted bids to own and operate the potentially lucrative Chicago casino. But only four paid a required $300,000 application fee to the city, a charge the Lightfoot administration says was meant to cover costs associated with evaluating the various proposals.The break went to Bally's, which offered separate bids to build the casino\u0097one on McCormick Place marshaling yards and one on the Trib site skirting the Chicago River's North Branch\u0097but only paid the application fee once.It's not as if Bally's was the only group to submit two different bids. Neil Bluhm's Rush Street Gaming, which had hoped to put a casino at Lakeside Center on the McCormick Place campus, paid $300,000 for that application as well as for its separate proposal to build a casino on Related Midwest's The 78 property. The Lakeside Center idea was rejected, but The 78 proposal made it onto the mayor's shortlist of three finalists for the casino license.With the Lightfoot administration's final decision on who wins this coveted license rumored to be coming down within weeks if not days, the question looms: Why were the two double-bidders treated differently?None of the rationales offered to Crain's by people close to the situation really add up.\"In the case of Bally's, it was the same applicant and same ownership group that was proposing an alternate site,\" an administration source who asked not to be named told Hinz. \"In the case of Rush Gaming, there were two different applicants with different ownership groups in each application.\"That's true. At McCormick Place, Rush Street partnered with Farpoint Development, and at The 78 with Related. However, Farpoint is the lead on developing the old Michael Reese Medical Center property. Related, of course, has faced a fair bit of City Hall scrutiny on its path to approval of The 78 project. Both firms were extensively vetted by the city before they applied for the casino opportunity.And while Bally's proposed the same ownership structure, there were considerable differences between its proposals. In the case of the Tribune pitch, Bally's has an option to buy the property, just as a for-instance. No such deal was in place at the McCormick marshaling yards site Bally's had been eyeing.The application fee kerfuffle is only the latest in a series of events that give outside observers reason to wonder if the casino selection process is going to be as fair and above-board as it ought to be. If Chicago is to have a casino, its taxpayers deserve to feel assured that the winning bidder got the prize for the right reasons\u0097and that no one inside City Hall has his or her thumb on the scale. That shouldn't be too much to ask, even in Chicago.",

  "Title": "On casino deal, Lori channels her inner Rahm",
  "Text": "Four years ago, when she was running for the first time, Lori Lightfoot promised to be a different kind of mayor than Rahm Emanuel was\u0097one who would listen and not dictate, one who would transparently involve citizens in the decisions that affect them, rather than being a Chicago-style boss pushing a pre-set agenda.Since then, Lightfoot apparently has had an epiphany.With her decision to shoehorn a proposed casino into a crowded River West neighborhood, despite enormous local opposition and despite the fact that viable alternative locations exist, Lightfoot is channeling her inner Rahm. She may well get what she wants\u0097most mayors do, and Chicago does need a casino somewhere. But she's become what she campaigned against.It's been clear for a while that, for whatever reason, the Bally's Tribune proposal was always tops in her mind.First, her team let Bally's quietly drop a clause allowing it to unilaterally buy out its minority investors, a clause that may well have disqualified any other bidder. Then it excluded a site at the east end of the McCormick Place campus that had a lot of merit and wouldn't be in anyone's backyard. Thereafter we learned Bally's got a two-for-one deal on an application fee that saved it $300,000, and that the city consultant who gave Bally's the highest financial marks was co-manager on a $696 million Bally's stock offering last year.Now, says the mayor, Bally's offers the best financial deal and the kind of well-paying jobs Chicago needs. But is that the whole story?According to a report the city issued as part of the mayor's Bally's announcement, Bally's will pay the city a projected $2.684 billion in financial incentives over the next 50 years. But two other bidders, Hard Rock and Rivers 78, would pay $2.67 billion and $2.662 billion each, respectively. That's a difference of $14 million and $22 million, not even a rounding error, given that no one really know what's going to happen over 50 years.It gets better. Those estimates are based on projected gambling revenue at each of the three finalists. And the gambling revenue projections came from the company I referenced above, Union Gaming, whose analytics unit worked for Bally's on that stock offering. Moreover, the bid from Rivers had an escalator clause that actually could pay the city more than Bally's if the Chicago casino turns out to be really popular.Rivers, owned by Chicago casino mogul Neil Bluhm's Rush Street Gaming, also comes out higher on jobs, according to the city's own report. The city estimates the Rush Street proposal to build the casino in the South Loop would create 3,425 permanent jobs, well over Bally's 3,000. Asked about that differential, city officials suggested the Rush Street jobs wouldn't be as good as Bally's, but provided absolutely no proof.The mayor also has talked about the long and deliberative process her administration has followed in coming up with a casino finalist. One in which neighborhood folks have had an equal seat at the table.Really? The city has had one\u0097count 'em, O-N-E\u0097public hearing in the River West area since it was named a casino finalist. And that hearing (I listened to every word) was more sales job than hearing, with residents free to discuss their views only at the tail end of a three-hour gathering.Now, Lightfoot wants the City Council to vote for Bally's just two weeks and couple of days from now. And she's promising another public session\u0097one public session\u0097at which residents can question the casino company and state their views. Where is it? At the University of Illinois Chicago's West Loop campus, miles away from River West. But that's the apparent goal. Hold it somewhere difficult to get to for opponents, so the mayor's forces can more easily stack the crowd with organized supporters.One other thing: Despite strong indications previously that the temporary casino would go to the Sheraton Grand Chicago Hotel, the facility, up to 800 gambling positions and big crowds are now headed\u0097voila!\u0097to the Medinah Temple on North Wabash Avenue. I suspect that won't go down very well with nearby residents, but I don't know for sure because the city hasn't held even one public hearing on the idea.\"It is clear to me that the administration officials who vetted and approved this proposal lack a fundamental understanding of neighborhood context and the day-to-day reality that already exists in that part of River North,\" says the area's alderman, Brendan Reilly. \"It's also pretty clear that the legitimate objections raised by thousands of downtown residents are being ignored.\"Of course, in theory, the City Council could say no. Reilly and some others will urge just that. But Lightfoot has neatly co-opted them, for instance, luring organized labor by setting up a paradigm that this is a choice between wealthy North Siders and hungry job seekers when, in fact, other options are available. As a result, that special review committee headed by Ald. Tom Tunney, 44th, has held one meeting. And now it will get to \"evaluate\" a final package with Bally's negotiated by the mayor. In other words, be a good little rubber stamp.Like I suggested above, Chicago does need a casino and tax revenues it will spin off. And likely any decision to locate it anywhere would irritate someone. Sometimes a mayor needs to make a tough call.But Lightfoot promised to be different, someone who didn't browbeat aldermen and ram through what she wanted before voters could block it. Somehow, I suspect that even the real Rahm would blush at this turn of events.READ FULL COVERAGE of the Chicago casino selection process at ChicagoBusiness.com/casino",

  "Title": "A much-needed effort to curb 'street takeovers'",
  "Text": "As if Chicago didn't face enough of a challenge in reversing a reputation for lawlessness, along comes the rise of so-called street takeovers\u0097dangerous and illegal gatherings organized in minutes via social media.As the Chicago Sun-Times vividly chronicled earlier this month, street racers and stunt drivers have built up a devoted underground following, and they and the crowds they attract spend weekend nights roving the city for opportunities to shut down intersections or thoroughfares to strut their stuff in souped-up cars\u0097sometimes drag racing, sometimes \"drifting\" in tight circles with passengers hanging out the windows, sometimes doing donuts, as onlookers chronicle the action on ever-present cellphone cameras.By setting up informal barricades, street racers and their fans close off access to spots all around the city: Clinton and Monroe, 119th and Halsted, Cermak Road and Lumber Street, even the Eisenhower Expressway near Rush University Medical Center. Making matters worse, the onlookers can get unruly, clashing with police, throwing rocks, bricks and bottles, shooting off fireworks and, in at least one reported incident, driving their cars toward police officers in an attempt to run them down.The Aug. 28 death of a pedestrian crossing Cicero Avenue near Midway Airport\u0097struck by drivers who are believed to have been drag racing, weaving and careening through traffic\u0097brought things to a new level and underscored the need to take stronger action to bring this street racing culture under some sort of control.Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot says she believes social media companies are a major contributing factor to the rise of street takeovers. \"Their failure to be proactive in addressing these issues, to work proactively with law enforcement, is an absolute abomination. I'm one who believes that the federal government has to step up and regulate every single one of these platforms. Whether it's selling guns on social media brazenly and openly,\" she said at an Aug. 29 press conference, \"there is a whole marketplace of illegal activity that is going on every single day on social media and these social media companies absolutely have the ability to regulate what's happening on their platforms.\"While the mayor may have a point, there's little likelihood any sort of federal social media regulation is in the offing, which means the immediate responsibility for quite literally curbing street racers falls on her and her police chief. The so-called caravan task force formed this summer to prevent street takeovers hasn't yielded much in the way of arrests and vehicle seizures. Police have struggled to respond to these incidents, often appearing to be caught flat-footed as crowds form. Clearly, law enforcement needs better tools to keep the city's streets safe and open.A measure introduced in late August by state Rep. La Shawn Ford seems to be the right step in the right direction. His latest legislation turns up the volume on a previous bill, which he sponsored, that goes into effect in January. Under that law, drivers involved in street takeovers and those who block traffic for car stunts will face a minimum fine of $250 and a misdemeanor charge that could result in a prison sentence of less than a year. If they're caught again, they'll face a Class 4 felony and a minimum fine of $500.Ford's newest measure would give officials the power to charge street racers with mob action, a Class 4 felony that carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. Onlookers who take part in violent disturbances would face the same charge.That's the sort of consequence that could make Chicago's street cruisers think twice before revving their engines\u0097and recklessly endangering the lives of those around them. Ford's measure deserves swift passage into law.",

  "Title": "In this NASCAR race, transparency loses",
  "Text": "It's an idea that has a certain gee-whiz appeal, at least at first: NASCAR racers speeding past Chicago's iconic lakefront, offering TV-ready, panoramic skyline vistas to fans nationwide while potentially drawing thousands of visitors to a city in need of an image makeover and a healthy shot of tourism.Amid the swirl of logo-festooned cars and the roar of souped-up engines, however, it's easy to be distracted. At least that seems to be what Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her team were counting on as they rolled out a plan to bring NASCAR racing to Chicago's Grant Park for three consecutive Fourth of July weekends starting next year. The deal as first described on July 19 was long on \"wow\" and short on the sort of details the taxpaying public is entitled to know.Here's what the Lightfoot administration and NASCAR officials were willing to tell us from the get-go:The 12-turn, 2.2-mile course will include South DuSable Lake Shore Drive, East Jackson Drive, East Balbo Drive and East Roosevelt Road, with the start and finish lines on South Columbus Drive in front of Buckingham Fountain.\"This is actually going to be our first race on a street course in our 75-year history,\" a NASCAR honcho said in the initial announcement. \"I think it's going to be a very unique course.\"OK. Then came the hard part: finding out how much this whole affair is going to cost, how the parties involved will deal with safety issues as well as potential damage to public infrastructure and the park itself, and what, if anything, the city will ultimately stand to make off of the deal.Extracting this kind of information from City Hall has proved to be an obstacle course of its own. It wasn't until July 28 that Crain's was able to report that the race will have a wider and longer impact on the downtown than previously disclosed, one that will effectively tie up the city's premier park for two full weeks.In a statement to Crain's, the Chicago Park District said the permit it issued for activities surrounding the race will cover all of Grant Park, from Roosevelt Road north to Randolph Street, not just the area in which the race will occur south of Jackson Drive. And though the race is scheduled for July 1 and 2, the permit will cover 14 days, from June 22 through July 5.As for the city's take, the statement says the park district's compensation \"includes a permit fee of $500,000 plus 15% of net commissions on concession and merchandise plus $2 per admission ticket sold.\" And did the park district board have any say over this plan? The statement indicates Lightfoot &amp; Co. are stretching a district loophole to the breaking point, arguing that, per district code, \"agreements that generate revenue do not require board approval.\"Among other questions that remain unanswered: what compensation the city will get for use of its streets, how long major thoroughfares such as DuSable Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue will be closed, and whether the deal will be submitted to the City Council for approval.So there you have it: We're committed to host a major, multiyear event that will tie up most of the downtown lakefront and, no doubt, disrupt traffic in the Loop for two weeks at unknown cost for unknown revenue. No one beyond the mayor's closest advisers, her appointed civic boosters and park district brass seems to have had any insight into the terms of the deal or its potential impact on publicly owned land and infrastructure. Transparency? It's simply not in Team Lightfoot's vocabulary.At least one alderman\u0097Brendan Reilly, whose ward covers most of the downtown area\u0097is crying foul, saying he will push for aldermen to reclaim the power to approve or reject special events such as the NASCAR race. \"When this privilege was granted to the executive branch by the City Council, nobody envisioned the mayor would use those powers to skirt transparency and exclude local aldermen and their constituents from key decision-making processes,\" Reilly wrote in an email to Crain's. \"The mayor has abused that privilege.\"That may be so. But at least as far as this NASCAR event is concerned, Reilly's outrage may be too little, too late. Lightfoot, it seems, has already waved the green flag on this one.",

  "Title": "REVITALIZING NEGLECTED REAL ESTATE",
  "Text": "Ocie Windham has leased apartments in the South Shore and Chatham neighborhoods for more than 30 years. He keeps the rents affordable and maintains occupancy at 95%. But with rising real estate prices\u0097in part to due to speculation surrounding the development of the Obama Presidential Center\u0097he's tempted to sell more of his 100 units.If he does, it would be unfortunate for the neighborhood. Out-of-town owners who have been buying up property in South Shore often lack on-site management and haven't been quick to tend to tenant concerns. \"I hear from tenants in the buildings I sold and they curse me out,\" Windham says. \"They want to rent from me because they see me one or two times a month, and my janitors are around all the time.\"At a time of intense interest in revitalizing Chicago's predominantly Black neighborhoods and the housing stock, building wealth and providing a path to homeownership, deep-rooted market conditions stand in the way.The announcement of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park has attracted speculative buying and fears of gentrification that could displace residents. Yet much of South Shore awaits to be transformed. Whether outside investors are discovering rental income doesn't support the high prices they paid and there's little money left for upkeep, or whether they deliberately are milking their properties, the result is the same.\"Outside investors aren't maintaining the properties the way they should,\" says Tonya Trice, executive director of the South Shore Chamber of Commerce. Trash piles up and repair requests go unanswered. Some landlords have stripped buildings of their architectural distinctiveness, Trice says. Storefronts on 71st Street and other commercial corridors sit vacant because property owners can capitalize on tax breaks while they wait for gentrification.On the West Side in North Lawndale, community organizers have ambitious plans to build hundreds of affordable homes but struggle to line up low-cost construction loans. A partnership of United Power for Action &amp; Justice, the Lawndale Christian Development Corp. and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives raised $12.5 million to start construction but needs to double that amount so it can reach a critical mass of 100 homes. \"We need the banking and philanthropic organizations to contribute so we can build at scale,\" says Richard Townsell, executive director of Lawndale Christian.Experts say better access to credit is needed to enable landlords and homeowners to upgrade properties. Housing advocates say loans and grants from American Rescue Plan Act funds can be channeled to small operators for building upgrades in a simplified, streamlined process. Shared ownership, in which local residents pool their capital to acquire property, could be a way to return control to the neighborhoods, activists say.\"We used to build housing for working people, and we don't do that anymore,\" says Nick Brunick, an attorney at Applegate &amp; Thorne-Thomsen who specializes in affordable housing.UPGRADING TWO-FLATSThe South Shore neighborhood is known for its variety of distinctive architectural styles from the early 20th century, including Prairie School and art deco. Like other South Side neighborhoods, South Shore saw a demographic shift from 90% white in the early 1960s to 94% Black by 1980.Entrepreneur Alisa Starks recalls that when her family moved into South Shore in 1965, \"we got dressed up to go to 71st Street.\" Students in her kindergarten class were mostly white, but that reversed by the time she got to eighth grade. \"Property owners left, businesses left, there was instant devastation,\" she says. The median income in 2019 was $34,215, according to IHS Data Clearinghouse, compared with $60,438 for all of Chicago. One-third of the population is below the poverty line, as compared with 18.4% for Chicago, according to the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.To the southwest, the Chatham neighborhood also experienced white flight, but it evolved into a middle-class African American area, home to famous businesses that include Johnson Products and Seaway Bank. The population has declined from a 1970 peak, and the businesses were sold. Median income in 2019 was $38,208, according to IHS Data, and nearly 27% live in poverty. It has relatively more single-family homes compared with South Shore.These neighborhoods have what analysts call \"naturally occurring affordable housing.\" That is, they've yet to encounter the gentrification of neighborhoods like Logan Square and Albany Park, where rising rents threaten to displace longtime residents and there's demand for subsidized housing to keep housing costs affordable.In South and West Side neighborhoods, the challenge is how to upgrade the thousands of two-flats, four-flats and small apartment buildings, says Stacie Young, executive director of the nonprofit Community Investment Corp., or CIC, which finances the acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. Most of the country's affordable housing, about 70%, isn't subsidized, Young says. Those naturally affordable rental units are no longer viable when owners don't maintain them. Better to invest in repairs rather than let buildings deteriorate to the point where they have to be demolished and rebuilt with new construction that costs $250,000 to $300,000 per unit, she says.Revitalizing a neighborhood, of course, requires a holistic approach that also improves commercial streets. \"I wouldn't buy a house if I have to walk past an abandoned building to get there,\" says Ja'Net Defell, who leads Community Desk Chicago, an initiative of The Chicago Community Trust in partnership with the Boston Consulting Group and JPMorgan Chase Foundation. \"You need to stabilize the corridors while you're building the houses.\"Anticipating rising real estate values as a result of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park, outside investors have bought into struggling condo buildings and converted apartments to luxury rentals, displacing residents. At one renovated building, Park Heights by the Lake, advertised rents are $1,500 or more for a one-bedroom apartment, with a one-bedroom penthouse listed at $3,600 or more.Housing advocates say the city should provide protections like those in nearby gentrifying Woodlawn, such as affordability requirements for housing built on city-owned lots.But South Shore isn't yet a gentrification hot spot. In the northern part of the neighborhood, just south of Jackson Park, sit vacant and abandoned buildings. \"Some of the buildings are encumbered with debt,\" says Chicago Housing Commissioner Marisa Novara. \"It's not our goal for out-of-town investors to maximize profits on these buildings.\"Leon Stenneth, a South Side entrepreneur, in the past two years has purchased two buildings in Chatham that were owned by out-of-town investors. There were problems with the boiler and the roof, and the hallways hadn't been painted in more than 10 years, he said. \"They were not in the best shape,\" he added. Stenneth, who also has a job in tech as an artificial-intelligence engineer, painted the common area, made the repairs and added laundry facilities. Even with charging affordable rent of $800 to $1,000 for a one bedroom, there's room to keep up the buildings, make a profit and build wealth, he says.Out-of-town investors aren't the only problem. Tenant complaints have been directed at Pangea Properties, a Chicago real estate investment trust that's one of the largest landlords in South Shore and Chatham. \"There are growing concerns around management, upkeep of the buildings and the eviction rate of South Shore residents,\" says Trice at the South Shore chamber.In response, Pangea CEO Peter Martay said the REIT has spent $400 million of private capital over the past 13 years rehabilitating properties in underserved neighborhoods. Pangea's investments have turned often vacant buildings with code violations into safe and affordable apartments, Martay wrote in an email.Another problem in South Shore are the empty storefronts on 71st Street and other corridors. State law enables property owners with vacant storefronts to get a break on property taxes, so they keep the spaces unleased, awaiting gentrification and higher rents, Trice says. \"We have business owners interested in opening stores, but there is a shortage of viable inventory,\" she says. A lack of restaurants and other amenities discourages renters. Trice and other community leaders are advocating for changes to the law.AMBITIOUS PLANS IN NORTH LAWNDALEDifferent roadblocks exist on the West Side in North Lawndale, where nonprofit organizations plan to build single-family homes, providing not just comfortable and affordable housing but a path to build family wealth.The North Lawndale neighborhood also suffered from white flight and then rioting and looting after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Iconic companies subsequently left the area, including International Harvester and Sears. Median income, according to IHS Data, was $31,611 in 2019, and 38% of the neighborhood's population live in poverty.As many as 3,000 city-owned vacant lots are ripe for a wide-scale housing development. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who restarted an earlier initiative, last year announced the city would sell 250 of the city-owned lots for $1 each to the coalition of United Power for Action &amp; Justice, Lawndale Christian Development and Chicago Neighborhood Initiatives that is developing the housing. The city also allocated $5.3 million in tax-increment financing money to prepare the sites.Illinois is providing the North Lawndale consortium $10 million in subsidies to help homebuyers with their down payments. The partnership has marketed the homes to churches, nonprofits, renters and the children of area homeowners. Townsell says there's a waiting list of prospective buyers.The partnership has raised $12.5 million in revolving construction loans, which will enable it to start construction on a first group of 23 homes. The partnership, however, is seeking another $12.5 million in order to fund 100 homes at $250,000 each.Chase provided a $2.5 million grant, Townsell says, adding that the bank was embarrassed by a 2020 WBEZ report showing that between 2012 and 2018, 80% of its mortgages were made in white-majority neighborhoods, compared with 2% in Black and 5% in Latino communities. Foundations and wealthy individuals have provided zero-interest loans, and Townsell says he hopes an additional four or five banks will offer low- or no-interest financing to keep the home prices affordable.\"The banks say they can't do it at zero,\" he says. \"What can they do it at? The banking and philanthropic community should put money where their mouth is.\" For the long term, the coalition seeks to develop 1,000 of the 3,000 city-owned lots. If successful, the project could be a model for Pullman, Chicago Lawn and other communities with ample vacant land.TESTING SHARED OWNERSHIPLarger, well-established developers are deft at using government subsidies for affordable housing. But it can be difficult for owners with limited resources to navigate complex rules. The Preservation Compact, a coalition of public and private organizations with a stake in housing preservation that is based at the CIC, is working to see whether American Rescue Plan Act funds can be used to rehab older rental buildings without subjecting small entrepreneurs to mountains of paperwork, Young says. Small operators could possibly band together to gain economies of scale in purchasing services from insurance brokers and building tradespeople, she adds.The Preservation Compact last year was successful in pushing the Illinois General Assembly to adopt an incentive to maintain affordable housing by offering reductions in a property's assessed value.The Chicago City Council recently adopted an ordinance that relieves city debt on vacant and abandoned properties in low- to moderate-income communities that have the opportunity for rehabilitation and reoccupation. \"If debt like a past-due water bill is an obstacle to a building being redeveloped, we'll erase that,\" says Novara. And the Building Department last year relaxed its plumbing code to expand the use of plastic pipe, which is less expensive than traditional cast iron.Nonprofit leaders are waiting to see if, and how, banks liberalize their guidelines to make capital more accessible to developers, building owners and homebuyers.Philanthropy will continue to play an important role. Billionaire MacKenzie Scott in March announced a $436 million donation to Habitat for Humanity, including $6 million to chapters in the city and suburbs. A spokeswoman for the Chicago chapter said funds will be used to strengthen programs in West Pullman, Greater Grand Crossing and Austin.One experiment underway in South Shore is testing the potential of shared ownership. In 2020, a group of 27 residents from the Jackson Park Highlands section pooled their money to buy and rehab a troubled building with 16 apartments and five ground-level commercial spaces.Residents of disinvested neighborhoods often are alienated because they lack ownership and control of local buildings and businesses, says entrepreneur Michael Kelley, a leader on the shared ownership project.Kelly and others hope their model can be replicated on a larger scale, but they acknowledge that requires a lot of community education and coordination.\"We want to pull resources together so we can acquire some of these buildings and maintain the legacy of South Shore,\" says Trice at the South Shore chamber. \"We're known for our properties, lakefront and golf courses. We need investors that respect the culture of the community.\"",

  "Title": "Lakefront plan has merit\u2014but not for the Bears",
  "Text": "It's possible to look at the Lightfoot administration's proposal to revamp the Museum Campus via two separate lenses. Through one lens, it's too little, too late. Though another, it's a promising set of ideas that could create new, greener public space that's more accessible for the entire city.As for the first lens: If the plan is designed to keep the Chicago Bears from abandoning their longtime lakefront home in favor of a shiny new stadium in Arlington Heights, then it appears to be a few yards short of a touchdown.Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Museum Campus Working Group on July 7 unveiled recommendations that include putting a dome atop Soldier Field, likely a $1 billion-or-more endeavor, though the group offered no details about how such a structure would be funded. The report also observed that seating, concourses, restrooms and other amenities at the stadium are in line for some major upgrades. \"To better utilize Soldier Field year-round,\" the report stated, \"the city should also explore the feasibility of enclosing the stadium.\"As Crain's Greg Hinz noted, there was one wording change from the previously reported draft of the group's recommendations, which suggested there is no way a dome would pay for itself and that it would have to be subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, says the report's final version: \"Although enclosing Soldier Field would incur significant investment, further analysis is required to fully understand the specific costs, the potential direct and indirect economic impacts, and the full range of potential funding sources available to determine options that are respectful to Chicago taxpayers.\"A few hours after the group's final recommendations were released, the Bears issued a cautious, carefully crafted statement: \"The only potential project the Chicago Bears are exploring for new stadium development is Arlington Park. As part of our mutual agreement with the seller of that property, we are not pursuing alternative stadium deals or sites, including renovations to Soldier Field while we are under contract. We have informed the city of Chicago that we intend to honor our contractual commitments as we continue our due diligence and predevelopment activities on the Arlington Heights property.\"As formal statements go, this one seems to offer very little hope that the Bears would finagle their way out of their Arlington Park deal even if they wanted to. So it's probably safe to say any Soldier Field redo is a nonstarter for the Bears\u0097and, if that's the case, there's little reason to erect a costly dome over a gussied-up Soldier Field. If the Bears could have been persuaded to stay, Lightfoot seems to have missed her chance. Spending money on a dome now would be throwing good money after bad.There is, however, another way to look at her working group's broader vision for the Museum Campus. Setting the Bears aside, the ideas being floated for the rest of the lakefront space have merit\u0097though the administration will have to answer some tough questions about how to pay for it all. Among other things, the working group proposes \"rewilding\" Northerly Island, where Meigs Field used to be, by relocating the music pavilion on the island's north end, possibly to the lawn between Soldier Field and the Field Museum. The report also suggests construction of a new pedestrian bridge to ease access to Northerly Island which, if reshaped as the working group imagines it, could become a rare space along Chicago's downtown lakefront where one could sit and enjoy some native greenery and waterfront vistas without the roar of Lake Shore Drive in the background.Other interesting ideas in the report: improving bike paths, restoring a trolley or mini-bus for internal circulation, creating a Great Lakes Climate Lab to be centered on Northerly Island and expanding water taxi service to the area. The report also calls for \"adaptive reuse\" of Lakeside Center at McCormick Place, though few details of what that means are on offer just yet.All in all, what Lightfoot &amp; Co. have put on the table is a promising set of proposals that are worth exploring even if the Bears won't be at the middle of it all. Would these ideas have made a difference to the Bears if they had come up sooner? Probably not. But that doesn't mean the rest of us can't benefit from some of the proposals to create a greener, easier-to-access and livelier Museum Campus.",

  "Title": "Proposed grocery stores, artists' cafe win latest city grants",
  "Text": "A long-anticipated grocery store under the Wilson el stop. A chain of grocery stores on the South and West sides. An artists' work space and cafe in Woodlawn.Those are among the big winners of the latest round of Community Development grants from the Lightfoot administration that will support investment in mostly minority and low-income neighborhoods.Overall, the round announced on July 18 involves nearly $50 million in tentative awards that, if projects actually are completed, is paired with another nearly $50 million in private investment.The most eye-catching are a dozen projects that each will get at least $250,000.The single largest at any one location is $5.2 million toward completion and opening of the proposed Chicago Market co-op grocery store at 4620 N. Broadway.The facility has been empty since the stop on the Chicago Transit Authority's el line was completed several years ago, with store organizers trying to come up with financing. Under the plan announced on July 18, the city's money will go toward a project that overall will cost an estimated $11.7 million.The Yellow Banana chain will be taking over five Save-A-Lot stores on the South and West sides and reopening one that recently closed. The city said Yellow Banana will get $13.5 million overall to spread among work at the six sites.Among other projects in line for help is an artists' space and cafe at 525 E. 67th St., which has been allotted $1.2 million, and the CircEsteem conversion of a former theater at 4730 N. Sheridan Rd. into an entertainment venue and social services center. According to the city, it will get $4.2 million, about half of total project costs.Sixty-three other groups were selected for awards of up to $250,000 each. The entire list is posted on the city's website.Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement, \"When our local entrepreneurs have the tools they need to grow their small businesses, they can thrive and make our neighborhoods that much more livable, functional and enjoyable.\"Money for the projects come from development fees paid on some projects in the central area of the city and, in some cases, tax-increment financing revenue.",

  "Title": "Why crime didn't pay on the campaign trail",
  "Text": "As Chicago pivots from one election to another, one of the better questions out there is why the volatile crime issue didn't help Republicans more\u0097and if that means easy going for Mayor Lori Lightfoot despite steep hikes in crime rates on her watch.GOP candidates and their allies, of course, used crime as an emotional wedge issue at almost every opportunity in the just completed Illinois general election campaign. If it wasn't House GOP Leader Jim Durkin griping about no-bail release and other alleged flaws in the SAFE-T criminal justice reform law that will take effect on Jan. 1, it was conservative strategist Dan Proft running ads that showed a woman being mugged in front of her own home or gubernatorial nominee Darren Bailey calling Chicago a \"hellhole.\"Needless to say, it didn't work. Durkin lost at least four House seats and is stepping down as leader. Proft didn't win a single race in which his People Who Play By the Rules PAC spent wads of packaging mogul Dick Uihlein's money. Bailey grabbed all of 16.45% of the vote in Chicago, according to near-final, unofficial returns, and got clocked in the suburbs, especially DuPage County.So, what happened?Durkin candidly concedes he was \"surprised\" and called polling that suggested crime would be a big issue \"wrong.\" He theorizes that many voters, particularly in the suburbs, were motivated by other issues, notably abortion rights. That almost certainly is part of the answer.Proft, in an equally candid email, offers a couple of theories.The first: \"Making personal safety the referendum question was the best play we had. It put Pritzker (and Lightfoot) on defense the entire race. It kept him focused on me rather than Bailey and it had the added benefit of broad bipartisan opposition\u0097prosecutors, judges, sheriffs, et al.\" So it worked, up to a point.However, he continued, \"At the end of the day, as in New York, there are not enough motivated voters, to the extent they exist at all, to make a change even with broad agreement on an issue that was essentially even with abortion in terms of animating votes (per a lot of polling).\" Or as he put it earlier in the email, \"Many of those Rs you think are in the suburbs aren't. And many who are left are either fatalistic\u0097about a lot more than Bailey (see the congressional and leg(islative) races)\u0097or cowered into inaction by the Leftist mob's vilification.\"Whew! Democratic strategists I talked to likely would point to that mix of strong feelings and blaming the voters as the reason why the crime strategy didn't work.Proft \"doesn't do meaningful research on voters and tailor messaging to it. He just figures out what will make Dick Uihlein get his rocks off,\" says Tom Bowen, who currently is working for Lightfoot. \"Voters have competing priorities. You can't just say 'crime, bad. BOO!' and hope that works if you don't credibly put forward a plan as an alternative. Also, you can't divorce that from what's going on elsewhere.\"But Proft points to one other thing he's right about. Though the blue tide was wide on Election Day, in Chicago, it was narrow\u0097with total turnout likely to end up no more than 45%, the lowest for a gubernatorial race in at least 20 years.All of that suggests the crime issue can move people, arguably more in a mayoral race in which people associate law-and-order issues with the city head more than they do with a governor. \"Where are the cops?\" is a much easier issue to get your arms around than the intricacies of SAFE-T or whatever you call that bill.\"I think crime will dominate the municipals,\" says another Democratic consultant with city clients, Becky Carroll. In fact, \"In all likelihood, the polling will show that this is the No. 1 issue across the city.\"So, maybe it's the messenger rather than the message? I'd be shocked if crime isn't an enormous issue here this winter. But I've been wrong before. They don't call politics an art, not a science, for nothing.",

  "Title": "NASCAR bets Chicago will fuel its turnaround",
  "Text": "After a decade of dwindling relevance, NASCAR is looking to Chicago for a jump-start.The stock car racing circuit's street race around Grant Park next July will be its boldest move yet in a broader effort to re-enter the mainstream sports conversation with a younger, more diverse crowd. Instead of staging the first such event in its 75-year history in a NASCAR stronghold, the sport's leaders are about to spend more than $50 million\u0097among its largest outlays ever for an event\u0097on a first-of-its-kind track in the middle of an urban center where it has historically struggled to gain traction.\"Our focus on this event is to drive interest and awareness (to) reach new fans,\" says Julie Giese, president of NASCAR's Chicago Street Course.It's no secret as to why: NASCAR has to change something to rebuild its audience. Its average national TV viewership has shrunk to just over 3 million people per race, barely half of its size 10 years ago, though that drop may be partly a product of fewer people subscribing to pay-TV or streaming services. Stock car racing has been gradually reverting to its roots as a regional Southern sport, a far cry from its glory days two decades ago, when its popularity exploded nationally. Ratings for the Daytona 500 topped the World Series for four years in the mid-2000s.NASCAR's turnaround strategy targets fans in big cities with unorthodox events: A race earlier this year on a miniature track inside the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum helped generate a 24% boost in season-long NASCAR viewership in that market, according to Nielsen. Giese notes that 70% of attendees had never been to a NASCAR event before. Another promising sign: Despite many U.S. households dropping pay-TV subscriptions in recent years, TV viewership for NASCAR's regular season rose 4% this year, reversing a decade of steady ratings losses.Now it's wagering Chicago can turbocharge its push to reach new fans. If the plan works, it could establish the city as an unlikely NASCAR hub for years to come and set off a new era of American stock car racing.\"The city of Chicago is really an incubator of sorts to launch what the next version of the sport might look like,\" says Toure Claiborne, an executive at Chicago-based media and marketing firm Intersport who negotiates sponsorship deals with NASCAR for corporate clients.NASCAR has tried using Chicago as a springboard before. The circuit moved its annual race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet from midsummer to the September opening event of what amounts to its playoffs from 2011 to 2019, hoping to capture more attention in the nation's third-largest market.But luring fans to events 40 miles from downtown proved difficult. A mix of factors, including top drivers retiring, a lack of entertainment amenities near Chicagoland Speedway, bad weather and waning interest in the sport nationwide kept NASCAR from getting its intended payoff from Chicago. The circuit ultimately pulled its race out of the area entirely in 2020.Roughly 1.2 million people in the Chicago area\u0097about 13% of the metro population\u0097have at least some interest in NASCAR today, Nielsen Scarborough data shows. That's down from 18% a decade ago and 26% five years before that. In Charlotte, N.C., a traditional NASCAR market, the current share is about 28%.NASCAR hopes for better luck in Chicago with a higher-profile event featuring a 2.2-mile course touching Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue, with the city skyline as a striking TV backdrop. Helping its cause is an enthusiastic partner in Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who's eager to showcase Chicago on national TV at a time when its crime-sullied downtown desperately needs positive media attention.\"With NASCAR's global appeal and media coverage, this event is an excellent way to showcase so many of the wonderful things about Chicago that make it a world-class city,\" a Lightfoot spokeswoman says in a statement. The statement does not address pushback against the event from downtown aldermen who complained they weren't consulted about the race before a deal was struck and criticized the terms as too generous to NASCAR. But the spokeswoman points to Lightfoot's public comments from early August on those issues noting that all aldermen \"were briefed ahead of time\" and that the better NASCAR does with its event, the higher the financial return will be for public coffers.NEW EMPHASISThe urban setting reflects NASCAR's new emphasis on creating spectacles that will draw larger TV and streaming audiences, rather than solely focusing on filling massive grandstands at rural tracks. Broadcast rights fees, after all, were cited as the reason revenue rose by 1% in 2018 to $675 million for International Speedway Corp.\u0097the publicly traded track owner that NASCAR acquired the following year\u0097while revenue from ticket sales in 2018 fell by 10%.The high costs of building out the street race downtown will likely turn the event into a loss leader for NASCAR, but one that will expose it to new viewers at a crucial time: The circuit is about to enter negotiations for a new media rights agreement as its current 10-year, $8.2 billion deal with Fox Sports and NBC approaches a 2024 expiration. Despite a drop in TV ratings since it negotiated the last TV deal, NASCAR reportedly seeks nearly 15% more.\"That's the power play\" of the Chicago race, says John Rowady, president of Chicago-based sports marketing agency Revolution. Given the eye-popping sums that leagues like the NFL, NBA and Big Ten Conference have commanded for media rights, made-for-TV events like NASCAR's L.A. and Chicago races \"start to secure the value piece that they need in an upcoming TV deal,\" Rowady says.Giese, a veteran NASCAR marketing executive tapped to run the Chicago event after five years leading Arizona's Phoenix Raceway, notes that Chicago is one of NASCAR's largest markets by total number of fans and stresses that the street race's success will be measured by more than profitability.\"The financial side of this and the dollars are not the driver at the event,\" she says. \"It's that we're reaching new audiences and bringing our sport to more people that haven't been exposed to it before.\"So how does NASCAR plan to do better in Chicago than Joliet? The most obvious advantage is that the Chicago race will be easier for local fans to get to. But Giese admits that lakefront racing itself may not be the primary draw for Chicagoans next July. So NASCAR is marketing the two-day event as an entertainment festival with a pair of what she dubs \"A-list concerts\" after races on both days and food offerings from Chicago restaurants. NASCAR priced two-day general admission tickets starting at $269 and hired Four Leaf Productions to help stage it, a company led by longtime Lollapalooza event producer Charlie Jones.Giese, who grew up on a Colby, Wis., dairy farm and aspired to become a geneticist before taking a sharp turn into motorsports, also sees science as a tool to attract new fans. NASCAR aims to partner with Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Park District to highlight the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) side of stock car racing to kids in communities where NASCAR may not resonate, though it has yet to finalize any detailed plans.\"It's different from Joliet,\" she says. \"We're investing in and becoming members of the community in Chicago.\"",

  "Title": "Pandemic pushed Chicago to redouble its efforts",
  "Text": "At the policy level, Chicago has tried to tackle homelessness with a sense of urgency since 2001, when the city devised its \"Getting Housed, Staying Housed\" plan.Eleven years later, when that plan was set to end, former Mayor Rahm Emanuel proposed \"Chicago's Plan 2.0: A Home for Everyone,\" a seven-year plan with seven priorities designed to improve access to housing and services, end youth homelessness and help more people secure employment.Advocates with the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, or CCH, say Emanuel's plan was needed because the city didn't commit the necessary resources to the first plan.The 2.0 plan's last progress report, released in April 2017 in a chart-filled document, showed a 13% decrease in homelessness over the previous two years. But it is difficult to get a handle on just how many people in Chicago are homeless because so many factors are at play, advocates say.Contrary to what city reports proclaim, the count didn't actually go down because it doesn't reflect different populations, says Julie Dworkin, director of policy at CCH, which has pushed for permanent solutions to homelessness since 1980. Public school students make up one of those populations.\"The Chicago Public Schools numbers went up for many years. (Numbers) took a big dip during the pandemic when students were working remotely, but now they're up at pre-pandemic levels,\" Dworkin says. \"So there hasn't really been a decline in terms of students experiencing homelessness.\"A July 2021 study by University of Chicago Inclusive Economy Lab looked at student homelessness. \"In Chicago alone, nearly 18,000 students lack a stable place to call home,\" the authors wrote, and of those students experiencing homelessness, 85% identify as Black.ASSESSMENTSAnother measure of homelessness, the Point-in-Time, or PIT, count, annually assesses sheltered and unsheltered people experiencing homelessness at one moment in time. Although the U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development requires a count every two years to determine federal funding, the Chicago Department of Family &amp; Support Services in 2013 implemented yearly counts for the city.Housing advocates have called that count inaccurate, too.\"HUD has a much narrower view of homelessness, and the PIT count dramatically undercounts homelessness while pointing to the wrong policy solutions,\" Dworkin says. In 2019, the PIT count showed 5,290 people in Chicago experiencing homelessness, while the coalition estimated the homeless population to be 58,273.Brandie Knazze, DFSS commissioner, admits that PIT doesn't show the actual number of homeless people. \"That's one point in time. That's one metric,\" she says. \"That's why there's that difference, but we have to follow the guidelines of our funder (HUD) in order to provide services for the city.\"In 2021, about a year into the pandemic, PIT tabulated 4,477 Chicago residents experiencing homelessness. The city attributed the decrease since 2019 to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's eviction moratorium during the early part of the pandemic and economic stimulus payments that increased housing and homeless prevention resources.The city has yet to release 2022 PIT data.The pandemic did push many Chicagoans into homelessness, but just how many is still unknown, Dworkin says.To speed up getting more people permanently housed, advocates have sought an ordinance that would require the Chicago Housing Authority to fill more of its vacant units. Some of those units could be filled by those experiencing homelessness. But the waitlist is long.Harry Williams is one of those people. He has been on a CHA waitlist since November.Getting housed is one of the most difficult challenges he has faced. \"They didn't tell me that the waiting list was like a 10-year waiting list,\" he says.FUNDINGAs the pandemic dragged on, Chicago began putting more funding toward homelessness.In September 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and DFSS announced that more than $35 million in CARES Act funding and $1.3 million from Chicago Funders Together to End Homelessness would go to the Expedited Housing Initiative, a homeless intervention program aimed at connecting residents experiencing homelessness to available rental subsidies and units by removing barriers, such as income verification, and other limitations that can impede expeditious placement. In total, Chicago allocated $117 million for homeless support services in the city's 2021 recovery plan.To further aid those affected by COVID-19, Lightfoot backed the Chicago Resilient Communities Pilot. Under the cash assistance program, 5,000 low-income Chicagoans will receive $500 in monthly installments for one year to use as they wish. Lightfoot supported the pilot program after seeing the impact that federal payments, received at the height of the pandemic, had on those living in poverty.The city's efforts are only temporary and should focus on more permanent solutions, says Molly Brown, associate professor of clinical community psychology at DePaul University and director for the Homelessness Advocacy, Research &amp; Collaboration Lab.\"The city received millions of dollars for COVID relief, and they used that money predominantly to fund a rapid rehousing-type housing model, where people were being placed in apartments and given temporary rent subsidies,\" Brown says. \"But those subsidies are going to run out at some point, and then folks are going to have to be able to financially sustain themselves independently. And the problem with that is that the forces of poverty don't go away.\"",

  "Title": "Chicago's convention comeback trails rivals",
  "Text": "Chicago's convention industry is up and running again but falling behind other cities in the race to revive trade shows, corporate meetings and other business gatherings.A new report from meetings analytics firm Knowland says that 21 of the 25 largest U.S. convention and trade show markets are on track to return to 2019 levels of events and attendance by 2024\u0097including several that will achieve the mark this or next year\u0097but that Chicago is in a small group of laggards that won't fully recover until at least 2025.Nearly a year after Illinois lifted a ban on in-person indoor gatherings, a mix of factors is delaying the comeback of a multibillion-dollar local industry that's one of the state's most important economic engines. They include the slow lifting of pandemic restrictions, a devastated hotel scene and fear of crime in the heart of the city, according to Knowland. These recent developments, combined with pre-crisis trends like shrinking events and the emergence of more competitor cities, have caused Chicago to lose ground to rival markets.While it may not be a permanent shift of business away from the city, it's one that is being felt sharply by hotels, restaurants and other local businesses that depend on the convention trade. Reversing the shift will take some heavy lifting by Mayor Lori Lightfoot, convention center officials and new Choose Chicago CEO Lynn Osmond.\"It comes back to the perception that other regions are more open for business and less restrictive on what can be done,\" says Jeff Bzdawka, a former Hyatt Hotels executive who took over as Knowland's CEO last year. \"Chicago needs a PR campaign to let planners know it's open for business.\"SLOW RETURNMcCormick Place is slated to host 183 events in 2022 that draw 1.5 million attendees, roughly 51% of the headcount it saw in 2019, according to the Metropolitan Pier &amp; Exposition Authority, which owns and operates Chicago's main convention center. There are fewer events on the books, and attendance at most events in recent months is about 65% of pre-pandemic levels, MPEA estimates. Lower attendance means events don't generate as much local spending bang as they used to.By comparison, convention centers in two of Chicago's top competitor markets for large events\u0097Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas\u0097have already surpassed some of their pre-COVID metrics. A spokeswoman for Orlando's Orange County Convention Center said the venue is on track to host 1.5 million event attendees during the 12 months ending Sept. 30, up from 1.4 million during the comparable 2019 period. The Las Vegas Convention Center is slated to host 87 trade shows and events this year, more than the 85 held there in 2019, according to the city's convention and visitors authority.Phoenix, Ariz., and Tampa, Fla., are projected to hit pre-pandemic performance levels this year, with six more major markets following suit in 2023, according to Knowland, which uses a database of thousands of events nationwide over the past 15 years as well as recent market data to create its forecast.Bzdawka says meeting planners' perception of Chicago as a destination has been harmed by harsher COVID restrictions and a loss of vibrancy downtown. Some events moved to other cities that were more open during the pandemic, raising questions about when or if they'll be back.The National Confectioners Association, which held its annual Sweets &amp; Snacks Expo in Chicago for more than two decades, moved the 16,000-person event to Indianapolis last year because the city was allowing large gatherings. The event returned to Chicago this year and will be held here again in 2023, as per its current contract. But the confectioners association recently announced the show would begin alternating between Indianapolis and Las Vegas from 2024 through 2032.Though it's harder to measure, Chicago's struggle with violent crime is another big obstacle, meeting planners say. Chicago ranked 18th for safety in a 2021 index of the 25 best large event destinations compiled by event planning research firm Northstar Meetings Group, dragging the city's overall rank down to No. 8.Tammi Krone, an associate regional vice president at event planning firm Helms Briscoe who helps corporations choose locations for major meetings, says she has not had any clients cite crime as a reason to leave or steer clear of Chicago. But frequent headlines about violence downtown add to questions about whether the city is as much of a draw as it was before the crisis and can hinder event organizers' primary goal of getting people to attend.\"It's the perception of what's going on there that's hard to overcome,\" Krone says.The recovery looked anything but slow at McCormick Place in recent weeks. Despite rising COVID cases in the city, tens of thousands of visitors swarmed the convention center campus late last month as the National Restaurant Association Show and Sweets &amp; Snacks Expo ran simultaneously. The restaurant show drew more than 51,000 attendees on its busiest day\u0097blowing by its projected peak of 40,000 and its 42,000 peak in 2019\u0097and international attendance for each event surpassed their 2019 levels.Although MPEA CEO Larita Clark says recent attendance figures exceeded the authority's expectations, the agency is still budgeting for a 2025 return to pre-pandemic performance levels. She contends Chicago's more conservative approach to COVID rules can be an advantage to make attendees feel more comfortable about showing up. She also stresses the importance of tourism agency Choose Chicago\u0097which books events on behalf of MPEA\u0097filling leadership vacancies and staying connected to leaders of events that have moved to other cities.SKYROCKETING COSTSAfter a protracted search process to find Osmond as its CEO, Choose Chicago is close to hiring a new executive to run its convention sales, a role that has been vacant since September. Osmond, who took the reins at Choose Chicago last month, was not available to comment.\"I'm looking forward to us getting out there and kind of reinventing Chicago and letting folks know what we really have to offer,\" Clark says.Event planners say group bookings have been picking up throughout 2022 and that some meeting organizers can't find space at hotels and other venues downtown because of events that were canceled by COVID and rolled over into this year.Yet there is also concern that companies will scale back meeting plans as airfare and shipping costs skyrocket, says Chris Gowe of event strategy consultant Tradeshow Logic. That would have industrywide impact, but would especially hurt markets like Chicago, where 20% of the hotel rooms booked each year are tied to conventions and trade shows.\"People will compare it to the experience of not having (events) and say, 'We spent X amount to go to that show\u0097did we get more leads? More sales? More networking?' Gowe says. \"If they didn't, they'll continue doing webinars or cut down on the number of events they attend.\"",

  "Title": "TV, film production in Chicago jumps to a record",
  "Text": "While much of Chicago's economy is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, the film industry has come roaring back and has hit a new record for spending here.According to figures released June 16 by the state and city, producers of movies, TV shows and streaming services spent an estimated $631 million in the state in 2021, with $373 million going toward wages alone. That not only surpasses the $362 million when much local production was shut down because of COVID, but is comfortably above the estimated $560 million spent in 2019.TV IN THE LEADAs usual, TV productions, in which Chicago has carved out a nice niche, are the big horse, with 1,331 of the 1,771 permits issued by the city last year for TV shows such as \"Chicago Fire,\" \"Chicago Med\" and \"Chicago P.D.,\" along with new productions including \"Shining Girls\" from Apple TV+ and \"61st Street\" from AMC Studios.Suburban and downstate areas are getting into the act, too, with HBO's series \"Somebody Somewhere\" filmed in Lockport and Legendary Television's \"Paper Girls\" and \"Night Sky\" (formerly known as \"Lightyears\") for Amazon Studios primarily shot outside Chicago proper.\"Every TV and film project here in Illinois brings a flurry of economic activity to our state,\" Sylvia I. Garcia, director of the Illinois Department of Commerce &amp; Economic Opportunity, which houses the Illinois Film Office, said in a statement. \"Every production creates a multiplier effect by increasing foot traffic to local stores and restaurants, recruiting local extras, and hiring our talented crews\u0097and then by making our incredible Illinois landmarks well known to audiences across the globe.\"\"Chicago's TV and film industry is globally renowned and continues to generate significant economic and cultural gains for our city,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot. \"Our forward-thinking Chicago Film Office is building the infrastructure with initiatives such as the 'Chicago Made' workforce program that will continue to open doors for our residents and deepen investments in our communities.\"To try to keep that business coming, the General Assembly this spring extended and expanded the state's film tax credit with a goal of bumping up total spending in the state to $1 billion. Local production has traditionally been focused at the Cinespace soundstage complex on the Southwest Side, but a variety of other groups have been talking about opening their own production facilities here.Driving the growth has been the fracturing of the TV market, with not just three or four big networks but cable channels and increasingly internet streamers needing product. That product has to be shot somewhere . . . so why not Chicago?",

  "Title": "Now comes the election Chicago really cares about",
  "Text": "Now that the warm-up act\u0097the 2022 general election\u0097is over, Chicago can turn to the electoral contest that's the only one it really cares about: the cattle call known as the race for mayor.This one is going to be particularly tricky to follow, folks, given that incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot may not even be the favorite, much less the prohibitive one. So here are a few things to watch as candidate petition filing opens Nov. 21.The biggest immediate question is who actually will make it to the ballot. Declaring your candidacy is easy. Actually getting the minimum of 12,500 signatures from registered Chicago voters who haven't signed another candidate's petition\u0097and getting them by the courtroom full of snapping lawyers champing to knock out a signature because it excluded a middle name, had a superfluous dot or two, or whatever\u0097is amazingly tough. Ask Barack Obama: He got his start by knocking out then-state Sen. Alice Palmer on a technicality.So, after moves by challenge-happy candidate Willie Wilson and others, let's say a dozen names are left. Then starts the first of two campaigns: not the campaign for the April runoff election, in which the winner will need 50% of the vote plus one for victory, but the campaign to make it through the initial February vote. Any candidate who can score 25% to 30% of the vote in the February round is a lock to make it to April, in my view. Twenty percent might make it, too. Which means that instead of appealing to a broad range of voters, some candidates may figure their best shot is to really rev up their part of town, racial group, ideological soul mates or whatever, and leave citywide concerns to April.That's why the short-term focus is going to be on candidates lining up support from their natural base. It's why the fight for the loyalty of progressive voters among U.S. Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, state Rep. Kam Buckner and others is so important. Ditto the debate in the African American community about which of its sons and daughters will get most of its vote: Wilson, Lightfoot, Buckner, Ald. Sophia King, Ald. Roderick Sawyer, activist Ja'Mal Green and probably others\u0097all fighting for what insiders say may be just 30% of the vote.Then there's the North Side lakefront and adjacent wards, which tend to have a disproportionate influence in mayorals. No lakefronter\u0097physically or philosophically\u0097has been in the race since Ald. Tom Tunney, former U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley backed off. Unless someone new appears at the last second, a good eight or nine wards will be up for grabs. There's reason to think Lightfoot's base there has dwindled. Garcia could do well there. But so could former schools chief Paul Vallas, who could be a powerful factor if he can add the North Side to his natural base on the Northwest and Southwest sides.Once we get to issues, the key questions, I suspect, will be crime and social equity, two matters that are intrinsically linked. Lightfoot is trying to hold the center, saying Chicago needs both a strong police presence and increased investment in job-creating ventures in long-shortchanged neighborhoods that breed crime. Vallas and probably Ald. Ray Lopez will come at her from the law-and-order right, with progressives from the violence-reduction left.Who holds the winning hand there? In New York's recent mayoral election, former cop and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams was elected on a strong law-and-order platform that might not be too different from Vallas'. But in the Los Angeles election this month, progressive U.S. Rep. Karen Bass triumphed over the more conservative (and big-spending) businessman Rick Caruso.Speaking of business, if Chicago's once-muscular business community is going to get involved, it needs to get busy, or it may get both a hostile mayor and City Council. More on that later.",

  "Title": "When is a newspaper not a newspaper?",
  "Text": "We live in a time when independent, nonpartisan journalism is increasingly rare\u0097and more necessary than at any other moment in living memory.With shouts of \"fake news\" echoing in their minds, people who care about the world around them and the fate of our fragile democracy find it harder than ever to find trustworthy sources of verified, unbiased and balanced information. In other words, journalism. Which is why it's disappointing to see the leaders of one such news organization\u0097the Daily Herald\u0097make a move that blurs the line between fact and fiction.The newspaper and its owners, Paddock Publications, are now taking steps to undo the reputational damage created when its commercial printing division struck a deal to print and help distribute faux newspapers created by conservative activist Dan Proft. As Crain's has reported, these printed products, masquerading as real journalism, have been turning up in mailboxes around Illinois lately.Mimicking the look and feel of actual newspapers, these publications, sporting names like \"Chicago City Wire\" and \"West Cook News,\" make inflammatory claims about the policies of Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and other public officials, complete with splashy headlines on flashpoint topics ranging from cash bail and crime to property taxes and COVID policy. In short, they are propaganda. And when these publications started hitting the street, there was reason to wonder where they came from and who was paying for them. Their pages contained next to no such disclosure.It eventually came to light that these imitation newspapers were being printed by Paddock Publications' commercial printing arm and distributed with a postage permit registered to Paddock.Predictably, a kerfuffle ensued, prompting the governor to pull out of a candidates' forum being hosted by Paddock's Daily Herald. Within hours of the governor's move, Paddock's owners issued a letter to readers announcing that it was severing its ties to Proft's Local Government Information Services. Paddock's letter eventually proved persuasive enough to change the governor's mind about attending the forum\u0097though the letter seemed more interested in scolding observers than explaining why the leadership of a legitimate journalistic organization would have agreed to print and circulate this sort of product in the first place.\"Many critics cannot or refuse to differentiate between a commercial printing operation . . . and the Daily Herald's editorial mission to be unbiased and fair,\" the letter states, without addressing the still-unanswered question of whether LGIS mailed these materials on Paddock's dime. \"The perception for some has become that the Daily Herald favors one party over another and by printing for LGIS, it's somehow promoting its message. That is not true.\"Actually, producing and apparently providing postage for this stuff is pretty much the definition of promoting this message. And, to be clear, the look would be just as bad if Paddock had printed and lent its postal permit to sham newspapers that amounted to unlabeled ads for Pritzker or Lightfoot.We're not talking about slick pamphlets, brochures or posters here\u0097the kind of material that voters are accustomed to finding in their mailboxes, stuck into their doorjambs or pressed into their hands as they run for the train during campaign season. We're talking about deceptively designed mailers that are clearly meant to simulate newspapers\u0097printed and evidently distributed by a company that, however inconveniently in this case, happens to be in the news business.That juxtaposition is a particularly unhelpful one for the entire profession as journalists try to do what they do against challenging headwinds. Real journalists ask tough questions, hold power to account, correct the record when they get things wrong, and report only what they know\u0097based on honest reporting and clear-eyed analysis\u0097to be true. Journalism is a public trust. And as \"The Journalist's Creed,\" a time-honored declaration first published by the Missouri School of Journalism more than a century ago, puts it: \"Acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is a betrayal of this trust.\"",

  "Title": "Ex-Bear closer to getting $10M subsidy for project",
  "Text": "Former Chicago Bears defensive end Israel Idonije is a key step closer to turning a historic Motor Row building into a mixed-use complex after a city panel signed off on a $10 million public subsidy for the project.The city's Community Development Commission Feb. 14 unanimously approved the tax-increment financing grant for Idonije's planned revamp of the landmark Hudson Motor Building at 2222 S. Michigan Ave. If the taxpayer grant and a corresponding redevelopment agreement are finalized by the City Council, it would help finance a nearly $63 million transformation of the 100-year-old building with 38 residential units, 18 hotel rooms and a series of other elements including a restaurant, event space, a speakeasy and a rooftop pool and bar.The TIF money could help Idonije move forward with one of the largest redevelopment projects on Motor Row, a historic Near South Side thoroughfare that began drawing more real estate investors several years ago as former Mayor Rahm Emanuel sought to turn the area near McCormick Place into a more dynamic entertainment district.FOOT TRAFFICSome of that momentum was stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic, but Idonije's project could help bring more foot traffic to the area even when the convention center campus is quiet. Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration also wrapped up an $11 million project last summer that included widening Motor Row's sidewalks and adding new landscaping, among other improvements.\"Being the biggest building on the (Motor Row) block, we think we can be a really important part of that acceleration of growth,\" said Idonije, who spent most of his 11-year NFL career with the Bears and bought the vintage auto showroom building in early 2018 for $10 million.Idonije's joint venture in the project with Tustin, Calif.-based real estate investor Kelemen Caamano Investments plans to finance the project with more than $9.8 million in equity, almost $38 million in debt and about $5.1 million in proceeds from the sale of historic tax credits, in addition to the money from the Michigan/Cermak TIF district, according to Department of Planning &amp; Development records.MORE: Israel Idonije was a Crain's '40 Under 40' honoree in 2010TIF districts accrue property tax revenue above a baseline number in a designated area for a period of 23 years, with proceeds designed to support projects in blighted areas that wouldn't be redeveloped without the TIF assistance. The mayoral-appointed members of the Community Development Commission review and recommend action on proposed uses of TIF money to assist private development projects, often a controversial use of taxpayer dollars.The panel justified the TIF contribution in part because the redevelopment would create 150 temporary construction jobs and another 150 permanent jobs, according to the Planning Department.Idonije said the TIF money was a crucial piece to completing its financial puzzle and aims to begin interior demolition at the three-story building \"as soon as possible,\" with the goal of completing construction by midsummer 2024. He called the project a \"watering hole for the South Loop\" and likened the project to the Fulton Market District's Hoxton Hotel, offering a mix of hotel rooms, workspace and other amenities, but with the addition of apartments.\"And then beyond us, our hope is to be champions for that block . . . all those empty retail spaces, as soon as we can fill all those up with restaurants or pubs and bars, that quickly becomes a hot spot of the South Loop.\"CO-WORKINGIdonije's project will also include his FBRK (pronounced \"fabric\") co-working brand, which he launched in 2019 with a nonprofit-focused location in the Loop. The Motor Row project was also originally dubbed FBRK when Idonije and fellow investor and former Bears teammate Julius Peppers proposed it in 2018, and included co-working space as well as a 109-room hotel. Peppers remains involved in the project as an investor, Idonije said.Idonije pivoted from that vision early in the COVID-19 pandemic and even hired a real estate brokerage to sell the building, but it never struck such a deal.The building at 2222 S. Michigan opened in 1922 as an auto dealership and the home of the Hudson Motor Co. The property, which has been vacant for more than two decades, is part of the Motor Row District, which was designated as a Chicago landmark in 2000 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.Idonije has other real estate investments in the area, including a boutique gym called RSTR. He also leads a custom comics producer company called Athlitacomics.",

  "Title": "Lender seizes Chicago Board of Trade Building, betting on a Loop resurgence",
  "Text": "New York investment giant Apollo Global Management has taken control of the Board of Trade Building in the Loop and hired a Chicago developer to try to inject new life into the distressed landmark tower.A joint venture of Chicago-based Glenstar and Los Angeles-based private-equity firm Oaktree Capital Management last month transferred the 44-story office building at 141 W. Jackson Blvd. to an Apollo-led venture that provided the senior loan tied to the property, according to Cook County property records. The move completed a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, sources familiar with the transaction said, meaning Glenstar and Oaktree handed the building to its lender rather than face a likely foreclosure lawsuit over defaulting on its $256 million mortgage.The tower becomes one of the highest-profile downtown office buildings surrendered by its owner since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which fueled the rise of remote work and a barrage of office space cutbacks that have driven downtown office vacancy to an all-time high. That movement has devastated office property values, leaving some buildings underwater, or worth less than the debt their owners have borrowed against them. The soft market and rising interest rates have made it difficult for owners to refinance loans, pushing many office properties into financial distress or foreclosure.WAVE OF DISTRESSThe CBOT Building adds to an especially large wave of that distress along LaSalle Street. Several older, outdated office buildings on and near the Loop thoroughfare have lost large tenants and struggled to compete for new ones at a time when companies are craving amenity-filled offices that will help compel employees to show up.But Apollo is betting on a resurgence of the central Loop\u0097perhaps with a boost from Google as it plans to overhaul and occupy the James R. Thompson Center\u0097and that the CBOT Building can compete for new tenants with a fresh round of capital improvements. The firm has hired Chicago developer R2 to oversee renovations at the building and explore non-office uses \"to create a dynamic, mixed-use environment,\" R2 Principal Max Meyers said in a statement.\"Ownership is committed to (making) a substantial investment in the building to attract and retain tenants,\" Meyers said in the statement. \"We have a full stack, integrated operating team that is going to be very aggressive to win deals. . . .We will embrace the architecture and history and complement it with modern amenities with a value proposition.\"R2 is best known for owning office buildings in the city and its work on and near Goose Island, where it recently redeveloped the former Morton Salt warehouse on Elston Avenue into a music venue known as the Salt Shed. The company is also partnering with a foreign investor to turn the upper floors of the office building at 79 W. Monroe St. into apartments, in line with a broader effort by Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration to incentivize LaSalle Street residential conversions to help revitalize the Loop.The 1.4 million-square-foot CBOT Building is 82% leased, according to real estate information company CoStar Group, slightly above average today for downtown office buildings. Financial derivatives exchange CME Group, which signed a 15-year, 148,000-square-foot lease in the building in 2012 when it sold it to a joint venture of Glenstar and USAA Real Estate, is the largest tenant.Walking away from the historic property wipes out any equity that Glenstar and Oaktree had in the building, though the owners pulled in years of operating cash flow and were likely able to cash out with a windfall just before the pandemic.Glenstar and USAA paid about $152 million in 2012 for the property and subsequently put $35 million into the building for technological and other upgrades. Glenstar then recapitalized the property in late 2014, swapping out USAA for Oaktree and taking out a $160.8 million mortgage on the historic building, property records show.REFINANCINGGlenstar and Oaktree refinanced the building again with a new $178 million loan in May 2017, when it was appraised at $275 million, according to a Bloomberg report tied to the mortgage. A portion of that mortgage was packaged with other loans and sold off to commercial mortgage-backed securities investors, making much of the building's financial information publicly available. The building generated $7.2 million in net operating income in 2018 off of about $30 million in top-line revenue, according to the Bloomberg report.Then in 2019, with the downtown office market thriving, Glenstar and Oaktree tried to sell the property for a price they hoped would approach $330 million as investors clamored for office buildings downtown. But they never reached a deal and ultimately refinanced the property with the $256 million loan in February 2020. Proceeds from that new loan were meant to help fund new leasing efforts, though it also allowed the owners to pocket some profits from the building's appreciating value.Apollo subsidiary Athene provided a $198 million senior loan to lead the debt package in 2020, property records show, and Meyers said in a statement the balance of that loan when it seized the property was roughly $168 million. The 2020 refinancing also included a $58 million mezzanine loan from Los Angeles-based CIM Group, which had a balance of roughly $49 million when the property was transferred last month, according to Meyers. A CIM spokeswoman did not provide a comment.Spokesmen for Glenstar and Oaktree declined to comment.Known for its open outcry trading pits and faceless aluminum statue of Ceres, the Roman goddess of agriculture, that stands atop its roof, the CBOT Building was built in 1930 and stood as Chicago's tallest tower until 1965, when it was supplanted by the Richard J. Daley Center. The art deco tower, which has made cameos in movies like \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" and \"The Dark Knight\" and served as the studio home for 1970s dance show \"Soul Train,\" was designated a Chicago landmark in 1977 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.",

  "Title": "There's more to do in 2022, Chicago",
  "Text": "As September draws to a close, corporate executives are turning their attention to budgets and financial forecasts for 2023.Amid all the focus on the future, 2022 can start to seem like yesterday's news. But there are still three months left in the year, plenty of time to accomplish big things. With that in mind, here are my thoughts on objectives some local business and government leaders should try to achieve before the calendar turns.Walgreens. It's long past time for the giant drugstore chain to stop selling cigarettes. Walgreens is trying to transform itself into a health care provider, with doctor's offices attached to its stores. Yet it continues to sell one of the world's most deadly products. The leading cause of preventable death, smoking kills about 480,000 Americans annually from cancer, heart disease, strokes and other conditions.Walgreens archrival CVS Health, which is also pursuing a broader health care strategy, stopped selling cigarettes years ago. Which company has more credibility as a health care provider? Not the one that still sells cigarettes. Walgreens CEO Roz Brewer hinted in March that an announcement on cigarettes was coming, which raised expectations that the company would finally kick the habit. Since then, nothing. There's plenty of time to snuff out cigarettes this year.United Airlines. Chicago's hometown airline will get a second chance to repair its relationship with the flying public during the holiday travel season. United and other mainline carriers bungled their last one, when they were unprepared for a summertime crush of passengers eager to travel again after COVID-19 kept them grounded for two years. Flight delays, cancellations and lost bags reminded flyers how miserable the flying experience had become before the pandemic.Another test of service and reliability is looming as the holidays approach. It's also an opportunity for carriers to set themselves apart. If United delivers a better experience than competitors, customers will remember. And that could give United a competitive advantage well beyond 2022.Employers. With COVID-19 receding, uncertainty swirls around that cherished pandemic-era perk: remote work. Some companies are summoning all workers back to the office five days per week, while others opt for various hybrid formats, and still others waver and waffle. The next few months present an opportunity for executives to figure out policies that work for their companies.In a highly competitive talent market, employers can't afford to get this wrong. The right policy starts with an understanding of why so many employees prefer to work from home. So seek their input and pay attention to it. Companies also should look at objective, company-specific metrics that show how remote work has affected productivity in their operations. Policies should be flexible enough to accommodate the circumstances of as many employees as possible. Policies also should treat employees as adults who work hard wherever they are. If not, you need to improve your hiring practices.City Hall. Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the City Council need to work with business leaders on a plan to revitalize the Loop and North Michigan Avenue.Both areas have been hit hard by COVID-19 and rising crime. And both are critical to the city's future prosperity.Michigan Avenue is Chicago's showplace, a glamorous boulevard lined with high-end shops and striking architecture. It attracts out-of-town dollars, creates jobs and generates an outsize share of city tax revenues. The Loop is the beating heart of commercial Chicago, home to financial exchanges and global corporate headquarters. It's also a major source of jobs and tax dollars.Yet these key economic drivers are struggling, with office vacancies up downtown and empty storefronts dotting Michigan Avenue. Fortunately, the Urban Land Institute has written up recommendations for reinventing both areas. Those proposals can serve as a starting point for purposeful planning. There's no time to waste. The longer Michigan Avenue and the Loop languish, the harder it will be to restore them.Chicago CEOs. There's a long tradition in Chicago of business leaders coming together to advance important civic objectives. Today, no objective is more important than reining in crime across Chicago. Carjackings, robberies, expressway shootings and a growing sense of lawlessness are spreading fear from Lakeview to Lawndale and Streeterville to South Shore.Corporate leaders\u0097most recently McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski\u0097have done important work by publicly calling attention to the problem and explaining how crime and the perception of crime make it harder to do business in Chicago. Now it's time to pitch in on solutions.",

  "Title": "The search is on to fill an affordable housing gap",
  "Text": "Hoping to spark a new wave of housing construction on empty lots, city officials and an architecture group have launched a competition to find new designs that can be built affordably and in large numbers.Bungalows, two-flats and three-flats \"defined their eras,\" said Eleanor Esser Gorski, CEO of the Chicago Architecture Center. This design competition is looking for \"a new century's version of that, looking at both affordability and sustainability.\"The architecture group and Chicago's Planning &amp; Development and Housing departments are partnering on Come Home. It's essentially a residential complement to Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Invest South/West program, whose mission is to revitalize disinvested commercial corridors in the city.\"New two- and three-flats and other walk-up buildings will create the rooftops that support nearby commercial corridors, especially where Invest South/West is underway,\" Maurice Cox, commissioner of planning and development for the city, said in emailed comments.GROWING COMMUNITIESSome of the projects that Come Home generates could be built on sites in Auburn Gresham, Englewood, Woodlawn and other Invest South/West target areas, the competition's website says.In 2019, a different contest sought to find the bungalow of the 21st century. A difference with this latest contest, Gorski said, is \"that we're looking at critical mass, building 10 or 20 all together instead of scattered throughout Woodlawn.\"In its first phase, the Come Home program is calling for qualified architects to register for the contest by Jan. 9. Later they'll submit designs, and after another phase of evaluating developers, the program will pair architects with developers, and sometime after that specific designs will result.Gorski said no target has been set yet for how much it should cost to build the designs, although that will be a key factor in getting them built. Those figures should be available in the first few months of 2023, she said.\"The goal is to reduce sales prices for working-class buyers by reducing the costs of construction through innovative home designs\" and other strategies, Cox said. Among the strategies are \"clustered development sites to enhance economies of scale, land write-downs, and other city incentives like City Lots for Working Families\" and application of the city's affordable housing requirements ordinance.The emphasis is on multiunit buildings, in part because ownership of a two- or three-flat is a long-established route to building household wealth in Chicago.Like the city's November announcement of an expedited way to sell off thousands of vacant lots it owns, this competition is part of an all-out effort to \"grow these communities inclusively,\" Cox said.The resulting designs should not only \"be more affordable for buyers,\" Cox said, \"but also for emerging local developers to build. The program will help strengthen the capacity of minority developers already working in the South and West Side communities they love.\"RESIDENT INPUTAn important component of the design competition, Gorski said, will be collecting ideas from the communities where homes would be built. \"What are they looking for and what do they think it would take to get people to come back to these neighborhoods,\" Gorski said.Reed Kroloff, dean of the College of Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology, is a member of the jury that will select architects. He said community voices will help \"tell us how do they want houses built to respond to the concerns that people have in their communities today.\"As an example, he speculated the architects might learn that residents in neighborhoods plagued by violence might \"want to bring back front porches, so you have more eyes on the street.\"Beyond building new homes on the Invest South/West sites, the contest should result in a sort of \"pattern book,\" both Kroloff and Cox said. It would contain a set of designs from which someone who wants to build new housing on a city lot could select the ones best suited to their needs. Ideally it would include costs and materials lists.",

  "Title": "Chicago gets caught in some strong crosscurrents",
  "Text": "It was a week of mixed fiscal and economic developments for Chicago and Illinois, highlighting our enduring strengths while underscoring the persistent negatives that hold back our city and state.Starting with the good news, Chicago's tourism industry began bouncing back from the beating it took when COVID-19 squashed leisure and business travel for the better part of two years.As my colleague Greg Hinz reported, hospitality-related businesses had a good summer as visitors returned to downtown hotels. Guest counts reached 3.1 million room nights between June and August, 89% of the record bookings during the same period of 2019 before the pandemic. That's according to Choose Chicago, the city's tourism and conventions agency.A rebounding hospitality sector is good news for area workers. The industry generates tens of thousands of jobs in hotels, restaurants, bars, theaters, sports and other businesses that cater to visitors. Choose Chicago says hospitality employment this summer rose to 94% of pre-COVID levels.Even more encouraging is the broader takeaway: Chicago still appeals to travelers, despite our well-publicized and undeniable problems. Don't take my word for it, ask the readers of high-end travel bible Conde Nast Traveler, who last week voted Chicago the top U.S. big city for the sixth year in a row. And why shouldn't they? Chicago has unparalleled dining, architecture, theater, museums and a host of other attractions, all set against a magnificent lakefront that few cityscapes in the world can match.PENSION GAINSAnother positive came in public finance, for decades a reliable source of bad news. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle released 2023 budget proposals that address a primary cause of fiscal woes for the city and county: public employee pension funding shortfalls. The shortfalls stem largely from prior failures to contribute to pensions the amount of money that actuaries say is needed to cover the obligations.But that's starting to change. Under Lightfoot's budget, city pensions would get actuarially required contributions for the first time, along with an additional $200 million that she says would save taxpayers $2 billion in long-term costs.Over at Cook County, Preckwinkle reports that county pension funds now have 70.7% of the money they need to make future pension payments. That's up from 56.7% in 2016, when Preckwinkle pushed through a 1% sales tax dedicated to funding pensions.Both governments have a long way to go on pensions, and there's plenty to criticize elsewhere in the 2023 budget proposals. Lightfoot and Preckwinkle haven't turned into paragons of fiscal rectitude. But give credit where it's due; both have taken meaningful steps to contain the greatest threat to city and county finances. If they keep at it, taxpayers will be the winners.ANOTHER LOSSNow the bad news. In what's starting to seem like \"Groundhog Day,\" another big company is pulling corporate jobs out of Chicago. Tyson Foods announced plans to consolidate all corporate activities in its Springdale, Ark., headquarters, costing Chicago 500 well-paid jobs.Tyson's announcement follows a series of body blows to Chicago's standing as a headquarters town. Over two months this spring and summer, Boeing, Caterpillar and Citadel all announced plans to move their headquarters from Chicago.Even though the Tyson decision likely has more to do with the poultry giant's cost-cutting agenda than Chicago's attributes as a corporate base, it reinforces a damaging narrative. Every corporate defection is now seen as confirmation that issues such as crime, taxes and a perceived hostility to business make Chicago a lousy place for a headquarters. Even Chicago's recent wins, like the headquarters of Kellogg's snacks business and Google's planned move to LaSalle Street, haven't changed perceptions.That same narrative likely played a role in the week's other noteworthy disappointments. Illinois was bypassed twice for high-tech manufacturing plants likely to create thousands of white- and blue-collar jobs. Micron chose upstate New York for a new $100 billion semiconductor factory that would employ 9,000. Then came word that Michigan will get an electric vehicle battery plant with more than 2,000 jobs.These are the kinds of facilities and jobs Illinois needs to thrive in the 21st-century economy. Yet the state has lost out repeatedly as EV battery makers and others go elsewhere.The week's contradictory developments reflect the uncertainties of a city and state with great strengths and glaring flaws. Our challenge is to fix the flaws before they negate the strengths.",

  "Title": "Massive O'Hare project clears last hurdle",
  "Text": "The big terminal modernization and expansion plan at O'Hare International Airport has been officially cleared for takeoff.In an announcement on Nov. 21, the Federal Aviation Administration said it has signed off on the multibillion-dollar work, concluding it is in the public interest and will not cause significant air traffic problems.The project, which will add dozens of gates and hundreds of thousands of square feet of passenger and retail space, will be one of the largest public works programs in the city's history. It will come in later and cost more than originally expected, but officials said the scope remains the same.Under the latest plan, two new remote satellite terminals will be the first to open, in 2027 and 2028, off the existing Terminal 1, where most United Airlines flights are located.Once that is done, full-scale work will begin on the centerpiece of the project: the demolition and reconstruction of Terminal 2, which will be converted into a combined domestic and international terminal. That will locate customs and related facilities at the center of the airport, and not at the somewhat remote Terminal 5, as is the case now.Officials had estimated the project's cost at $8.5 billion\u0097but that's in 2018 dollars, when the plan was unveiled and approved by the City Council under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.The total cost of the project is now $12.1 billion, Chicago's Aviation Commissioner Jamie Rhee said on Nov. 21. The increase is due to a combo of inflation and extra projects that airlines have agreed to, she said.MILESTONEThe project will be funded by federal grants and taxes on airlines and passengers, not by general city revenue like property taxes.\"This is about remaining competitive on a global stage,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who along with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made the official announcement at O'Hare on Nov. 21. \"Everything we do will have a major effect both in Chicago and throughout the country.\"Lightfoot noted that the soon-to-be-demolished Terminal 2, where last week's news conference was held, was officially opened in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. The new terminal project will be a milestone as well, she said.Rhee declined to say exactly when construction work will begin, but declared the two satellite terminals will open in 2027 and 2028.Work on the new Terminal 2 will begin in phases in 2026 and be completed along with all other projects by 2030.ENVIRONMENTAL APPROVALButtigieg couldn't say for sure if Chicago will win a competition for major federal funding for the project, but he did say, \"I certainly wouldn't be surprised if a lot of strong applications from Chicago came in.\"In its statement, the FAA said it \"concluded that proposed construction projects and changes to air traffic procedures will not significantly affect any environmental resources, including noise, air quality, water resources and historic sites.\"U.S. Rep Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, who serves on the House Infrastructure Committee, also attended the news conference. He's also is running for mayor. He stood several feet to Lightfoot's left, and did not speak.",

  "Title": "A dispiriting reality: Teens killing teens",
  "Text": "On any warm-weather Monday, a glance at the newspaper provides a sobering catalog of gun violence that killed or maimed young people over the weekend just past.There's the 17-year-old boy shot and killed while standing near a sidewalk around 7:30 p.m. on a recent Friday evening in May on the 6900 block of South Ada Street. There's the two teenage boys\u0097one 16, one 13\u0097hospitalized after being shot while walking down the 7700 block of South Essex Avenue at about 4 p.m. on a recent Sunday afternoon. And there's the 16-year-old girl who died days after being shot in the head on the 4300 block of West Adams Street around 7 p.m. on a recent Friday.The Monday morning police blotter of course doesn't account for the number of shootings that take place on every other day of the week, in nearly every other neighborhood of the city, involving victims of all ages.And it of course also doesn't account for several of the more headline-grabbing incidents that have taken place since the temperatures started to creep up, inspiring young people to take to the streets presumably to enjoy the first glimmers of summer. There was the shooting by The Bean in Millennium Park, of course\u0097the one that claimed the life of a 16-year-old boy on a Saturday evening in May. And then there was the Thursday night shooting near a notorious trouble spot at Chicago Avenue and State Street, an altercation in which two young people were killed and seven were wounded.But the Monday shooting roundups underscore a few especially troubling aspects of what's shaping up to be another summer of seemingly random mayhem in Chicago: Weekends are a particularly dangerous time. And, when the bullets fly, the victims are often very young\u0097and, often, so are the shooters.Kids shooting kids.As The Wall Street Journal pointed out recently in an editorial that furthered Chicago's national image for violence, more than 100 children have been shot so far this year in the city. We should note, of course, that the citywide murder rate overall is down 9% so far compared to this time last year, according to Chicago Police Department statistics. But that won't be much comfort to loved ones of the 224 people shot and killed in Chicago this year as of this writing, nor to the 942 shot and wounded so far.The really dispiriting thing, though, is the age of the people involved in many of these incidents. So many teenagers. The newspaper tallies offer only a surface glimpse of the problem. Just beneath that surface is a story of diminished hopes, thwarted ambitions, limited opportunities, failed education, few constructive social outlets and a sense of utter futility.How can this community undo that deeper damage? That's the ultimate challenge of our time.We can't have swarms of teenagers roving hundreds-strong and causing havoc for themselves and others; we can't have young people settling street-corner disputes at the point of a gun; we can't have residents feel unsafe sitting on their front stoop or strolling to the store, not only for all the economic and optical reasons we often cite\u0097it's bad for business, it damages Chicago's reputation and so on\u0097but because absolutely no one wants to live this way.So far, the Lightfoot administration has not articulated a coherent plan to curb the violence that's percolating in the run-up to this Memorial Day weekend. The citywide curfew enacted after the recent Millennium Park incidents have the feel of a Band-Aid applied to a gaping wound, serving mainly to criminalize youth and to give a sense that the administration is doing something\u0097anything. But does anyone honestly think this measure will put a significant dent in the problem? Do the mayor and her police chief have any other strategy in mind to anticipate where violence is likely to flare up and, perhaps more important, to get more police officers onto the streets where they're needed most?Sadly, the answers to these questions will likely come in the next batch of Monday morning crime reports over what is historically a bloody weekend, Memorial Day.",

  "Title": "City adds twist to Invest South/West approach",
  "Text": "City planning officials are hunting for developers and architects to transform a pair of high-profile corridors on the South and West sides, tweaking an approach it has taken with Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Invest South/West initiative.The Department of Planning &amp; Development recently issued two requests for qualifications to redevelop a collection of properties: one group of city-owned sites around the CTA Green Line Kedzie Station in East Garfield Park and another series of parcels along 63rd Street in Woodlawn.It's similar to the Invest South/West strategy employed over the past two years, in which planning officials laid out their vision for redeveloping blighted commercial corridors in 10 South and West Side neighborhoods, offered up a menu of public incentives available to make them happen, then solicited bids from developers to bring them to life.The new RFQs take a different tack. Each focuses on a more ambitious, larger assemblage of properties than the individual sites targeted under Invest South/West. And instead of asking developers to work with designers to fine-tune ideas before pitching them, planning officials are instead shortlisting two groups: Developers that can provide examples showing they could pull off such projects, and architects with a track record proving they could design them. Once those pools are finalized, members of each can choose who they want to work with to present project ideas to the city and community that could be selected to move forward.The framework is meant to lower the barriers to entry for real estate developers and investors in South and West Side neighborhoods, a focal point of the planning department under the Lightfoot administration. City officials have sought ways to induce new affordable housing and commercial projects in areas of the city that few developers will touch because of their history with disinvestment, poverty and population loss.Planning Commissioner Maurice Cox said the revised tactic was born out of feedback from developers that bid on Invest South/West projects over the past couple of years and lamented the time and money they had to put into proposals that weren't selected to move forward.RESOURCESUnder the new approach, developers \"know they're in the running and they can allocate the resources they need to win the commission,\" Cox said. \"This allows the development team to know who they're competing against and show up with their A game,\" Cox said.The RFQ process also brings neighborhood residents into the discussion earlier. Once developers and design firms from the shortlisted pools team up, the planning department will host workshop sessions for them to gather more input from the community before spending their resources on pre-development work like architectural renderings and engineering studies.Planning officials ran into pushback with Invest South/West projects from some residents who had a different vision for what was needed on a block. In Auburn Gresham, the winning bidders to redevelop a property along 79th Street with affordable housing ran into resistance from vocal residents who wanted to see more commercial development on the site.The East Garfield Park and Woodlawn sites are far different from the Invest South/West properties, which were mostly single, vacant parcels on blocks that were already established as neighborhood commercial corridors. The two new sites are close to areas of substantial investment but are wholly unproven as commercial corridors themselves. Cox envisions them becoming what he dubs \"15-minute neighborhoods,\" or mixed-use developments that provide retail, dining and neighborhood amenities within a 15-minute walk of residents' homes.\"This is a demonstration that we can create a neighborhood main street that we know makes living in a neighborhood worthwhile,\" Cox said.DEVELOPMENT PATHThe Kedzie CTA station is next to the Hatchery, a food and beverage business incubator, and 2 miles west of the United Center and in the path of development that has surged west from the Fulton Market District and the West Loop.The bids will target three sites along Kedzie, one of which is north of the station and two of which are south.In Woodlawn, the RFQ includes a series of properties on either side of 63rd Street that are less than a mile from the future Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. The RFQ envisions as many as six buildings being developed on the vacant sites.Both sites are in existing tax-increment financing districts that are going through a process to be renewed for another 12 years after their impending expiration dates. TIF money and low-income housing tax credits are among the incentives the city is promoting as available options to help developers finance projects.Responses to the RFQs are due by Sept. 14, according to a planning department spokesman. Cox said he aims to announce by the end of the year the development-design teams selected to move forward with projects on the sites.The planning department is hosting pre-development information sessions on Aug. 15 for the Woodlawn RFQ and Aug. 16 for the East Garfield Park RFQ.",

  "Title": "A smart move on economic development",
  "Text": "From an economic development perspective, the new year is off to a decent start after a relatively rocky 2022. A few bits of good local job-related news popped up in the headlines in the first week of January: For one, incoming Exelon CEO Calvin Butler announced he's moving back to Chicago, signaling that this $43 billion energy company and its thousands of employees will remain headquartered here. Meanwhile, the Fulton Market boom showed signs of rolling on as Related Midwest unveiled plans for a massive office tower there. And Chicago can, in a way, count a new corporate colossus among its ranks as GE Healthcare debuted as a standalone publicly traded company.But even more encouraging news to those who care about the Chicago region's future as a global business center was the Jan. 4 announcement that the city of Chicago and surrounding counties are going to work together\u0097and not against one another\u0097in the worldwide hunt for corporate headquarters and investment.For years, Crain's and others in the business community have called on our elected leaders to take a more unified, coordinated approach to regional economic development for the simple reason that the entire metro area\u0097stretching from northwest Indiana and even northward to Milwaukee\u0097is in this together, whether pols want to acknowledge it or not. Chicagoland\u0097a term we have traditionally steered away from using since it was popularized by Robert McCormick, the longtime publisher of our crosstown rival, the Chicago Tribune\u0097is just that, Chicagoland, despite the governmental borders that slice it up into so many balkanized fiefdoms. One burg's corporate win has ripple effects on other burgs, for better and sometimes for worse. But Chicago can't be attractive to outside investment if only one segment of the region thrives while others deteriorate.And yet, for too long, that's how the game has been played around here. And while it's only a starter project, seeded with just $3 million over an initial, three-year pilot period, there's reason to be hopeful that the Greater Chicagoland Economic Partnership announced by Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and DuPage County Board Chair Deb Conroy, could change the local mindset about what it takes to compete for jobs in today's economy.As Crain's Greg Hinz reports, the stated goal in the first three years is rather modest: generate 150 pro-Chicago-area decisions and 500 new shared investment opportunities; develop a common regional pitchbook; and expand the city's development unit, World Business Chicago, into the suburbs.That may not sound like much, but it would represent a major change from the recent past, in which the city and the suburbs openly feuded over such initiatives as the proposed Illiana Expressway, or when former Mayor Rahm Emanuel gloried in raiding the headquarters of large, suburban-based companies.Among members of the new partnership, in addition to Cook and DuPage, are Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties, along with their respective county development groups.They'll have plenty of good stuff to tout, including a well-educated workforce with historic roots in consumer products, the food industry, manufacturing, advertising and marketing, risk management, law, professional services and media, to name a few. World-class universities and medical centers, global air connections, relatively affordable cost of living, a vast public transportation network, as well as top-flight cultural and entertainment amenities will no doubt also be features of this new regional pitch.But, as must be noted far too often, there are challenges this newly formed coalition must somehow counteract: our region's tattered reputation on public safety, our notoriety as a cesspool of political corruption, our fiscal shortcomings, as well as a central business district still slow to recover from the ravages of the pandemic. For instance, JPMorgan Chase's decision to cut its Loop branch presence nearly in half, reported Jan. 5 by Crain's Steve Daniels, is a signal this banking giant isn't bullish on the future of downtown Chicago\u0097at least not for the foreseeable future. This news further clouded the skies over the Loop as landlords, retailers, restaurateurs, and office managers ponder the many ways in which remote work and e-commerce are transforming the very definition and purpose of a major metropolitan downtown.So there's a lot of uncertainty hanging over this fledgling regional economic development effort. Even so, one thing is fairly clear: None of the ills burdening this region will be resolved without cooperation. As Crain's columnist Joe Cahill points out, a corporate move from one part of metropolitan Chicago isn't a win for the region as a whole. More important: Fragmented and internally competitive economic development efforts among numerous municipalities don't fully capitalize on the combined strengths of greater Chicago.Here's hoping the economic development execs pledging to do things differently can achieve some near-term successes\u0097and maybe even learn some long-term lessons about how to build a better business environment for the entire region.",

  "Title": "City looks to spark Loop housing wave with TIF money, incentives",
  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration is hoping to get developers to turn outmoded LaSalle Street properties into residential buildings\u0097complete with lots of affordable housing\u0097by dangling a menu of public subsidies to try to jump-start new projects.In a move meant to help revive and bring new foot traffic to the city's pandemic-battered core, Lightfoot this week is expected to announce a new initiative offering tax-increment financing money and other public incentive programs to developers that convert properties in the heart of the Loop into housing, so long as at least 30% of the units created are affordable, according to sources familiar with the plan.With a goal of creating at least 1,000 new Loop residential units\u0097including 300 that are affordable\u0097over the next five years, the city will be soliciting proposals from developers and will support the effort with funds from the LaSalle Central TIF District, a controversial pot of money that has effectively been off-limits to new developments downtown since former Mayor Rahm Emanuel froze its use for private projects in 2015.Vacancy-ridden office properties along LaSalle Street are said to be the focal point of the effort, though several details remain unclear such as the number, types and sizes of properties will be eligible, as well as how much TIF money could be dedicated to them. A Lightfoot spokeswoman declined to comment.The initiative stands to be Lightfoot's most impactful move since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to revitalize LaSalle Street and its Loop environs. The corridor struggled with big departing office tenants before the public health crisis and has since grappled with a loss of vibrancy on its blocks that has devastated nearby retailers, some of whom have shuttered their stores. Some office landlords along the historic thoroughfare have surrendered properties to their lenders, while others are staring down dire debt troubles while soft demand for office space weakens their bottom lines.Lightfoot is hoping public subsidies will help breathe new life into the corridor and add to the recent momentum generated by Google, which announced in July that it intends to renovate, buy and bring thousands of jobs to the James R. Thompson Center, LaSalle Street's severely outdated northern anchor.Using TIF money to spur downtown development could stir controversy for a mayor who has prioritized development in disinvested neighborhoods over the urban core. TIF districts, which accrue property tax revenue above a baseline number in a designated area for a period of 23 years, are meant to target projects in blighted areas that wouldn't be redeveloped without TIF assistance. Earmarking such funds for downtown development could be a lightning rod for criticism.But Lightfoot is acknowledging the need for the city to play a financial role in bringing life back to the Loop. And the move to offer taxpayer funds is in line with a recent city-commissioned Urban Land Institute panel recommendation on how to restore LaSalle Street's vitality.The LaSalle Central TIF District, which was created in 2006 to help revive severely outmoded Loop buildings, has been used to fund public infrastructure improvements since 2015. The district's fund balance as of the end of last year was nearly $197 million, according to its most recent annual report.CLOUDY FUTUREOne big question facing Lightfoot's new program is whether it will entice real estate investors to bet on the future of LaSalle Street and the Loop. Residential developers have grumbled about the city ordinance passed last year requiring at least 20% of units in new residential projects to offer rents well below market rates, arguing such units whittle away the financial benefits of such deals. The 30% affordable component would be even tougher to swallow, but help from the city through TIF could help offset construction and other costs.The city is also bringing public subsidies to the table to try to ensure that affordable units are incorporated into residential conversions at all. The zoning designation for LaSalle Street buildings like Bank of America's distressed former office tower at 135 S. LaSalle St. already allows for those buildings to be converted into apartments. That means a developer could do so without having to commit to providing affordable units like it normally would to get the city to sign off on a zoning change. In the only residential conversion to date on LaSalle, a Florida developer turned a 13-story office building at 29 S. LaSalle St. into a 216-unit apartment building called Millennium on LaSalle that opened last year with no affordable units.Apartment redevelopments look good to developers these days amid an apartment construction boom in the city and a cloudy future for other asset types like offices, hotels and retail space. Fueled by a strong job market and growing demand for rental units, average apartment rents downtown hit an all-time high earlier this year, according to research firm Integra Realty Resources.The ULI panel, which included local developers, architects and urban planners, was tapped by the city earlier this year for ways to draw new types of users to LaSalle and assess what role financial incentives might play in bringing that vision to life.The panel published a 36-page report in June encouraging the city to create the \"LaSalle Landmarks Innovation District\" with a framework plan to turn the office-heavy financial district into a more pedestrian-friendly mixed-use destination with residential units, office space that services entrepreneurs and small businesses and service-oriented tenants like grocery stores, medical offices, cafes and restaurants, as well as visitor attractions like art galleries.The report said financial incentives from the city would be crucial to getting private investors to buy into that vision, especially if any of the properties are to include affordable housing. The panel suggested Cook County's Class L tax designation, Federal Historic Preservation Tax Credits, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and Illinois' recently passed affordable housing property tax incentive should all be leveraged to help revive older buildings.",

  "Title": "Peoples Gas' pipe-palooza costs keep rising",
  "Text": "Peoples Gas appears all but certain to exceed its latest cost estimate and timeline for a massive overhaul of Chicago's underground natural gas pipes, a project that's already billions over budget and years behind schedule.Underway for more than a decade, the project has seen its ultimate projected cost mushroom to $8 billion from $2 billion initially and then $4.5 billion. Based on progress and costs to date, Peoples will shell out nearly $11 billion to complete the job, not $8 billion. Peoples will pass that cost along to customers in their bills, plus a profit.Additionally, the utility won't finish the work until about 2048 at its present pace, well beyond the 2040 goal Peoples still assures regulators it will meet. That's 10 years past the original 2030 completion target.Peoples has yet to hit its annual pipe replacement target for any year since its 2015 acquisition by Milwaukee-based WEC Energy Group.Questions about Peoples' project are growing more insistent as the utility faces a critical year in Springfield. Authorization for a monthly surcharge Peoples imposes on Chicagoans' gas bills to help finance the work expires at the end of next year. Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot oppose Peoples' request to extend the surcharge.If\u0097as appears likely\u0097the surcharge expires, the city and state will finally have to come to grips with the future of Chicago's natural gas infrastructure. Heating bills, thanks in no small part to the surcharge that now costs the average Chicago household about $180 a year, are unaffordable for about 1 in 5 residential customers. That only will get worse if the project is allowed to run its course, pushing the costs to customers far higher.Exacerbating the situation are high natural gas prices expected to raise average heating bills in Chicago by more than 40% this winter.At stake for Peoples and its Wisconsin-based parent is strong profit growth that has helped WEC Energy boost its dividend by 7% annually. Peoples has set earnings records in each of the last five years despite a lack of population growth in its service territory. Over the past five years, WEC's total shareholder return (share price gains plus dividends) is 51%, easily beating the S&amp;P 500 Utility Index of 37%.Lightfoot, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Citizens Utility Board are girding for the legislative battle ahead.\"Peoples Gas is rushing to do upgrades it should have done gradually over the last several decades, which is what other gas utilities did,\" the city, AG's office and CUB say in a joint statement. \"The company is playing costly 'catch-up' and it is unmanageable. The customer surcharge that Peoples Gas uses to pay for this program makes up over 37% of the average delivery charge on a bill. That surcharge is due to expire at the end of next year and it should not be renewed by the legislature.\"Peoples isn't budging.\"We don't know what will happen with (surcharge) legislation in 2023,\" spokesman David Schwartz says in an email. \"We are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure ongoing safety, system reliability and environmental sustainability. As for what mechanism is used to pay for the necessary work, we will partner with policymakers and all stakeholders to determine what exactly that looks like.\"WEC Executive Chairman Gale Klappa said in February that if the surcharge isn't extended Peoples will file annually for full-blown rate hikes to cover the ongoing costs of the project. But Schwartz says Peoples has \"no plan at this time to file a rate case with the (Illinois Commerce Commission).\"Schwartz adds that the project is \"on track for completion by the end of 2040\" and stands by the total cost estimate of $8 billion.Based on Peoples' spending over the last three full years, it's difficult to see how the program will cost just $8 billion, even leaving inflation aside. Under former owner Integrys Energy Group, Peoples spent $1.1 billion through 2015 on what was then called the accelerated main replacement program. WEC acquired Peoples in mid-2015 and recast the initiative as the System Modernization Program, spending $538 million in 2016 and 2017.From 2018 through 2021, Peoples spent $1.2 billion, according to progress reports submitted to the ICC. So, at the start of this year, the program had cost a total of $2.8 billion. To hit the $8 billion budget, Peoples will need to finish the remaining work at a cost of $5.2 billion. That seems unrealistic, to say the least.As of the end of last year, Peoples had 1,614 more miles of aging pipes to replace. From 2018 to 2021, Peoples retired an average of 59.7 miles per year. At that clip, it would take the utility another 27 years to finish the work, putting the end date at 2048.The utility's record under its previous Chicago-based parent\u0097whose management of the program was widely derided, including by WEC\u0097was significantly more efficient. Including Integrys' track record, beginning in 2011, Peoples has retired an average of 68 miles of old pipe annually.But even if WEC manages to match that pace over the rest of the program, it still won't complete the work for another 23.5 years. That puts the finishing date at around 2045.From 2018 until 2021, WEC-owned Peoples spent a total of $1.18 billion to retire 239 miles of pipe, or $4.9 million per mile. At that rate, it will cost the utility another $8 billion to complete the job. Added to the $2.8 billion spent so far, that brings the program's total tab to $10.8 billion.Peoples takes issue with using the pace of retiring outdated pipes as the right metric to track the project's progress. \"Miles retired is a lagging indicator,\" Schwartz says. \"Ninety-nine percent of a project can be complete, but if there's a holdup on the remaining 1 percent, then retirement of the old gas main must wait. . . .Project costs more closely follow the timing of when we install gas main, as opposed to retirements\u0097which very much lag the spend.\"Schwartz says a better metric is the per-mile cost of new pipe installed. By that measure, the four-year average cost of the project is nearly $3 million per mile of pipe installed, a figure Schwartz says \"is aligned with our cost estimate of $8 billion.\"There's no way of checking that contention, though, in the reports filed with the ICC. The miles of new pipe far exceed the miles of old pipe being replaced because the company is installing two sets of replacement pipes on a street, with one pipe serving customers on one side and the other those living across the street. The old lines are single pipes serving customers on both sides of a street. The progress reports don't include how much new pipe remains to be installed, but they do chart how much of the old pipe still needs replacing.Miles replaced \"is just a very common metric,\" says Abe Scarr, director of Illinois PIRG, a consumer advocacy group and critic of the program's scope and management. \"If one assumes this is about replacing risky pipe, then tracking how much risky pipe is taken out of the system is the point.\"Why has progress been so slow? And so costly?Critics point out that the program has expanded from its original purpose of accelerating replacement of aging cast iron and ductile pipes, which are prone to leaking and pose a safety risk. Later, it emerged that Peoples was upgrading its entire pipe system for medium-pressure delivery of gas rather than low-pressure, a much bigger job.Another issue is the city's push to decarbonize all buildings within its boundaries over the next two decades. That would entail switching buildings heated with carbon-emitting gas to electric heat, potentially rendering the elaborate gas piping system obsolete. If that happens, Peoples customers could be paying for the pipe overhaul long after they stop heating with gas.",

  "Text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot last week released the report of her Museum Campus Working Group, and it recommends the city consider putting a dome atop Soldier Field, but doesn't say how the $1 billion-or-more cost would be funded or whether the move would be enough to keep the Chicago Bears in town.Most of the report focuses on broad themes of better knitting together the Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, the former Meigs Field site and the aging football stadium in a more pedestrian-friendly and ecologically sensitive manner.Among other things, the group proposes closing the music pavilion at the north end of Northerly Island and relocating it, possibly to the lawn between Soldier Field and the Field Museum. It also urges construction of a new pedestrian bridge to make access easier to Northerly Island, where Meigs used to be.It also urges \"adaptive reuse\" of McCormick Place's Lakeside Center without specifying a particular use; improved Chicago Transit Authority bus service to the campus; and restoring a trolley or mini-bus for internal circulation, as well as increased use of an improved Cermak Road to get visitors to the campus.However, there is no proposal for rail access of the type that developer Bob Dunn has pitched for his proposed One Central development nearby, though the report says internal busways could be converted to a higher-capacity system later and that a pedestrian bridge should be built over Metra tracks.In one proposal that could ruffle some feathers, the report urges creating a centralized governance group for the campus. That could irk institutions that are used to running their own affairs.At Soldier Field, the report recommends major investments in improved seating, concourses and support facilities such as restrooms.And, it says, \"To better utilize Soldier Field year-round, the city should also explore the feasibility of enclosing the stadium.\"There is one wording change from a previously reported draft report, which suggested there is no way a dome would pay for itself and that it would have to be subsidized by taxpayers. Instead, says the report's final version: \"Although enclosing Soldier Field would incuPersonal data of nearly 146,000 exposed in Aon hackr significant investment, further analysis is required to fully understand the specific costs, the potential direct and indirect economic impacts, and the full range of potential funding sources available to determine options that are respectful to Chicago taxpayers.\"In a statement, Lightfoot gave no specifics on when and how these suggestions might be implemented but said the report \"has provided us with a useful framework to guide that work, as well as to enhance the campus overall.\"",

  "Title": "With City Hall up for grabs, the business community must start speaking up now",
  "Text": "This is, in many ways, an extraordinary moment in Chicago political history.For the first time in living memory, the Chicago City Council and, perhaps, the mayoralty itself are in a very real state of flux. On the council side, the change has been taking place in slow motion over the past year as a raft of aldermen retire or, in some cases, head for the exits in light of legal troubles, creating openings for newcomers. And very real battles are shaping up for control of a swath of aldermanic seats, making the eventual ideological composition of the full council after February's election more difficult than usual to predict.Meanwhile, the mayor's race has shaped up to be a scrum, as 11 candidates vie for Mayor Lori Lightfoot's job. As Crain's Greg Hinz and Justin Laurence explained just after the Nov. 28 deadline for candidate filings, what's remarkable is the fact that none of these mayoral contenders is considered a front-runner, and none seems likely to win the 50%-plus-one vote necessary in February to avoid an April runoff.In the midst of all this churn are signs that the overall makeup of the City Council and the mayoral team on the Fifth Floor could very well be drifting in a direction that favors progressive candidates\u0097and that drift is worrisome for a Chicago business community eager for viable answers to the problems that plague the local economy.Chicago needs elected leaders who understand that public safety, fair taxation, balanced budgets, clean and efficient public transit, intelligent neighborhood development, top-flight schools and a vibrant downtown are crucial to this city's future as the business capital of the Midwest. But with candidates backed by unions\u0097and with progressive activists mobilizing to increase their influence at City Hall and talking up ideas like a $25 minimum wage, higher taxes on high-end home sales and the so-called LaSalle Street tax on financial transactions\u0097the business community's priorities could very well take a back seat to other concerns.Business leaders who have stayed out of the mayoral race have been fairly quiet so far. But, as Hinz and Laurence report, there are signs the city's business leadership is recognizing the need to get more involved in shaping the race. Mike Ruemmler, a consultant who managed then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel's successful 2015 re-election campaign, is putting together a political committee along with consultant Ron Holmes that will make independent expenditures on behalf of some candidates for alderman. And financial exec Michael Sacks confirmed to Crain's that he will support the new group financially.It's high time the city's business leaders started taking a more active role in shaping the civic conversation as February's elections loom. With Chicago's global reputation on the line, there's too much at stake for Chicago's CEOs, entrepreneurs and civic leaders to stay on the sidelines in this election season.Candidates for every local office\u0097particularly for the mayor's seat\u0097must face tough questions about what they will do to make Chicago a better place to build businesses and, in turn, to build livelihoods. None of the priorities that progressive candidates hold dear are achievable without a healthy economy, a fiscally responsible government, and the jobs and wealth that come with each. If the current crop of candidates vying for office won't argue for these values, then the business community must.",
