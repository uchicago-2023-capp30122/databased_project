Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.

Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

That claim is false. According to the\u00a0FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics, about 29 percent of people arrested for violent crimes, property crimes, or drug-related crimes are Black.\u00a0Abbasi told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0that he did not remember writing the \u201c13/50\u201d group chat, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t remember what I tweeted two days ago,\u201d but admitted that he could not rule it out. He confirmed that he wrote all of the others.\u00a0On January 6, Abbasi\u00a0retweeted a photoshopped picture\u00a0another user posted of him wearing Ku Klux Klan regalia and sitting next to Kanye West. He said he retweets \u201cevery photoshop people make of me\u201d and that doing so is \u201can exercise in absurdity.\u201dIn another group chat message, Abbasi wrote, \u201cNow that I\u2019m in a relationship with a 36-year-old woman it gives me leeway to say that child porn sentences are way too long, like anything more than a year for downloading anything is evil.\u201d He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the message was meant as a joke poking fun at Libertarians.He reiterated several times during the interview that the message about a client who \u201ctook care of\u201d him with \u201cPolish girls\u201d who may have been \u201ctrafficked\u201d was entirely fictional and meant as a joke.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get an idea that sounds funny, and I\u2019ll post it,\u201d Abbasi said. He said that in the group chats he \u201cliked to play the villain, and make up insane things to stir shit up.\u201d He compared himself to Nick Adams, a conservative commentator who served as a surrogate for Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign and has repeated the false claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen.\u201d Abbasi added that he thinks Trump is \u201cthe funniest man alive.\u201dAsked about his politics, he said he was anti-war and believes everyone deserves health care. He said that police district councils have to determine \u201chow we\u2019re going to ameliorate the rise in crime, but it has to be done constitutionally and equitably.\u201dHe said he had \u201cno idea who 99 percent\u201d of his 24,000 Twitter followers are and that he believes they have a range of political views. The engagements he gets on social media fill a desire for celebrity that has helped him successfully lose weight, he added. His current \u201cbit\u201d on Twitter is posing as an \u201cAlpha male\u201d who is also a \u201ccloseted homosexual.\u201d\u00a0\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Abbasi\u2019s Twitter profile links to his legal practice, in which he files election paperwork and ballot petition challenges for political candidates. He said he will work for just about anyone, but that in police district council races he exclusively worked for the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). Earlier this week, WBEZ reported\u00a0that the FOP paid Abbasi $10,000.In December 2022, Abbasi filed petition challenges against progressive candidates who were running together as slates for police district councils. On January 13, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners ruled in favor of the progressives and kept them on the ballot.Abbasi said that the FOP \u201cneeded an election attorney. We came to an agreement.\u201d He added that he has worked for Democrats and Republicans in the past, and \u201cthe focus is doing the job for the client.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care about his clients\u2019 political ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily ideal, [but] for a lot of candidates I\u2019m not even sure of their platform.\u201d\u00a0A candidate for police district council in the 25th District, Abbasi said he was considering running, and that the FOP gave him a \u201cgreen light\u201d because they were not running any other candidates in that district. Had the FOP not consented to him running, he said he may not have.Abbasi also put his own contact information on election filings he submitted for six other candidates. He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the FOP referred them to him. Those candidates are:Abbasi also defended \u201cProco\u201d Joe Moreno, a former alderperson who is running for City Council in the First Ward, against a\u00a0petition challenge by two residents, and was the attorney for a petition challenge against one of Moreno\u2019s opponents, Sam Royko. The CEBC ultimately kept both candidates on the ballot.\u00a0Update 1/19/23:\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader,\u00a0Moreno said, \u201cI had no knowledge of this behavior. I do not condone this behavior and I do not stand behind any racist/ misogynistic comments of any sort. As a proud\u00a0Latino, this is something that is quite upsetting and I will no longer be utilizing his services.\u201dUntil this week, Abbasi was listed as the treasurer for mayoral candidate Kam Buckner\u2019s campaign committee. He is still\u00a0listed as treasurer\u00a0for eight other campaign committees. On January 15,\u00a0Buckner disavowed Abbasi in a tweet, saying that he had a \u201cpurely administrative title,\u201d that Buckner was \u201cincredibly disturbed\u201d by Abbasi\u2019s racist and misogynist posts, and that Abbasi was \u201cnever part of our regular working team and hasn\u2019t spent time in our campaign office.\u201d\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader, Buckner\u2019s campaign reiterated the disavowal. \u201cHe was the campaign\u2019s election lawyer during the petition process. He was never on the finance committee. As the campaign\u2019s lawyer, he was registered as campaign treasurer on the Illinois Board of Elections.\u201dAbbasi also said he hadn\u2019t worked directly for Buckner\u2019s campaign and that he forgot he was listed as its treasurer."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term.

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman.

  "title": "Is Chuy out of step with the progressive movement? Black and brown leaders weigh in",
  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union.

Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior.

Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early.

So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines.

I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "Lightfoot calls CPS teacher emails a \u2018mistake\u2019",
  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired.

  "date": "2022-09-21",
  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald.

Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council.

The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas.

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education.

Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests.

One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored.

In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council.

During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M.

  "title": "Lightfoot calls CPS teacher emails a \u2018mistake\u2019",
  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used.

From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge.

He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there.

In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019.

When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day.

She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day.

She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day.

She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day.

She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day.

She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony.

And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "title": "FALSE ALARMS: A recurring trauma for many on house arrest in Cook County",
  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website.

She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx.

In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case.

This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5.

No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx.

In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case.

This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5.

No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx.

In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case.

This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County.
