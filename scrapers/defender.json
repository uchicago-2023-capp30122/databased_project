  "text": "The three liberal Supreme Court Justices said in their joint opinion, \u201cWith sorrow \u2014 for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection\u2014we dissent.\u201dIn a televised press conference President Biden said no executive order could reverse this decision but encouraged Americans to make their opinions known during the election season. \u201cThis fall, Roe is on the ballot-Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, and equality \u2014 they\u2019re all on the ballot. Until then, I will do all in my power to protect a woman\u2019s right in states where they will face the consequences of today\u2019s decision.\u201dFormer President, Barack Obama said on Twitter, \u201cToday, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, but it also relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues\u2014attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.\u201dThe SCOTUS decision centers on a case about a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In 2018, Mississippi passed the \u201cGestational Age Act\u201d, which blocked abortions after 15 weeks with the exception of medical emergencies or severe fetal abnormality. The act was blocked by two federal courts. Mississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court arguing that the law should be upheld, and Roe V Wade should be overturned.Illinois is still a state committed to protecting women\u2019s access to abortion and other reproductive care. Illinois Governor, JB Pritzker said, \u201cToday, in a direct assault on the right to privacy and self-determination,\nthe United States Supreme Court confirmed our worst fears on Roe vs Wade. The Republican Party and the extremists they appointed to the Supreme Court have satisfied their goal. However, to women everywhere: abortion is still safe and legal in Illinois.Mayor Lori Lightfoot also issued a statement saying, \u201cI\u2019m sick to my stomach thinking about the millions of people who will be stripped of their bodily autonomy as a result of this decision. Of the women who will risk their lives trying to obtain unsafe abortions or those who will stay in dangerous situations because they don\u2019t have a better alternative. Of the young women and girls who will have less freedom than their mothers and grandmothers. What\u2019s more, this decision sets up a precedent for banning contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights. I promise you this: I will do everything in my power to protect reproductive freedom in Chicago \u2014 including for those coming out of state. As long as I am Mayor, Chicago will be a safe haven for women in need of reproductive health care.\u201dLocal lawmakers, politicians, and women\u2019s advocacy groups were quick to condemn the SCOTUS Decision. Illinois State Senator, Tammy Duckworth said in a statement, \u201cI am outraged and horrified\u2014this outcome is a nightmare that robs\u00a0women of their right to make their own choices about their healthcare and their bodies, and it paves the way for a nationwide abortion ban that Republicans have been seeking for decades.\u00a0Millions of American families\u2014including my own\u2014have relied on Roe v. Wade for almost 50 years, and 70% of Americans believe it should remain the law of the land. The Supreme Court of the United States and the Justices who claimed Roe was \u2018settled law,\u2019 but then turned around and ruled otherwise, will\u2014as Justice Sotomayor said\u2014\u2019 struggle to survive the stench\u2019 of this extreme decision.\u201d\u201cFive people I never met decided they will make health decision for my school-aged daughter, not me. Years from now, when my daughter is an adult, she will not be able to decide what happens with her body because five people she never met determined they know best. Today, the doctors and nurses, and friends who participate in a woman\u2019s decision could face criminal charges for doing nothing more than delivering their professional opinion, providing their expert care, and offering a supportive role. As the father of a teenage daughter, I am furious with the hypocritical politicians who seek to control her body and have decided that she, and every other woman in my life, and in our country, are incapable of making decisions about their own body.\u201d-Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs\u201cBy striking down Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court has turned back the clock on women\u2019s rights by denying them autonomy over their own bodies. This decision currently hurts poor, rural, and disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, but it has the potential to affect every woman in this country as it opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban,\u201d said Rep. Rush. \u201cIf the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers and children instead of prohibiting healthcare access and oppressing women.\u201d- Congressman Bobby Rush\u201cToday is a devastating day with the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Let\u2019s be clear what this decision will not do \u2013 it will not prevent women from seeking abortions. What this decision will do is force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term or seek dangerous and unregulated means for an abortion. This decision will disproportionately impact women of color and poor women, like all policies built on inequity. It also removes all women\u2019s right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Under this ruling, contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights are now under attack. Illinois and Cook County will remain a safe haven for women, but as we deal with this harsh reality, we must continue to strengthen our resolve and fight back.\u201d- Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle\u201cNot only am I disgusted that the highest court in the land has stripped women and gender-nonconforming people of our reproductive healthcare rights despite the fact that the majority of Americans support access to abortions, but I also am deeply afraid of what comes next unless Democrats fight back with everything we\u2019ve got. \u2013 1st Congressional District Candidate, Jacqui CollinsIllinois 7th Congressional Candidate Kina Collins said, \u201cThis ruling is everything we feared. It is a violent, coordinated right-wing assault on our fundamental reproductive rights and we must do everything we can to protect abortion access in Illinois and across the country.\u201d\u201cNo one should be able to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body, and I will always stand with women and fight for their right to determine their health choices. Elections matter and this decision is only the beginning. This should be a wake-up call to Americans across our country that who we have in the White House, in Congress, and in our state, legislatures are the difference between keeping our fundamental rights and having them stripped away. Democrats and people of goodwill need to get out and vote accordingly.\u201d\u00a0 \u201c-1st District Congressional Candidate Jonathan Swain\u201cIt is appalling that the Supreme Court has sought to criminalize women and doctors, even in cases where a woman or girl has been victimized by rape or incest. And this will not stop here \u2013 voting rights and marriage equality will be next. Make no mistake, these rights are now in the hands of the people we elect to Congress. I will be a tireless advocate for codifying Roe V. Wade into law and protecting women and doctors.\u201d-1st Congressional District Candidate, Karin Norington-Reaves\u201cAs Illinois closes in on Primary Election Day, today\u2019s decision is a grave reminder that voting matters. Elections matter. Donald Trump gave us three politically conservative justices on the Supreme Court: Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett \u2013 the consequences of which will be felt for generations to come.\u201d- Mayoral Candidate Kam BucknerThe American Medical Association also expressed displeasure with the ruling saying, \u201cThe American Medical Association is deeply disturbed by the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn nearly a half-century of precedent protecting patients\u2019 right to critical reproductive health care \u2014 representing an egregious allowance of government intrusion into the medical examination room, a direct attack on the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship, and a brazen violation of patients\u2019 rights to evidence-based reproductive health services. States that end legal abortion will not end abortion \u2014 they will end safe abortion, risking devasting consequences, including patients\u2019 lives.The overturning of Roe v Wade could have long-reaching effects when it comes to privacy protections and civil rights. In the Supreme Court ruling, the majority said that other rulings should be reconsidered.\u201cWe should reconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold (which prevents states from making contraception illegal), Lawrence (which decriminalized consensual sex between people of the same sex), and Obergefell (which ruled Gay Marriage legal) because any substantive due process decision is \u2018demonstrably erroneous,\u201d said Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The 14th amendment covers the right to privacy across a variety of personal freedoms.This ruling is especially damaging to the poor, minority, and immigrant communities.\u00a0 Clinics that offer preventative care in addition to abortions could close or have limited access. These clinics and facilities often supply pap smears, breast exams, contraceptive care, and more to the uninsured and underserved. With the maternal mortality rate for Black women almost three times that of whites, experts fear those rates will climb.With a conservative Supreme Court that now includes three Trump-appointed judges, and a more extreme GOP, the erosion of personal freedoms for Americans remains a real threat and an item that is sure to be a huge talking point in midterm elections.\u00a0",

  "title": "Mayor Lightfoot Makes Case For Second Term",
  "text": "Lightfoot is facing stiff competition with eight challengers \u2013 including six Black candidates \u2013 looking to unseat her after one full term in office on Election Day 2023 in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 28.\u201cWhy me as opposed to anyone else who is running? I\u2019ll tell you why. Number one there\u2019s no other Black candidate that has a shot of even getting into the runoff and is never going to see the inside of City Hall other than being invited as a guest,\u201d said Lightfoot in her opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. You can look at the polls, you can slice the numbers 20 ways from Sunday, but fundamentally any vote coming out of Black Chicago that\u2019s not for Lori Lightfoot is giving it to [Paul] Villas or Chuy [Garcia].\u201dThe Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among other publications for a 90-minute sit-down conversation with the mayor held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood. During the interview, Lightfoot addressed criticism levied against her by her political opponents, defended her record of accomplishments as mayor, discussed elements from her most recently passed budget, and more.The Defender recently participated in round-table interviews with mayoral candidate Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Vallas.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: Do you support reparations for Black Chicago? If not, what does that look like?LIGHTFOOT: Reparations is called INVEST SOUTH/WEST. Reparations is called the procurement reforms that we\u2019ve done to make sure that larger chunks of the city\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars are going into Black and brown Chicago. Reparations is called the $31 million that we put into mostly Black Chicago through our targeted financial assistance, meaning $500 a month for 5,000 families for a year and helping them overcome the financial challenges that they have to make sure that when that pilot program is over, they\u2019re in a better position than where they were before. Everything that I am doing is focused on equity and inclusion. Some people want to call it reparation. That\u2019s fine. I call it building Black wealth.\u00a0Q: What\u2019s the plan moving forward for environmental issues in Chicago?LIGHTFOOT: Let me start with how much money that we\u2019ve invested in all things environmental, specifically focused on environmental justice, 188 million dollars, the largest investment in environmental policy in concrete things in the history of the city. But let me step back. When I came into office, it wasn\u2019t just that the prior administration disbanded theDepartment of Environment, we had stepped back from any leadership role, any environmental justice, environmental integrity, climate action, you name it. We were nowhere as a city\u2026 The other thing that we have done is make sure that we\u2019re preserving Lake Michigan. It was very difficult to get done through the Trump Administration, but we finally got it done with the help of Senator Dick Durbin, which is to get the Army Corps of engineering to get the money to get for a study that is critical to doing the revetment work to stop the flooding that\u2019s happening in areas of our city on the Far North Side, but also on the Far South Side that didn\u2019t have that revetment for 20 some years. For example, every time there\u2019s a storm on Lake Michigan, you can see the flooding three blocks in from the lake. Basements of buildings being flooded, cars being flooded, streets being flooded. We finally were able to get the work of revetment started.\u00a0Q: You received $29 million from Congressman Danny Davis for health care training. We were talking about health care disparities. Have you had a chance to reflect on that and put minorities into the pipeline?LIGHTFOOT: So, a couple of things that we did along that line. I mentioned there were some silver linings, even in the very dark cloud of COVID. We knew that we needed to build up a community healthcare corps because I can come and knock on your door and you\u2019re not going to answer. But if you\u2019ve got a neighbor that you know and you trust, you\u2019re going to open up that door. Not only are you going to open up that door, you\u2019re going to have a conversation. And one of the biggest challenges that we faced during the first two years of COVID was getting people educated about the disease. We had to do a lot of myth busting. You may remember that a lot of Black folks said Black people can\u2019t get COVID. The truth is the first person who died in our city was a middle-aged Black woman. We had to do a lot of work, but what we learned was we have to have troops on the ground who are trusted in the community to be able to get the message out, to be able to knock down people\u2019s mess myths about the healthcare system and get them to be proactive about taking care of themselves. We couldn\u2019t do that from the top down, we needed to do that at the block level. So, we hired 600 community health care workers in 2020 and mostly what they were doing initially was helping us reach out to educate, communicate, and the vast majority of them are Black and brown. I think an overwhelming number are Black. The idea wasn\u2019t to just have 600 people that the city paid, but to get them real careers in health care and be that community healthcare force that we knew we were going to need on a going forward basis for public health. So, I think that that has been a tremendous success, but it\u2019s given us insights that\u2019s invaluable for us to know how we do service delivery. How do we reach people? How do we connect them up to services? We borrowed that model, if you will, from West Side United.\u00a0Q: Do you support an elected school board?LIGHTFOOT: I do support an elected school board. I do not support the legislation that was passed. And I\u2019m happy to spend another succession going chapter and verse on that, not in the least of which is they don\u2019t account for that symbiotic financial relationship between the city and Chicago Public Schools (CPS). No one\u2019s going to continue to pay what is in excess of half a billion dollars every year to CPS if they don\u2019t have any say in the governance of CPS. I don\u2019t give anybody money that I don\u2019t have some say in how that money is being spent.\u00a0Q: How much money has Chicago received in cannabis taxes? How has it been allocated?LIGHTFOOT: We get a tiny, tiny bit of cannabis money. It is three percent. That\u2019s a conversation for another day whether or not that\u2019s fair. I just happen to think it\u2019s not. We getthree percent of the revenue for cannabis, and, as you know, the cannabis industry is just exploding. What are we doing with the money? We put it right back into violence interruption and prevention. All of those dollars are going there.\u00a0Q: One thing that I am sure that is still on your list is the mental health situation. You promised to do something about mental health.LIGHTFOOT: Seventy-seven neighborhoods as of 2022 all have free mental health services.",

We were nowhere as a city\u2026 The other thing that we have done is make sure that we\u2019re preserving Lake Michigan. It was very difficult to get done through the Trump Administration, but we finally got it done with the help of Senator Dick Durbin, which is to get the Army Corps of engineering to get the money to get for a study that is critical to doing the revetment work to stop the flooding that\u2019s happening in areas of our city on the Far North Side, but also on the Far South Side that didn\u2019t have that revetment for 20 some years. For example, every time there\u2019s a storm on Lake Michigan, you can see the flooding three blocks in from the lake. Basements of buildings being flooded, cars being flooded, streets being flooded. We finally were able to get the work of revetment started.\u00a0Q: You received $29 million from Congressman Danny Davis for health care training. We were talking about health care disparities. Have you had a chance to reflect on that and put minorities into the pipeline?LIGHTFOOT: So, a couple of things that we did along that line. I mentioned there were some silver linings, even in the very dark cloud of COVID. We knew that we needed to build up a community healthcare corps because I can come and knock on your door and you\u2019re not going to answer. But if you\u2019ve got a neighbor that you know and you trust, you\u2019re going to open up that door. Not only are you going to open up that door, you\u2019re going to have a conversation. And one of the biggest challenges that we faced during the first two years of COVID was getting people educated about the disease. We had to do a lot of myth busting. You may remember that a lot of Black folks said Black people can\u2019t get COVID. The truth is the first person who died in our city was a middle-aged Black woman. We had to do a lot of work, but what we learned was we have to have troops on the ground who are trusted in the community to be able to get the message out, to be able to knock down people\u2019s mess myths about the healthcare system and get them to be proactive about taking care of themselves. We couldn\u2019t do that from the top down, we needed to do that at the block level. So, we hired 600 community health care workers in 2020 and mostly what they were doing initially was helping us reach out to educate, communicate, and the vast majority of them are Black and brown. I think an overwhelming number are Black. The idea wasn\u2019t to just have 600 people that the city paid, but to get them real careers in health care and be that community healthcare force that we knew we were going to need on a going forward basis for public health. So, I think that that has been a tremendous success, but it\u2019s given us insights that\u2019s invaluable for us to know how we do service delivery. How do we reach people? How do we connect them up to services? We borrowed that model, if you will, from West Side United.\u00a0Q: Do you support an elected school board?LIGHTFOOT: I do support an elected school board. I do not support the legislation that was passed. And I\u2019m happy to spend another succession going chapter and verse on that, not in the least of which is they don\u2019t account for that symbiotic financial relationship between the city and Chicago Public Schools (CPS). No one\u2019s going to continue to pay what is in excess of half a billion dollars every year to CPS if they don\u2019t have any say in the governance of CPS. I don\u2019t give anybody money that I don\u2019t have some say in how that money is being spent.\u00a0Q: How much money has Chicago received in cannabis taxes? How has it been allocated?LIGHTFOOT: We get a tiny, tiny bit of cannabis money. It is three percent. That\u2019s a conversation for another day whether or not that\u2019s fair. I just happen to think it\u2019s not. We getthree percent of the revenue for cannabis, and, as you know, the cannabis industry is just exploding. What are we doing with the money? We put it right back into violence interruption and prevention. All of those dollars are going there.\u00a0Q: One thing that I am sure that is still on your list is the mental health situation. You promised to do something about mental health.LIGHTFOOT: Seventy-seven neighborhoods as of 2022 all have free mental health services.",

  "text": "Lightfoot is facing stiff competition with eight challengers \u2013 including six Black candidates \u2013 looking to unseat her after one full term in office on Election Day 2023 in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 28.\u201cWhy me as opposed to anyone else who is running? I\u2019ll tell you why. Number one there\u2019s no other Black candidate that has a shot of even getting into the runoff and is never going to see the inside of City Hall other than being invited as a guest,\u201d said Lightfoot in her opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. You can look at the polls, you can slice the numbers 20 ways from Sunday, but fundamentally any vote coming out of Black Chicago that\u2019s not for Lori Lightfoot is giving it to [Paul] Villas or Chuy [Garcia].\u201dThe Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among other publications for a 90-minute sit-down conversation with the mayor held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood. During the interview, Lightfoot addressed criticism levied against her by her political opponents, defended her record of accomplishments as mayor, discussed elements from her most recently passed budget, and more.The Defender recently participated in round-table interviews with mayoral candidate Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Vallas.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: Do you support reparations for Black Chicago? If not, what does that look like?LIGHTFOOT: Reparations is called INVEST SOUTH/WEST. Reparations is called the procurement reforms that we\u2019ve done to make sure that larger chunks of the city\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars are going into Black and brown Chicago. Reparations is called the $31 million that we put into mostly Black Chicago through our targeted financial assistance, meaning $500 a month for 5,000 families for a year and helping them overcome the financial challenges that they have to make sure that when that pilot program is over, they\u2019re in a better position than where they were before. Everything that I am doing is focused on equity and inclusion. Some people want to call it reparation. That\u2019s fine. I call it building Black wealth.\u00a0Q: What\u2019s the plan moving forward for environmental issues in Chicago?LIGHTFOOT: Let me start with how much money that we\u2019ve invested in all things environmental, specifically focused on environmental justice, 188 million dollars, the largest investment in environmental policy in concrete things in the history of the city. But let me step back.

  "text": "Johnson is one of eight challengers vying to unseat incumbent mayor Lori Lightfoot. The Defender recently participated in a round-table conversation with former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Villas. Election Day 2023 in Chicago is Tuesday, Feb. 28.The Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among others for the sit-down conversation held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood.Johnson discussed his vision for Chicago Public Schools, his budget for Black Chicago, how he would address missing Black women and girls, environmental justice and urban farming, Chicago police, among other topics.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: How do you understand food as playing a role in environmental justice? If elected as mayor, how would you incorporate food justice into your environmental plan? Could you elaborate on the Green New Deal and what it looks like for Chicago?JOHNSON: I\u2019m going to support what is going to be a cumulative study so that we have a full understanding of the environmental needs for the city of Chicago. I am confident we can do that within the first 100 days. I\u2019m not going to be the type of mayor that dictates. That\u2019s not my style. I believe in co-governance.As far as co-ops, urban farms and gardens, I think it plays an incredible part in creating healthy, safe communities. There are a couple of examples on the southeast side of Chicago, on the West Side of Chicago, where entire neighborhoods are being supported and sustained.Talking about the Green New Deal, there are opportunities in which we can build a green economy, restore people in terms of their economic development, while also creating a safer environment for people to breathe and drink water.\u00a0Q: What is your posture on a fully elected school board versus an appointed school board?JOHNSON: The office of the mayor will not be our parents\u2019 or our grandparents\u2019 office. It won\u2019t. Because we\u2019re going to have an elected representative school board. The mayor isn\u2019t going to have absolute control over public school anymore. I fully support a fully elected school board.\u00a0Q: If elected, what are your three wishlist items? And, if you\u2019re one of the eight that\u2019s not elected, what then?JOHNSON: The first thing I\u2019m going to initiate is the most robust youth hiring program. It\u2019s going to be a year round with a direct correlation between youth employment and violence reduction. I\u2019m going to every single space where our people live and say \u2018send me names\u2019. All of the agencies and entities the fifth floor have jurisdiction over we are going to hire.Second thing is there\u2019s a ordinance right now that\u2019s been blocked by the mayor called treatment not trauma. What it would do, it would provide 24-hour access to mental health professionals to respond to the calls that are otherwise diverted to law enforcement.And the third thing is we\u2019re going to reopen the mental health centers. Here\u2019s the key: it needs to be publicly funded. So, when my term is up, it does not matter who the next mayor is, you can\u2019t shut them down because you have a different sort of ideological presentation on what type of health care services should be provided in our communityI wish it wasn\u2019t a wish list. Why are we making this so difficult? Why do we refuse to see young people?I\u2019m going to keep advocating for people, to keep pushing to support you to make sure that our people are seen. That work doesn\u2019t end on February 28.\u00a0Q: Is it correct that I read that you want to do an income tax of three percent on those getting $100,000 or more?JOHNSON: That was an error and the outlet that reported it in error has corrected it. I do know that sometimes mistakes happen. They corrected it. They got it wrong. For clarity, too, I\u2019m the only person in this race that has released a budget plan. People can talk about all their plans, but if they don\u2019t put on the table how they plan on supporting it, paying for it, then that\u2019s irresponsible. And by the way, I don\u2019t raise property taxes in my budget plan.\u00a0\u00a0Q: Can you share your thoughts about restorative justice and addressing recidivism?JOHNSON: So the one of the first things that I did on the county board was to eliminate the game. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s important. And we need to eliminate the gang database in the city of Chicago as well. It is a wicked structure. No one knows what the criteria is to get on that database. There is no structure in place that if something happens in error, like what happens in all of our industries, how to have someone\u2019s name removed. They had a person on their youngest six or eight and then someone on the list was 104 years old. Like the oldest G in the history of the world. The first law that I passed as a lead sponsor was the just housing ordinance. It eliminated discrimination against those who are seeking housing or formerly incarcerated. Now, you can only go back three years from their arrest.\u00a0Q: To follow up, does that also include in the courts as well when people are sentenced? Does that include restorative justice as well?JOHNSON: It has to. I want to make sure that we do everything in our power to prevent [incarceration]. I want to make sure I am clear about that because Cook County Jail is a homeless shelter. The sheriff talks about it being a mental health center, it\u2019s a homeless shelter. I hate how they treat our people. I do. People talk about how much they love Chicago. How about loving people?\u00a0Q: So, is there a plan in your administration to deal with human trafficking and kidnapping of Black women out of this very city?JOHNSON: When we mentioned the school closure there are over 1,000 children who are still missing from the school. When we talk about Black children who are lost or worse, unseen, I get it. It breaks my heart that we don\u2019t have a never forget hashtag. I need help with this. The disappearance of our people and our children starts before they are kidnapped.\u00a0Q: What would you do about crime?This ain\u2019t just about being tough, y\u2019all. It\u2019s about being smart. And if we\u2019re smarter about how we deploy law enforcement, we alleviate pressure on the front line by getting the folks who are on desk duty to provide more support and then alleviating law enforcement from these day-to day-interactions that don\u2019t keep our community safer, right?\u00a0Q: Who would you appoint to run Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges, and the Chicago Police Department?JOHNSON: I believe you have to be caring, collaborative, and competent. I can\u2019t tell you who. That would be premature.",

Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood.Johnson discussed his vision for Chicago Public Schools, his budget for Black Chicago, how he would address missing Black women and girls, environmental justice and urban farming, Chicago police, among other topics.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: How do you understand food as playing a role in environmental justice? If elected as mayor, how would you incorporate food justice into your environmental plan? Could you elaborate on the Green New Deal and what it looks like for Chicago?JOHNSON: I\u2019m going to support what is going to be a cumulative study so that we have a full understanding of the environmental needs for the city of Chicago. I am confident we can do that within the first 100 days. I\u2019m not going to be the type of mayor that dictates. That\u2019s not my style. I believe in co-governance.As far as co-ops, urban farms and gardens, I think it plays an incredible part in creating healthy, safe communities. There are a couple of examples on the southeast side of Chicago, on the West Side of Chicago, where entire neighborhoods are being supported and sustained.Talking about the Green New Deal, there are opportunities in which we can build a green economy, restore people in terms of their economic development, while also creating a safer environment for people to breathe and drink water.\u00a0Q: What is your posture on a fully elected school board versus an appointed school board?JOHNSON: The office of the mayor will not be our parents\u2019 or our grandparents\u2019 office. It won\u2019t. Because we\u2019re going to have an elected representative school board. The mayor isn\u2019t going to have absolute control over public school anymore. I fully support a fully elected school board.\u00a0Q: If elected, what are your three wishlist items? And, if you\u2019re one of the eight that\u2019s not elected, what then?JOHNSON: The first thing I\u2019m going to initiate is the most robust youth hiring program. It\u2019s going to be a year round with a direct correlation between youth employment and violence reduction. I\u2019m going to every single space where our people live and say \u2018send me names\u2019. All of the agencies and entities the fifth floor have jurisdiction over we are going to hire.Second thing is there\u2019s a ordinance right now that\u2019s been blocked by the mayor called treatment not trauma. What it would do, it would provide 24-hour access to mental health professionals to respond to the calls that are otherwise diverted to law enforcement.And the third thing is we\u2019re going to reopen the mental health centers. Here\u2019s the key: it needs to be publicly funded. So, when my term is up, it does not matter who the next mayor is, you can\u2019t shut them down because you have a different sort of ideological presentation on what type of health care services should be provided in our communityI wish it wasn\u2019t a wish list. Why are we making this so difficult? Why do we refuse to see young people?I\u2019m going to keep advocating for people, to keep pushing to support you to make sure that our people are seen. That work doesn\u2019t end on February 28.\u00a0Q: Is it correct that I read that you want to do an income tax of three percent on those getting $100,000 or more?JOHNSON: That was an error and the outlet that reported it in error has corrected it. I do know that sometimes mistakes happen. They corrected it. They got it wrong. For clarity, too, I\u2019m the only person in this race that has released a budget plan. People can talk about all their plans, but if they don\u2019t put on the table how they plan on supporting it, paying for it, then that\u2019s irresponsible. And by the way, I don\u2019t raise property taxes in my budget plan.\u00a0\u00a0Q: Can you share your thoughts about restorative justice and addressing recidivism?JOHNSON: So the one of the first things that I did on the county board was to eliminate the game. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s important. And we need to eliminate the gang database in the city of Chicago as well. It is a wicked structure. No one knows what the criteria is to get on that database. There is no structure in place that if something happens in error, like what happens in all of our industries, how to have someone\u2019s name removed. They had a person on their youngest six or eight and then someone on the list was 104 years old. Like the oldest G in the history of the world. The first law that I passed as a lead sponsor was the just housing ordinance. It eliminated discrimination against those who are seeking housing or formerly incarcerated. Now, you can only go back three years from their arrest.\u00a0Q: To follow up, does that also include in the courts as well when people are sentenced? Does that include restorative justice as well?JOHNSON: It has to. I want to make sure that we do everything in our power to prevent [incarceration]. I want to make sure I am clear about that because Cook County Jail is a homeless shelter. The sheriff talks about it being a mental health center, it\u2019s a homeless shelter. I hate how they treat our people. I do. People talk about how much they love Chicago. How about loving people?\u00a0Q: So, is there a plan in your administration to deal with human trafficking and kidnapping of Black women out of this very city?JOHNSON: When we mentioned the school closure there are over 1,000 children who are still missing from the school. When we talk about Black children who are lost or worse, unseen, I get it. It breaks my heart that we don\u2019t have a never forget hashtag. I need help with this. The disappearance of our people and our children starts before they are kidnapped.\u00a0Q: What would you do about crime?This ain\u2019t just about being tough, y\u2019all. It\u2019s about being smart. And if we\u2019re smarter about how we deploy law enforcement, we alleviate pressure on the front line by getting the folks who are on desk duty to provide more support and then alleviating law enforcement from these day-to day-interactions that don\u2019t keep our community safer, right?\u00a0Q: Who would you appoint to run Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges, and the Chicago Police Department?JOHNSON: I believe you have to be caring, collaborative, and competent. I can\u2019t tell you who. That would be premature.",

She fights for the rights of everybody.\u201dAs the alderperson representing parts of Downtown, the South Loop, Bronzeville (Douglas, North Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Blvd.), Kenwood, and Hyde Park, King has worked on the front lines on crime and public safety issues, and she\u2019s leading the redevelopment of the long-shuttered Michael Reese Hospital site.While other mega-developments elsewhere in the city drew large-scale protests from residents because the deals were too generous to developers and offered too little affordable housing, Ald. King brought together all parts of the community to ensure more affordable housing, a real community benefits agreement, and higher minority contractor participation.The video also touts King\u2019s leadership on reforming minority contracting as a way to build generational wealth in Black and Brown communities and provide good-paying jobs that can help break the cycle of violence. While goals for citywide minority contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects that King has worked on in her ward.\u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019ve made sure that minority contractors don\u2019t get shut out of city contracts and partner with the community to tackle the root causes of violent crime,\u201d\u00a0said King.Every community meeting she attends, every day she works with her two police commanders, every shooting incident \u2014 Sophia sees firsthand that we can\u2019t keep doing what we\u2019re doing as murders, shootings, and carjackings continue to plague our city.Before entering public service, Sophia King actively connected residents in her community to address some of the largest problems in the city. Whether fighting for youth programs as president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council, advocating for women\u2019s reproductive rights as vice president of Planned Parenthood Chicago, creating a community response to gun violence with The It\u2019s Time Organization (TITO) in the wake of Hadiya Pendleton\u2019s murder, or advocating for more inclusion in city and state contracts through Harriet\u2019s Daughters, Sophia has skillfully brought people together and engaged them in productive dialog to address complex challenges.\u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to the problems confronting Chicago. We are big enough and tough enough to tackle our most challenging problems in every neighborhood. But the only way we can do this is if we do this together. All of us. And each of us. Join me,\u201d concluded King.",
