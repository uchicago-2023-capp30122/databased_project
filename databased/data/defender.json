  "title": "Mayor Lightfoot Makes Case For Second Term",
  "text": "Lightfoot is facing stiff competition with eight challengers \u2013 including six Black candidates \u2013 looking to unseat her after one full term in office on Election Day 2023 in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 28.\u201cWhy me as opposed to anyone else who is running? I\u2019ll tell you why. Number one there\u2019s no other Black candidate that has a shot of even getting into the runoff and is never going to see the inside of City Hall other than being invited as a guest,\u201d said Lightfoot in her opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. You can look at the polls, you can slice the numbers 20 ways from Sunday, but fundamentally any vote coming out of Black Chicago that\u2019s not for Lori Lightfoot is giving it to [Paul] Villas or Chuy [Garcia].\u201dThe Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among other publications for a 90-minute sit-down conversation with the mayor held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood. During the interview, Lightfoot addressed criticism levied against her by her political opponents, defended her record of accomplishments as mayor, discussed elements from her most recently passed budget, and more.The Defender recently participated in round-table interviews with mayoral candidate Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Vallas.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: Do you support reparations for Black Chicago? If not, what does that look like?LIGHTFOOT: Reparations is called INVEST SOUTH/WEST. Reparations is called the procurement reforms that we\u2019ve done to make sure that larger chunks of the city\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars are going into Black and brown Chicago. Reparations is called the $31 million that we put into mostly Black Chicago through our targeted financial assistance, meaning $500 a month for 5,000 families for a year and helping them overcome the financial challenges that they have to make sure that when that pilot program is over, they\u2019re in a better position than where they were before. Everything that I am doing is focused on equity and inclusion. Some people want to call it reparation. That\u2019s fine. I call it building Black wealth.\u00a0Q: What\u2019s the plan moving forward for environmental issues in Chicago?LIGHTFOOT: Let me start with how much money that we\u2019ve invested in all things environmental, specifically focused on environmental justice, 188 million dollars, the largest investment in environmental policy in concrete things in the history of the city. But let me step back. When I came into office, it wasn\u2019t just that the prior administration disbanded theDepartment of Environment, we had stepped back from any leadership role, any environmental justice, environmental integrity, climate action, you name it. We were nowhere as a city\u2026 The other thing that we have done is make sure that we\u2019re preserving Lake Michigan. It was very difficult to get done through the Trump Administration, but we finally got it done with the help of Senator Dick Durbin, which is to get the Army Corps of engineering to get the money to get for a study that is critical to doing the revetment work to stop the flooding that\u2019s happening in areas of our city on the Far North Side, but also on the Far South Side that didn\u2019t have that revetment for 20 some years. For example, every time there\u2019s a storm on Lake Michigan, you can see the flooding three blocks in from the lake. Basements of buildings being flooded, cars being flooded, streets being flooded. We finally were able to get the work of revetment started.\u00a0Q: You received $29 million from Congressman Danny Davis for health care training. We were talking about health care disparities. Have you had a chance to reflect on that and put minorities into the pipeline?LIGHTFOOT: So, a couple of things that we did along that line. I mentioned there were some silver linings, even in the very dark cloud of COVID. We knew that we needed to build up a community healthcare corps because I can come and knock on your door and you\u2019re not going to answer. But if you\u2019ve got a neighbor that you know and you trust, you\u2019re going to open up that door. Not only are you going to open up that door, you\u2019re going to have a conversation. And one of the biggest challenges that we faced during the first two years of COVID was getting people educated about the disease. We had to do a lot of myth busting. You may remember that a lot of Black folks said Black people can\u2019t get COVID. The truth is the first person who died in our city was a middle-aged Black woman. We had to do a lot of work, but what we learned was we have to have troops on the ground who are trusted in the community to be able to get the message out, to be able to knock down people\u2019s mess myths about the healthcare system and get them to be proactive about taking care of themselves. We couldn\u2019t do that from the top down, we needed to do that at the block level. So, we hired 600 community health care workers in 2020 and mostly what they were doing initially was helping us reach out to educate, communicate, and the vast majority of them are Black and brown. I think an overwhelming number are Black. The idea wasn\u2019t to just have 600 people that the city paid, but to get them real careers in health care and be that community healthcare force that we knew we were going to need on a going forward basis for public health. So, I think that that has been a tremendous success, but it\u2019s given us insights that\u2019s invaluable for us to know how we do service delivery. How do we reach people? How do we connect them up to services? We borrowed that model, if you will, from West Side United.\u00a0Q: Do you support an elected school board?LIGHTFOOT: I do support an elected school board. I do not support the legislation that was passed. And I\u2019m happy to spend another succession going chapter and verse on that, not in the least of which is they don\u2019t account for that symbiotic financial relationship between the city and Chicago Public Schools (CPS). No one\u2019s going to continue to pay what is in excess of half a billion dollars every year to CPS if they don\u2019t have any say in the governance of CPS. I don\u2019t give anybody money that I don\u2019t have some say in how that money is being spent.\u00a0Q: How much money has Chicago received in cannabis taxes? How has it been allocated?LIGHTFOOT: We get a tiny, tiny bit of cannabis money. It is three percent. That\u2019s a conversation for another day whether or not that\u2019s fair. I just happen to think it\u2019s not. We getthree percent of the revenue for cannabis, and, as you know, the cannabis industry is just exploding. What are we doing with the money? We put it right back into violence interruption and prevention. All of those dollars are going there.\u00a0Q: One thing that I am sure that is still on your list is the mental health situation. You promised to do something about mental health.LIGHTFOOT: Seventy-seven neighborhoods as of 2022 all have free mental health services.",

  "text": "Johnson is one of eight challengers vying to unseat incumbent mayor Lori Lightfoot. The Defender recently participated in a round-table conversation with former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Villas. Election Day 2023 in Chicago is Tuesday, Feb. 28.The Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among others for the sit-down conversation held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood.Johnson discussed his vision for Chicago Public Schools, his budget for Black Chicago, how he would address missing Black women and girls, environmental justice and urban farming, Chicago police, among other topics.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: How do you understand food as playing a role in environmental justice? If elected as mayor, how would you incorporate food justice into your environmental plan? Could you elaborate on the Green New Deal and what it looks like for Chicago?JOHNSON: I\u2019m going to support what is going to be a cumulative study so that we have a full understanding of the environmental needs for the city of Chicago. I am confident we can do that within the first 100 days. I\u2019m not going to be the type of mayor that dictates. That\u2019s not my style. I believe in co-governance.As far as co-ops, urban farms and gardens, I think it plays an incredible part in creating healthy, safe communities. There are a couple of examples on the southeast side of Chicago, on the West Side of Chicago, where entire neighborhoods are being supported and sustained.Talking about the Green New Deal, there are opportunities in which we can build a green economy, restore people in terms of their economic development, while also creating a safer environment for people to breathe and drink water.\u00a0Q: What is your posture on a fully elected school board versus an appointed school board?JOHNSON: The office of the mayor will not be our parents\u2019 or our grandparents\u2019 office. It won\u2019t. Because we\u2019re going to have an elected representative school board. The mayor isn\u2019t going to have absolute control over public school anymore. I fully support a fully elected school board.\u00a0Q: If elected, what are your three wishlist items? And, if you\u2019re one of the eight that\u2019s not elected, what then?JOHNSON: The first thing I\u2019m going to initiate is the most robust youth hiring program. It\u2019s going to be a year round with a direct correlation between youth employment and violence reduction. I\u2019m going to every single space where our people live and say \u2018send me names\u2019. All of the agencies and entities the fifth floor have jurisdiction over we are going to hire.Second thing is there\u2019s a ordinance right now that\u2019s been blocked by the mayor called treatment not trauma. What it would do, it would provide 24-hour access to mental health professionals to respond to the calls that are otherwise diverted to law enforcement.And the third thing is we\u2019re going to reopen the mental health centers. Here\u2019s the key: it needs to be publicly funded. So, when my term is up, it does not matter who the next mayor is, you can\u2019t shut them down because you have a different sort of ideological presentation on what type of health care services should be provided in our communityI wish it wasn\u2019t a wish list. Why are we making this so difficult? Why do we refuse to see young people?I\u2019m going to keep advocating for people, to keep pushing to support you to make sure that our people are seen. That work doesn\u2019t end on February 28.\u00a0Q: Is it correct that I read that you want to do an income tax of three percent on those getting $100,000 or more?JOHNSON: That was an error and the outlet that reported it in error has corrected it. I do know that sometimes mistakes happen. They corrected it. They got it wrong. For clarity, too, I\u2019m the only person in this race that has released a budget plan. People can talk about all their plans, but if they don\u2019t put on the table how they plan on supporting it, paying for it, then that\u2019s irresponsible. And by the way, I don\u2019t raise property taxes in my budget plan.\u00a0\u00a0Q: Can you share your thoughts about restorative justice and addressing recidivism?JOHNSON: So the one of the first things that I did on the county board was to eliminate the game. Here\u2019s why that\u2019s important. And we need to eliminate the gang database in the city of Chicago as well. It is a wicked structure. No one knows what the criteria is to get on that database. There is no structure in place that if something happens in error, like what happens in all of our industries, how to have someone\u2019s name removed. They had a person on their youngest six or eight and then someone on the list was 104 years old. Like the oldest G in the history of the world. The first law that I passed as a lead sponsor was the just housing ordinance. It eliminated discrimination against those who are seeking housing or formerly incarcerated. Now, you can only go back three years from their arrest.\u00a0Q: To follow up, does that also include in the courts as well when people are sentenced? Does that include restorative justice as well?JOHNSON: It has to. I want to make sure that we do everything in our power to prevent [incarceration]. I want to make sure I am clear about that because Cook County Jail is a homeless shelter. The sheriff talks about it being a mental health center, it\u2019s a homeless shelter. I hate how they treat our people. I do. People talk about how much they love Chicago. How about loving people?\u00a0Q: So, is there a plan in your administration to deal with human trafficking and kidnapping of Black women out of this very city?JOHNSON: When we mentioned the school closure there are over 1,000 children who are still missing from the school. When we talk about Black children who are lost or worse, unseen, I get it. It breaks my heart that we don\u2019t have a never forget hashtag. I need help with this. The disappearance of our people and our children starts before they are kidnapped.\u00a0Q: What would you do about crime?This ain\u2019t just about being tough, y\u2019all. It\u2019s about being smart. And if we\u2019re smarter about how we deploy law enforcement, we alleviate pressure on the front line by getting the folks who are on desk duty to provide more support and then alleviating law enforcement from these day-to day-interactions that don\u2019t keep our community safer, right?\u00a0Q: Who would you appoint to run Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges, and the Chicago Police Department?JOHNSON: I believe you have to be caring, collaborative, and competent. I can\u2019t tell you who. That would be premature.",

  "text": "Lightfoot is facing stiff competition with eight challengers \u2013 including six Black candidates \u2013 looking to unseat her after one full term in office on Election Day 2023 in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 28.\u201cWhy me as opposed to anyone else who is running? I\u2019ll tell you why. Number one there\u2019s no other Black candidate that has a shot of even getting into the runoff and is never going to see the inside of City Hall other than being invited as a guest,\u201d said Lightfoot in her opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. You can look at the polls, you can slice the numbers 20 ways from Sunday, but fundamentally any vote coming out of Black Chicago that\u2019s not for Lori Lightfoot is giving it to [Paul] Villas or Chuy [Garcia].\u201dThe Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among other publications for a 90-minute sit-down conversation with the mayor held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood. During the interview, Lightfoot addressed criticism levied against her by her political opponents, defended her record of accomplishments as mayor, discussed elements from her most recently passed budget, and more.The Defender recently participated in round-table interviews with mayoral candidate Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Vallas.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: Do you support reparations for Black Chicago? If not, what does that look like?LIGHTFOOT: Reparations is called INVEST SOUTH/WEST. Reparations is called the procurement reforms that we\u2019ve done to make sure that larger chunks of the city\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars are going into Black and brown Chicago. Reparations is called the $31 million that we put into mostly Black Chicago through our targeted financial assistance, meaning $500 a month for 5,000 families for a year and helping them overcome the financial challenges that they have to make sure that when that pilot program is over, they\u2019re in a better position than where they were before. Everything that I am doing is focused on equity and inclusion. Some people want to call it reparation. That\u2019s fine. I call it building Black wealth.\u00a0Q: What\u2019s the plan moving forward for environmental issues in Chicago?LIGHTFOOT: Let me start with how much money that we\u2019ve invested in all things environmental, specifically focused on environmental justice, 188 million dollars, the largest investment in environmental policy in concrete things in the history of the city. But let me step back. When I came into office, it wasn\u2019t just that the prior administration disbanded theDepartment of Environment, we had stepped back from any leadership role, any environmental justice, environmental integrity, climate action, you name it. We were nowhere as a city\u2026 The other thing that we have done is make sure that we\u2019re preserving Lake Michigan. It was very difficult to get done through the Trump Administration, but we finally got it done with the help of Senator Dick Durbin, which is to get the Army Corps of engineering to get the money to get for a study that is critical to doing the revetment work to stop the flooding that\u2019s happening in areas of our city on the Far North Side, but also on the Far South Side that didn\u2019t have that revetment for 20 some years. For example, every time there\u2019s a storm on Lake Michigan, you can see the flooding three blocks in from the lake. Basements of buildings being flooded, cars being flooded, streets being flooded. We finally were able to get the work of revetment started.\u00a0Q: You received $29 million from Congressman Danny Davis for health care training. We were talking about health care disparities. Have you had a chance to reflect on that and put minorities into the pipeline?LIGHTFOOT: So, a couple of things that we did along that line. I mentioned there were some silver linings, even in the very dark cloud of COVID. We knew that we needed to build up a community healthcare corps because I can come and knock on your door and you\u2019re not going to answer. But if you\u2019ve got a neighbor that you know and you trust, you\u2019re going to open up that door. Not only are you going to open up that door, you\u2019re going to have a conversation. And one of the biggest challenges that we faced during the first two years of COVID was getting people educated about the disease. We had to do a lot of myth busting. You may remember that a lot of Black folks said Black people can\u2019t get COVID. The truth is the first person who died in our city was a middle-aged Black woman. We had to do a lot of work, but what we learned was we have to have troops on the ground who are trusted in the community to be able to get the message out, to be able to knock down people\u2019s mess myths about the healthcare system and get them to be proactive about taking care of themselves. We couldn\u2019t do that from the top down, we needed to do that at the block level. So, we hired 600 community health care workers in 2020 and mostly what they were doing initially was helping us reach out to educate, communicate, and the vast majority of them are Black and brown. I think an overwhelming number are Black. The idea wasn\u2019t to just have 600 people that the city paid, but to get them real careers in health care and be that community healthcare force that we knew we were going to need on a going forward basis for public health. So, I think that that has been a tremendous success, but it\u2019s given us insights that\u2019s invaluable for us to know how we do service delivery. How do we reach people? How do we connect them up to services? We borrowed that model, if you will, from West Side United.\u00a0Q: Do you support an elected school board?LIGHTFOOT: I do support an elected school board. I do not support the legislation that was passed. And I\u2019m happy to spend another succession going chapter and verse on that, not in the least of which is they don\u2019t account for that symbiotic financial relationship between the city and Chicago Public Schools (CPS). No one\u2019s going to continue to pay what is in excess of half a billion dollars every year to CPS if they don\u2019t have any say in the governance of CPS. I don\u2019t give anybody money that I don\u2019t have some say in how that money is being spent.\u00a0Q: How much money has Chicago received in cannabis taxes? How has it been allocated?LIGHTFOOT: We get a tiny, tiny bit of cannabis money. It is three percent. That\u2019s a conversation for another day whether or not that\u2019s fair. I just happen to think it\u2019s not. We getthree percent of the revenue for cannabis, and, as you know, the cannabis industry is just exploding. What are we doing with the money? We put it right back into violence interruption and prevention. All of those dollars are going there.\u00a0Q: One thing that I am sure that is still on your list is the mental health situation.

Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood.During the roundtable, Vallas responded to questions primarily concerning the Chicago Police Department\u2019s budget and hiring of new officers, public safety, his business agenda for Black-owned businesses, and more.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: You said you always answered the call for help, who called you in for help on this one?\u00a0VALLAS: Really, since the last election, I supported Lori and I tried to help her particularly when the teachers union struck. I tried to give her advice when COVID was approaching and it was clear the city needed to prepare financially. As I began to post and as I began to do op-ed pieces a number of people asked me to consider running again. I could put out some dramatic names, but I don\u2019t want to put any aldermen in a tight spot.\u00a0Q: I believe community police should come from people in that community. Can you respond to that? Would you look at that?\u00a0VALLAS: There is no substitute for beat integrity and that includes cops covering local beats. There were 406,000 911 calls that were not responded to last year. Thirty-two thousand were high priority calls. You got to return to community based policing where you know the cops and their badge numbers. You need to establish that kind of personal relationship. What I propose in terms of expanding the ranks and diversifying the community is something I actually proposed four years ago. And we just use the ROTC programs and military academy programs, which I proposed. Those students are among the higher performing students, all the military academies, all seven of them in Chicago, never been on the watch list. Eighty-six percent of the kids are Black and Latino. Forty-six percent of the kids are young women. The bottom line is: you could create a pipeline so that the next generation of police officers and first responders and EMTsand maybe bionics and and the next generation of nurses could actually come from those programs themselves.\u00a0Q: If you were elected, would you retain the current [Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown]?\u00a0VALLAS: Absolutely not. There are officers you all know that could step into the superintendent\u2019s rank.\u00a0\u00a0Q: Do you see the current superintendent as part of the problem?\u00a0VALLAS: Yeah, I do.Q: I was curious to know your thoughts on defunding policing and using city funds for things in terms of housing, and other things that don\u2019t involve policing whatsoever. Do you have any response to that?\u00a0VALLAS: I\u2019ll respond by saying the mayor controls 20 billion dollars in spending. She controls the city, park district, schools, airports, etc. I just want to put it into perspective that when they say \u2018oh, we\u2019re spending forty percent of the fund on policing\u2019 that\u2019s a corporate fund, that\u2019s a limited fund of the budget. So the point is, I don\u2019t think you need to increase police funding. I think you need to fill the vacancies and if you fill the vacancies, the money you\u2019ll save on overtime will probably costs. So you know, so I don\u2019t think we need to put more money [in policing]. We need to allocate that money effectively.\u00a0\u00a0Q: Would you decrease the amount that is currently being spent on policing and allocate that money into other spaces?\u00a0VALLAS: No, I wouldn\u2019t decrease it.\u00a0Q: INVEST South/West: would you put more money into it?(Note: According to the City of Chicago: \u201cINVEST South/West is an unprecedented community improvement initiative by the City of Chicago that is strategically reversing decades of systemic public and private disinvestment within the city\u2019s West and South Side neighborhoods.\u201d)\u00a0VALLAS: First, I have no problem with INVEST South/West. INVEST South/West is two-thirds [former Chicago Mayor] Rahm Emanuel. What I am talking about is INVEST South/West on steroids. Three things: by having an entity independent of politics focusing exclusively on making an investment. Secondly, I\u2019m talking about providing a permanent form of revenue \u2013 this is the community investment fund \u2013 every year whether it be casino money, or gaming, or video poker money which I would like to legalize and put in that fund, or put millions of dollars in TIFsurplus that the city could put in that fund so there could be a steady flow of capital that could be used to invest in a whole variety of things, social services, small businesses. The third thing would be land banking. We take this vacant property, idle property, and you activate it, and you turn it over to local community developers.\u00a0Q: Do you plan to reopen those six mental health clinics that Rahm Emanuel closed and Lori Lightfoot failed to reopen?\u00a0VALLAS: Yeah, well, what I said four years ago and I\u2019d say today is every police district needs to have a mental health center. So at the end of the day, Rahm Emanuel made a lot of decisions that he claimed he needed to make to save money and he really didn\u2019t. Mental health centers will pay for themselves if you\u2019re billing properly Medicaid, Medicare insurance companies. There\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t open a community based community operated and run mental health centers in each of the police districts.\u00a0Q: Would you prefer the mental health clinics be inside the police offices?\u00a0VALLAS: No, no, no. In the districts, not [inside] the [police] buildings.\u00a0Q: You mentioned on your website that you would bypass Cook County\u2019s State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx if you needed to. Could you elaborate on what you meant?\u00a0VALLAS: This is what I said on the website. I said, number one, you need to bring everybody together, you need to work with everybody. Number two is you need to be prepared and have the capacity to bypass if you think individuals are not being charged should be charged right now. Meaning you have to have a relationship with the US Attorney\u2019s Office, and you have to have and you have to have the capacity to go directly to the judges themselves. There\u2019s a lot of hate crimes, and there\u2019s a lot of crimes like witnesses being threatened and intimidated. And individuals are not being charged.\u00a0Q: So, are you directing any of these comments directly to Kim Foxx herself?\u00a0VALLAS: Whoever the state\u2019s attorney is, whether it\u2019s Kim Foxx or what\u2019s somebody who replaces Kim Foxx, that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to.",

  "title": "MAYOR LIGHTFOOT AND THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ANNOUNCE THE EXPANSION OF CITYWIDE MENTAL HEALTH NETWORK TO ALL 77 NEIGHBORHOODS",
  "text": "CHICAGO\u00a0\u2014 Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced today that the City of Chicago has successfully expanded access to publicly funded mental health services for residents in all 77 neighborhoods throughout the city. The City has continued to grow this network throughout the pandemic and is now funding no-barrier access to mental health services at a total of 177 clinics and clinical programs across all 77 Chicago community areas \u2014 along with primary and behavioral health care at 80 shelters for people experiencing homelessness. \u00a0\nCollectively known as Chicago\u2019s Trauma-Informed Centers of Care (TICC) network, the mental health providers in the network all receive city funding to complement their federal, state, county, and philanthropic funding \u2014 and all must provide no-barrier mental health services. Partners include Community Mental Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and Community-Based Organizations, along with CDPH\u2019s five directly-operated mental health clinics and new planned extension clinics in partnership with the Chicago Public Library and O\u2019Hare Airport.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I took office, the City was delivering mental health services to 3,600 adults per year and zero children in only 11 of Chicago\u2019s 77 neighborhoods,\u201d said Chicago Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot. \u201cNow, we are delivering these critical services to tens of thousands of adults and children across each of our communities. This tremendous accomplishment was made possible by CDPH and the many community partners, who share my goal of creating\u00a0a truly accessible mental healthcare system that serves all of our residents right in their own neighborhoods.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Trauma-Informed Centers of Care network provides a range of high-quality mental health services to adults, children, and families regardless of health insurance, immigration status, or ability to pay. In addition to growing the TICC network, CDPH has doubled the size of its own mental health staff from approximately 50 in 2019 to 100 staff today.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe need clinics, of course \u2014 but we also need to bring mental health services into the community to reach people who may never visit a stand-alone mental health site,\u201d said CDPH Commissioner Allison Arwady, M.D. \u201cWith twice as many positions on the CDPH mental health team, we are now embedding mental health crisis clinicians in the 911 system through the\u00a0CARE program; reaching people experiencing homelessness by funding care in shelters and outreach on the CTA; and building home-based mental health care for the highest-need Chicagoans. At the same time, we invested in the development and coordination of the TICC network. Now that we have high-quality services in every one of our 77 neighborhoods, we can more seamlessly and quickly connect Chicagoans to mental health care, regardless of their circumstances or their address. We\u2019re not done yet, but together with our partners, we are building the mental health system that Chicago has long needed.\u201d \u00a0\nSince 2019, Mayor Lightfoot and the City Council have increased the budget for mental health services more than seven-fold, from $12M in 2019 to $89M in 2023. As a result, more than 73,000 Chicagoans received City-funded mental health services in 2022, compared to 3,651 people in 2019.\u00a0Where zero children were served in 2019, the TICC community network provided vital support and services to 13,666 children in 2022.\u00a0Each TICC provider uses City funding to either establish new or augment existing mental health services.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe are proud to be a part of this partnership that helps us further our own mission of fostering health, wellness, and healing through a holistic and comprehensive system of community-based behavioral health for all Chicagoans,\u201d said Dr. Rami Nashashibi, Executive Director of the Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN). \u201cWith investments from CDPH, we have been able to hire staff and add programs to increase much-needed access to care for residents right here in Chicago Lawn, West Englewood, and across the South Side.\u201d\u00a0\nAs part of the expansion into all 77 Chicago communities, CDPH is building on its\u00a0partnership with Chicago Public Libraries\u00a0and establishing CDPH extension clinics at select Chicago Public Library locations \u2014 embedding CDPH mental health clinicians to allow residents to receive mental health counseling services at their local library.\u00a0\u00a0CDPH is also planning an extension clinic at O\u2019Hare Airport. \u00a0\nTo get connected to mental health services, please visit\u00a0mentalhealth.chicago.gov, call 211, or call the CDPH Mental Health Clinic Intake Line at 312-747-1020.\u00a0",

  "title": "Mayor Lightfoot Makes Case For Second Term",
  "text": "Lightfoot is facing stiff competition with eight challengers \u2013 including six Black candidates \u2013 looking to unseat her after one full term in office on Election Day 2023 in Chicago on Tuesday, Feb. 28.\u201cWhy me as opposed to anyone else who is running? I\u2019ll tell you why. Number one there\u2019s no other Black candidate that has a shot of even getting into the runoff and is never going to see the inside of City Hall other than being invited as a guest,\u201d said Lightfoot in her opening remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. You can look at the polls, you can slice the numbers 20 ways from Sunday, but fundamentally any vote coming out of Black Chicago that\u2019s not for Lori Lightfoot is giving it to [Paul] Villas or Chuy [Garcia].\u201dThe Defender joined journalists from The Chicago Crusader, N\u2019DIGO, among other publications for a 90-minute sit-down conversation with the mayor held at the Chicago News Weekly office located at 8348 S. Stony Island Ave. in the city\u2019s Avalon Park neighborhood. During the interview, Lightfoot addressed criticism levied against her by her political opponents, defended her record of accomplishments as mayor, discussed elements from her most recently passed budget, and more.The Defender recently participated in round-table interviews with mayoral candidate Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson and former Chicago Public Schools CEO and mayoral candidate Paul Vallas.\u00a0(Interview questions and responses have been condensed for clarity and length.)\u00a0Q: Do you support reparations for Black Chicago? If not, what does that look like?LIGHTFOOT: Reparations is called INVEST SOUTH/WEST. Reparations is called the procurement reforms that we\u2019ve done to make sure that larger chunks of the city\u2019s 3.5 billion dollars are going into Black and brown Chicago. Reparations is called the $31 million that we put into mostly Black Chicago through our targeted financial assistance, meaning $500 a month for 5,000 families for a year and helping them overcome the financial challenges that they have to make sure that when that pilot program is over, they\u2019re in a better position than where they were before. Everything that I am doing is focused on equity and inclusion. Some people want to call it reparation. That\u2019s fine. I call it building Black wealth.\u00a0Q: What\u2019s the plan moving forward for environmental issues in Chicago?LIGHTFOOT: Let me start with how much money that we\u2019ve invested in all things environmental, specifically focused on environmental justice, 188 million dollars, the largest investment in environmental policy in concrete things in the history of the city. But let me step back. When I came into office, it wasn\u2019t just that the prior administration disbanded theDepartment of Environment, we had stepped back from any leadership role, any environmental justice, environmental integrity, climate action, you name it. We were nowhere as a city\u2026 The other thing that we have done is make sure that we\u2019re preserving Lake Michigan. It was very difficult to get done through the Trump Administration, but we finally got it done with the help of Senator Dick Durbin, which is to get the Army Corps of engineering to get the money to get for a study that is critical to doing the revetment work to stop the flooding that\u2019s happening in areas of our city on the Far North Side, but also on the Far South Side that didn\u2019t have that revetment for 20 some years. For example, every time there\u2019s a storm on Lake Michigan, you can see the flooding three blocks in from the lake. Basements of buildings being flooded, cars being flooded, streets being flooded. We finally were able to get the work of revetment started.\u00a0Q: You received $29 million from Congressman Danny Davis for health care training. We were talking about health care disparities. Have you had a chance to reflect on that and put minorities into the pipeline?LIGHTFOOT: So, a couple of things that we did along that line. I mentioned there were some silver linings, even in the very dark cloud of COVID. We knew that we needed to build up a community healthcare corps because I can come and knock on your door and you\u2019re not going to answer. But if you\u2019ve got a neighbor that you know and you trust, you\u2019re going to open up that door. Not only are you going to open up that door, you\u2019re going to have a conversation. And one of the biggest challenges that we faced during the first two years of COVID was getting people educated about the disease. We had to do a lot of myth busting. You may remember that a lot of Black folks said Black people can\u2019t get COVID. The truth is the first person who died in our city was a middle-aged Black woman. We had to do a lot of work, but what we learned was we have to have troops on the ground who are trusted in the community to be able to get the message out, to be able to knock down people\u2019s mess myths about the healthcare system and get them to be proactive about taking care of themselves. We couldn\u2019t do that from the top down, we needed to do that at the block level. So, we hired 600 community health care workers in 2020 and mostly what they were doing initially was helping us reach out to educate, communicate, and the vast majority of them are Black and brown. I think an overwhelming number are Black. The idea wasn\u2019t to just have 600 people that the city paid, but to get them real careers in health care and be that community healthcare force that we knew we were going to need on a going forward basis for public health. So, I think that that has been a tremendous success, but it\u2019s given us insights that\u2019s invaluable for us to know how we do service delivery. How do we reach people? How do we connect them up to services? We borrowed that model, if you will, from West Side United.\u00a0Q: Do you support an elected school board?LIGHTFOOT: I do support an elected school board. I do not support the legislation that was passed. And I\u2019m happy to spend another succession going chapter and verse on that, not in the least of which is they don\u2019t account for that symbiotic financial relationship between the city and Chicago Public Schools (CPS). No one\u2019s going to continue to pay what is in excess of half a billion dollars every year to CPS if they don\u2019t have any say in the governance of CPS.

  "text": "CHICAGO \u2014\u00a0Today, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot and Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) Commissioner Brandie Knazze announced that domestic workers and undocumented residents are now eligible to apply for the Chicago Resiliency Fund 2.0, which will provide one-time, $500 relief payments to populations that had difficulties accessing and qualifying for federal relief payments during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0The City plans to award relief payments to up to 7,000 domestic workers and 10,000 undocumented residents.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCare workers are the backbone of our economy \u2014 they make all other work possible. As a daughter of a domestic worker, I know the challenges they face day in and day out to support other families while trying to keep their own afloat,\u201d said Mayor Lightfoot. \u201cThis fund represents the continued commitment from my administration to ensure that our hardest-hit residents, including domestic workers and undocumented residents, get access to recovery funds.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0To be eligible, applicants must be a domestic worker or undocumented resident, live in Chicago, be 18 or older, and have household income at or below 300% of the Federal Poverty Level ($69,090 for a household of 3). The Chicago Resiliency Fund 2.0 is open to all eligible Chicago residents, regardless of legal immigration status. No questions will be asked regarding citizenship or immigration status in the application or verification process. COVID-19 cash assistance is not considered under public charge analysis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applications must be submitted online at\u00a0www.chicash.org.\u00a0The application is currently available in English and Spanish. Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Arabic, and Polish translations are forthcoming. DFSS has engaged Heartland Human Care Services, YWCA Metropolitan Chicago, and a wide array of community-based organizations to offer information and application assistance events across the city during the application process. Community organizations who want to help engage their communities should visit the website to access outreach materials, sign up to host an event using the Partner Form linked on the website, and to register for one of the upcoming virtual information session on Thursday, February 2, from 12 to 1 p.m. or Saturday, February 4, from 10 to 11 a.m. \u00a0\n\u201cWhile the COVID stimulus payments were a great help for so many during the pandemic, many hard-working residents were left out of this critical resource,\u201d said DFSS Commissioner Brandie Knazze. \u201cThe Resiliency Fund 2.0 is designed to help those who had to navigate the pandemic without such resources. We are grateful to our nonprofit partners for their support in helping our residents to access this financial assistance and to promote an equitable recovery from COVID-19.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe YWCA is proud to partner with the City of Chicago on community outreach and application assistance for this historic program, leading a coalition of partners, including ARISE Chicago and others,\u201d said Nicole Robinson, CEO, YWCA Metropolitan Chicago. \u201cAs a trusted resource for communities across Chicagoland, we can help elevate visibility of this program and help ensure that those who qualify have the opportunity to successfully apply. As an organization focused on driving economic equity, we\u2019re thrilled to be connecting those in need with financial assistance to help meet the needs of their families.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The term \u201cdomestic worker\u201d refers to those who in the last 12 months have been paid for household services such as childcare or housekeeping which take place in a private home or residence. \u201cUndocumented resident\u201d refers to anyone residing in the United States without immigration status, and who lacks a social security number valid for employment. At this time, DACA recipients and new arrivals on humanitarian parole are not eligible to receive funds.\u00a0\u00a0Applicants will be approved on a rolling basis and will need to submit proof of eligibility.\u00a0Eligible applicants who were living in the United States in 2020 and 2021 and who have not received any previous COVID-19 cash assistance from the State of Illinois\u2019 Welcoming Center COVID-19 Recovery Fund or from the Immigrant Family Support Project will be given priority for this fund.\u00a0Up to two applications per household will be accepted. \u00a0\u00a0For more information about eligibility and the application, residents should visit\u00a0www.chicash.org\u00a0to review the FAQs, find helpdesk contact information, and find an upcoming information or assistance event in their community. \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs part of Heartland\u2019s mission to secure equity and opportunity for all, we are thrilled to partner with the City to serve as program administrator for the Chicago Resiliency Fund 2.0,\u201d said David Sinski, Executive Director of Heartland Human Care Services. \u201cWe believe that the Fund will help those who have been unable to receive traditional cash assistance secure a little more stability in their lives as they continue to recover from the pandemic\u2019s impact.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The Chicago Resiliency Fund 2.0 is still accepting and processing applications from eligible households who claimed an adult dependent in their 2019 taxes, such as a college student or disabled relative. Spouses are not considered a dependent. For this application, also accessible on\u00a0www.chicash.org, the tax filer should apply on behalf of the household and be prepared to upload a copy of their 2019 tax return or tax transcript. Residents should take care to navigate to the correct application based on their eligibility category. \u00a0\nIn 2020, Mayor Lightfoot launched the\u00a0Your Home is Someone\u2019s Workplace\u00a0campaign to bring awareness to the rights of domestic workers and to ensure they are treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. In 2021, Mayor Lightfoot led efforts to expedite domestic workers to the $15/hour minimum wage by August 2021 and passed key legislation requiring all domestic workers to have a written contract. In 2022 and 2023, the City has funded direct outreach to domestic workers to equip them with information about their rights and to act as peer leaders in their communities. \u00a0\nUnder Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s administration, Chicago was\u00a0ranked number one\u00a0for socioeconomic integration and pro-immigration policies out of the hundred largest cities in the US. The Office of New Americans works to engage and promote the wellbeing of diverse immigrant and refugee communities throughout the city and supports City departments in ensuring full and equal access to social services.\u00a0\nThe Chicago Resiliency Fund 2.0 is part of the $1.9B\u00a0Chicago Recovery Plan\u00a0bucket of investments and represents a continued commitment from the City of Chicago to center households in the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund is modeled after the 2020\u00a0Chicago Resiliency Fund, which was a public-partner partnership between the City of Chicago, The Resurrection Project and Open Society Foundation that provided cash assistance to residents excluded from the first federal stimulus payments. The first round of Resiliency Fund 2.0 offered cash assistance payments for caretakers of adults who filed taxes in 2019.",

  "text": "\nCHICAGO \u2014\u00a0Today, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot joined Chicago Police Department Superintendent David O. Brown, Chicago Fire Department Commissioner Annette Nance-Holt, Alderman Emma Mitts (37th\u00a0Ward), Dr. Elizabeth Lockhart, and community partners to cut the ribbon on the recently completed Public Safety Training Center (PSTC). This cutting-edge training center will provide the cities\u2019 first responders with the most modern facilities to hone their skills for\u00a0emergency response situations, investigations, and tactical operations.\n\u201cTo make Chicago the safest big city in the country, we must invest in both our first responders and in our neighborhoods,\u201d said Mayor Lightfoot. \u201cThe Public Safety Training Center is a demonstration of these commitments, and was created in partnership with public safety experts and the community in mind. The PSTC will help deliver a new generation of police officers and firefighters, and the businesses developed around it will contribute to more meaningful investments in the West Humboldt Park neighborhood.\u201d\nThe Public Safety Training Center features a six-story tower with each floor simulating different environment firefighters encounter daily, including apartments, hotels, and office buildings. The center also includes an indoor and outdoor scenario village replicating a four-way intersection common in most neighborhoods. The departments will use this scenario village to train first responders on how to respond to various emergency calls.\n\u201cOpening the new Public Safety Training Center represents a public safety milestone for the city of Chicago with collaborative education, and sophisticated training and tools for the next generation of first responders and current police officers alike,\u201d said CPD Superintendent David O. Brown. \u201cThis campus is both an investment in the community and active part of this community that will engage and inspire youth and grow trust while connecting residents.\u201d\n\u201cHaving proudly served 32 years so far in the fire department, I understand fully what a firehouse can mean to a community and I\u2019m confident this facility will be an anchor in this neighborhood,\u201d said Commissioner Nance-Holt. \u201cSharing this location with Boys & Girls Club is truly a blessing. As children are coming and going from their club activities, they might get a chance to see first responders who they can relate to and hopefully spark a dream to one day serve this great city as a Firefighter, Paramedic, or Police Officer.\u201d\nThe facility sits on a 30.4-acre former rail yard that, prior to the City\u2019s purchase in 2017, had been sitting vacant for more than 40 years.\u00a0In addition to the main academy building, the site will also host two minority-owned restaurants, Peach\u2019s and Culvers, as well as a 27,000-square-foot Boys and Girls Club that are all slated to open this summer. The purpose of these establishments is to provide an economic pillar point for the community.\u00a0Combined, the PSTC, the Boys and Girls Club, and the Culver\u2019s and Peach\u2019s restaurants represent approximately $170M in public and private investments in this community.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud the Public Safety Training Center is in West Humboldt Park and that our community will play a role in serving hundreds of recruits tasked with protecting the city,\u201d said Alderman Emma Mitts (37th\u00a0Ward). \u201cThe PSTC is critical to public safety and training firefighters and police officers. Additionally, the facility is attracting businesses\u00a0like Culver\u2019s and Peach\u2019s restaurants\u00a0and\u00a0organizations like the\u00a0Boys and Girls Club\u00a0to our neighborhood, ensuring more job opportunities for our residents.\u201dThe\u00a0PSTC\u00a0is situated between two Invest South/West \u2013 one in Austin and the other in West Humboldt Park \u2013 that will see $95M in new private investment in the coming years. This investment will radiate from this building toward Austin and West Humboldt Park, and vice versa, connecting neighborhoods and creating a lively corridor with new businesses, living-wage jobs, and better housing.",

  "text": "CHICAGO \u2014\u00a0Today, Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot and City Comptroller Reshma Soni launched the 2023 Administrative Debt Relief (ADR) Pilot Program. Available immediately, the program provides a course for Chicagoans mired in debt stemming from Administrative Hearing violations \u2014 some of which disproportionately impact low-income communities and are associated with higher fees than other municipal debt.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cLike many major cities nationwide, Chicago\u2019s fines and fees structure had been historically regressive, but my administration continues to prioritize providing pathways for our residents to get out of debt into economic stability,\u201d said Mayor Lightfoot. \u201cThe Administrative Debt Relief Pilot Program builds upon the successes of several widely used existing debt-relief programs that helped to lift heavy financial burdens for tens of thousands of Chicagoans. I look forward to the implementation of this program that will move us closer to our ultimate goal of alleviating poverty in our city.\u201d\u00a0\nAdministrative Hearing debts include but are not limited to those resulting from violations issued by the Departments of Streets and Sanitation, Police, Buildings, and Business Affairs and Consumer Protection. The program builds on the success of the City\u2019s ongoing fines and fees reforms and debt relief efforts, including the Clear Path Relief (CPR) program for vehicle tickets and the Utility Billing Relief (UBR) program for sewer and water bills.\u00a0\n\u201cSince Mayor Lightfoot came into office in 2019, the City has implemented a vast array of fines and fees reforms to help individuals come into compliance. The ADR program is yet another way we are providing an opportunity to help ease the financial burden of debt weighing down individuals and small businesses,\u201d said City Comptroller Reshma Soni. \u201cOur goal is to help pave a viable road to economic stability. This progressive reform offers two options for those seeking to come into compliance but may have distinct needs in order to fulfill their financial obligations.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Department of Finance is tasked with administering each of the program\u2019s two phases. The first, Standard Relief, does not require an application and allows individuals or businesses to pay the original fine amount in full, or enroll in a payment plan. The second phase, Hardship Relief, allows income-eligible applicants to receive a substantial discount on their original debt:\u00a0\nStandard Relief\u00a0Hardship Relief:\u00a0\u00a0\nFines and fees reform has been a priority of Mayor Lightfoot since taking office in 2019. Traditional municipal fines and fees models are regressive and disproportionately burden low-income communities and communities of color, contributing to economic inequity and perpetuating cycles of poverty.\u00a0\nUnder Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s leadership, Chicago has become a national exemplar in fines and fees reform and was among the first cities to consider the financial capabilities of its residents when assessing fines and fees. Reforms have been made with input from advocacy groups and city departments, as well as the Fines and Fees Access Collaborative, formed in 2018 and led by the City Clerk\u2019s Office. Accomplishments include:\u00a0\u00a0\nVisit\u00a0Chicago.gov/newstartchicago\u00a0to learn more about, or enroll, in the Administrative Debt Relief program and other programs.\u00a0\u00a0\n                ",
