  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Kam Buckner",
  "text": "Kam Buckner quiere recordarles a todos que \u00e9l es un hijo de Chicago. Su familia tiene ra\u00edces en Mississippi; se mudaron a Chicago durante la segunda Gran Migraci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s del brutal linchamiento de Emmett Till en las cercan\u00edas de Money, Mississippi. Buckner, de 37 a\u00f1os, se gradu\u00f3 de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago y se esta orgulloso de ser el \u00fanico candidato en la carrera por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago del 2023 que puede reclamar ese honor: asisti\u00f3 a la Escuela Primaria Clissold en Beverly y luego a la Escuela Secundaria Morgan Park.Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a la alcald\u00eda del 2023, el 2 de enero, Buckner invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a su oficina de campa\u00f1a dentro del centro comercial de 55th y Wentworth Avenue en Washington Park. Se\u00f1al\u00f3 que el \u00e1rea se vio gravemente afectado durante las protestas de verano del 2020.\u201cEn mayo del 2020, despu\u00e9s de la muerte de George Floyd y cuando el malestar social comenz\u00f3 a surgir en todo el pa\u00eds, espec\u00edficamente aqu\u00ed en Chicago, sabemos que muchos de los centros comerciales de la ciudad estaban cerrados\u201d, dijo Buckner, dirigiendo su atenci\u00f3n al mural pintado en la pieza de madera detr\u00e1s de \u00e9l dentro de la oficina. \u201cPero luego tambi\u00e9n vimos una afluencia de muchos artistas de Chicago que tambi\u00e9n pudieron usar la madera como una forma expresiva de contar sus historias. Era una hermosa obra de arte alrededor de la ciudad\u201d.Durante la entrevista, Buckner no se detuvo en el hecho de que su padre fue oficial del Departamento del Sheriff del Condado de Cook durante mucho tiempo, y que tiene un t\u00edo que fue oficial jurado de CPD y otro t\u00edo que fue empleado civil de CPD. En cambio, destac\u00f3 su trabajo como representante estatal para hacer realidad la Ley SAFE-T y la primera junta escolar electa de Chicago. Tambi\u00e9n le preguntamos sobre sus planes de vigilancia y seguridad p\u00fablica en caso de que se convierta en alcalde.\u00a0A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, se mantuvo firme en no aumentar el presupuesto de CPD si era elegido. Sin embargo, habl\u00f3 sobre llenar las posiciones vacantes existentes dentro de CPD y encontrar recursos para poner m\u00e1s detectives en las calles.Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Buckner como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(Esta entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 el crecer en su entorno su pol\u00edtica, qui\u00e9n es usted y su perspectiva de la vida hoy d\u00eda?Kam Buckner: Yo hablo mucho en esta campa\u00f1a sobre ser un hijo de Chicago. Y para m\u00ed, eso es algo grande, \u00bfverdad? Podr\u00edamos hablar sobre la universidad a la que uno fue y la universidad de derecho y todas esas cosas divertidas. Eso es solo material usado para encontrar trabajo. Pero, literalmente, ser una persona que creci\u00f3 aqu\u00ed, que se gradu\u00f3 de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago, una persona que jug\u00f3 en los parques de Chicago y fue a un campamento de verano en los parques de Chicago y fue uno de los primeros y j\u00f3venes usuarios de la Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Chicago. Chicago realmente est\u00e1 en mi ADN. Est\u00e1 en el centro de lo que soy.Y cuando hablo sobre la raz\u00f3n por la que me postulo para alcalde, cuando hablo sobre el espacio en el que me encuentro hoy, realmente se basa en lo que siento que esta ciudad ha podido brindarme a m\u00ed y a mi familia. Mi madre se mud\u00f3 aqu\u00ed desde Mississippi en 1955. De hecho, se mud\u00f3 aqu\u00ed en septiembre de 1955. Y la raz\u00f3n por la que vino aqu\u00ed fue en agosto del 1955, Emmett Till fue asesinado en el pueblo que estaba al lado del suyo. Y as\u00ed, cuando mi abuela y mi abuelo se enteraron de este ni\u00f1o Negro de Chicago, que vino a Mississippi y fue mutilado, linchado, torturado sin otra raz\u00f3n que el color de su piel, honestamente, ya hab\u00edan tenido suficiente, \u00bfverdad? Mi madre creci\u00f3 viendo linchamientos. Creci\u00f3 lidiando con las cosas que eran fundamentales para Jim Crow. Pero esa fue la gota que colm\u00f3 el vaso para mis abuelos. Y entonces empacaron a les ni\u00f1es e hicieron el viaje a Chicago en busca de seguridad y oportunidades. Y siempre me recuerdo a m\u00ed mismo que as\u00ed es como llegu\u00e9 aqu\u00ed, porque as\u00ed es como lleg\u00f3 mi familia.Se declar\u00f3 culpable de un segundo DUI a principios de este a\u00f1o y dijo que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 una lecci\u00f3n. \u00bfQu\u00e9 lecci\u00f3n aprendio del segundo DUI? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 dice sobre usted como modelo a seguir para los j\u00f3venes Negros de Chicago?He sido muy abierto y transparente sobre mis errores pasados \u200b\u200by mis pasos malos. He asumido la responsabilidad y la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas por ello. He tenido conversaciones sobre esto p\u00fablicamente con mis electores, con mi Dios y mi equipo espiritual y mi familia. Y en los cuatro a\u00f1os que han pasado desde que ocurri\u00f3 el segundo incidente, la gente del Distrito 26 me ha reelegido o ha votado por m\u00ed en cuatro elecciones diferentes desde entonces. El Portavoz de la C\u00e1mara me ha pedido dos veces que sea parte de su equipo de liderazgo. El Black Caucus me ha pedido que los presida, lo cual hice durante algunos momentos muy dif\u00edciles en el 2020. Y terminar\u00e9 mi presidencia en 10 d\u00edas aqu\u00ed. Y creo que est\u00e1 muy claro que me he convertido en una mejor persona desde entonces.Personalmente, han pasado muchas cosas para m\u00ed desde entonces; me case. Soy padre ahora. Entonces, creo que lo que quiero transmitir a los j\u00f3venes, especialmente a los j\u00f3venes Negros de Chicago, es que los errores y los malos pasos no tienen por qu\u00e9 ser su destino final, \u00bfverdad? Todos cometemos errores, y somos afortunados [de] aprender de ellos. Y podemos impartir sabidur\u00eda a otras personas y mostrarles que puedes estar deprimido, pero no est\u00e1s fuera.Creci\u00f3 con una familia muy policiaca. Usted ha dicho que apoya tanto la propuesta de GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book como un aumento en el tama\u00f1o de la fuerza policial. \u00bfQu\u00e9 partes del GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book apoyas? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo funciona eso con su plan para aumentar la fuerza policial?Mi pap\u00e1 estaba en el Departamento del Sheriff del condado de Cook. Mis t\u00edos eran CPD, tanto oficiales juramentados como empleados civiles tambi\u00e9n. Y as\u00ed, no solo apoyo el Libro de la Paz, sino que trabaj\u00e9 con GoodKids MadCity para escribir la contraparte estatal de eso: la Ley de la Paz. B\u00e1sicamente, toma el trabajo que se encuentra en la ordenanza del Libro de la Paz y lo expande a todos los departamentos de polic\u00eda del estado.Cuando hablo de llenar posiciones vacantes, no hablo de aumentar el tama\u00f1o de CPD. Hablo de vacantes que ya existen, pero tambi\u00e9n hablo de crear espacios donde la gente esta involucrada en varias funciones. Tambi\u00e9n hablo, no de un modelo de respondedor de llamadas para llamadas de salud mental como el que existe actualmente, sino de un modelo en el que los polic\u00edas no aparecen en absoluto, donde solo hay un profesional de salud mental capacitado. Creo que eso es todo lo importante para poder sacar adelante a la ciudad.Aumentar el tama\u00f1o del departamento de polic\u00eda no es la respuesta para esto. De lo que suelo hablar es de dos cosas. Veo seguridad p\u00fablica y veo vigilancia p\u00fablica. Creo que la seguridad p\u00fablica es hacer cumplir la ley. Creo que la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley debe existir para cuando suceden cosas adversas, y necesitamos una respuesta a eso. La aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley es receptiva.Desafortunadamente, he visto numerosas veces en mi familia que las personas han sido victimizadas. Mi t\u00edo del que habl\u00e9 antes, que es un empleado civil de CPD, trabajaba en el espacio de equipos en la sede en la calle 35. Y en el 2016, lo mataron a tiros mientras sacaba la compra de su autom\u00f3vil en el vecindario de Morgan Park donde crec\u00ed. Y recuerdo el proceso de pasar por el proceso con los detectives para encontrar qui\u00e9n lo hizo. Result\u00f3 ser un hombre joven, creo que ten\u00eda 16 a\u00f1os en ese momento, dispar\u00f3 al otro lado de la calle a otro joven y mi t\u00edo recibi\u00f3 un disparo. Pero estas historias son demasiado reales. Y son historias cotidianas en la ciudad. Y una vez m\u00e1s, creo que necesitamos tener un aparato que sea capaz de responder cuando sucedan estas cosas. Pero tambi\u00e9n, debemos ser preventivos y proactivos y brindar a las personas lo que necesitan para estar seguros y sentirse seguros.Cuando dices que apoyaste a GoodKids MadCity y que te gust\u00f3 la redacci\u00f3n del Libro de la Paz, \u00bfImplementar\u00e1 el Libro de la Paz?Absolutamente. Dos de las cosas que deber\u00edan ser los primeros puntos en mi plan de seguridad p\u00fablica. La ordenanza del Libro de la Paz, la implementar\u00e9. Trabajar\u00e9 para lograrlo desde el primer d\u00eda, y tambi\u00e9n la ordenanza de Anjanette Young.Los organizadores han pedido m\u00e1s medidas preventivas de salud mental para contrarrestar parte de la violencia que vemos. As\u00ed que hemos tenido esa conversaci\u00f3n muchas veces. Los l\u00edderes han tenido esta conversaci\u00f3n muchas veces, pero luego, cuando la gente asume el cargo, no vemos eso. Todav\u00eda vemos el aumento del presupuesto de la polic\u00eda. Hay llamadas para tener m\u00e1s polic\u00edas en la calle. \u00bfTiene alguna pol\u00edtica que est\u00e9 pensando en elaborar o que ya haya elaborado que realmente muestre c\u00f3mo podr\u00edan ser estas dos instituciones? Esta idea de medidas preventivas y vigilancia? Cuando mencion\u00f3 que la polic\u00eda respond\u00eda a ciertos delitos, \u00bfqu\u00e9 delitos? \u00bfC\u00f3mo funciona?Creo que tienes raz\u00f3n. Creo que nosotros, especialmente con esta alcalde actual, lo llamar\u00e9 como es. Nos vendieron una lista de bienes. Y una vez que prest\u00f3 juramento, casi de inmediato dio marcha atr\u00e1s en tantas cosas que muchos de nosotros est\u00e1bamos entusiasmados por en la ciudad. Y es decepcionante, por decir lo menos. Pero como he dicho muchas veces en esta campa\u00f1a electoral, los pol\u00edticos hacen promesas, los l\u00edderes las cumplen, lo cual esta alcalde no ha cumplido. Y entonces tenemos que responsabilizarla por eso.\u00a0En mi plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, que se llama Safer 77, siendo un gui\u00f1o a las 77 comunidades en Chicago, hablo mucho sobre asegurarme de que el CPD no se pueda enfocar de la misma manera en delitos menores, me refiero a delitos que son m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y no violentos. Tenemos una tasa de resoluci\u00f3n del 20% en homicidios. No importa d\u00f3nde caigas en esta conversaci\u00f3n, no hay nadie que me diga que est\u00e1 de acuerdo con un 80% de posibilidades de matar a alguien en Chicago y nunca tener que pagar por ello. Eso es problem\u00e1tico.\u00a0Entonces, en mi plan, hablo mucho sobre proporcionar recursos para poner m\u00e1s detectives en las calles. No se trata de alguien que te detiene por una placa vencida y luego te arresta por tener mota en el auto.Cuando dices m\u00e1s detectives en las calles, si suena como m\u00e1s vigilancia.S\u00ed. No, absolutamente. Cuando me siento con familias en mi distrito de representaci\u00f3n estatal, espec\u00edficamente familias que han perdido a j\u00f3venes, quieren m\u00e1s detectives. Una vez m\u00e1s, los detectives no son polic\u00edas que van a encerrar a la gente. No est\u00e1n llamando a tu puerta. Est\u00e1n resolviendo cr\u00edmenes y resolviendo asesinatos espec\u00edficamente.\u00a0Hace dos a\u00f1os en el D\u00eda del Trabajador, hab\u00eda un [ni\u00f1e de 4 a\u00f1os] llamado [Mychael] \"MJ\" Moultry Jr. y lo mataron en mi distrito, de hecho, lo mataron al otro lado de la calle de un parque que lleva el nombre de la madre de Emmett Till. Cierto. Y habl\u00e9 mucho con sus padres. Habl\u00e9 con ellos durante estas vacaciones, solo para ver c\u00f3mo estaban porque s\u00e9 que fue dif\u00edcil para ellos. Y cuando hablo con gente as\u00ed, y no tienen respuestas sobre la muerte de su hijo, no hay respuestas. El alcalde sali\u00f3 e hizo una conferencia de prensa. Pero luego las llamadas de CPD pararon. Y es porque dijeron que no tienen la mano de obra para hacerlo. Eso es un gran fracaso para m\u00ed.No quiero aumentar el estado policial. No creo que debamos inundar nuestras calles con m\u00e1s oficiales para vigilar de manera inconstitucional. Creo que tenemos algunos problemas reales. Si lee el decreto de consentimiento, ver\u00e1 que tenemos un largo camino por recorrer. Pero lo que s\u00ed creo es que debemos comenzar a cerrar y consolar a las familias de la ciudad que han sido v\u00edctimas de la violencia, espec\u00edficamente, como dije, a los j\u00f3venes. Si te dijera cu\u00e1nto tiempo pas\u00e9 hablando con padres que han perdido a sus hijos, es una acusaci\u00f3n realmente condenatoria de hacia d\u00f3nde hemos ido como sociedad.Su lenguaje da ley y orden. A primera vista, parece que es un candidato a favor de la polic\u00eda. Y para nuestra audiencia que puede estar tratando de decidir qui\u00e9n es el candidato m\u00e1s progresista, creo que necesitan un poco m\u00e1s de informaci\u00f3n sobre cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su inversi\u00f3n en la vigilancia. Mencion\u00f3 detectives. \u00bfHay algo mas? Cuando se trata del presupuesto de la polic\u00eda, \u00bfpuede ser espec\u00edfico acerca de c\u00f3mo cambiar los n\u00fameros?Para m\u00ed, cuando hablo de poder brindar seguridad y justicia, me estoy asegurando de que el presupuesto de CPD no vuelva a poner m\u00e1s oficiales en las calles para ocupar nuestras comunidades. Ese no es el camino a seguir. No es as\u00ed como hacemos que las personas est\u00e9n m\u00e1s seguras.Lo que tambi\u00e9n he dicho es que no podemos hablar lo suficiente sobre la violencia que est\u00e1 ocurriendo en nuestras comunidades hasta que hablemos lo suficiente sobre la violencia que ha ocurrido en nuestras comunidades. Me refiero a negligencia benigna. Me refiero a eliminar recursos. Quiero decir que est\u00e1 el cierre de m\u00e1s de 50 escuelas. Pienso [sobre] la criminalizaci\u00f3n de ser Negro. Hemos visto eso en Chicago durante demasiado tiempo. As\u00ed que tenemos que ser capaces de lidiar con esos problemas.He hablado espec\u00edficamente con hombres Negros j\u00f3venes en esta ciudad que han querido seguir una carrera en la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley. Y eso es algo que quieren hacer, porque sienten que pueden retribuir a su comunidad de esa manera. Pero a estos muchachos, ya sea porque est\u00e1n en una base de datos de pandillas o porque han tenido un cargo por marihuana, que ahora es legal, en alg\u00fan momento de sus vidas, se les ha dicho que no pueden servir a su comunidad de esa manera. Eso es problem\u00e1tico. As\u00ed que habl\u00e9 sobre eso, tambi\u00e9n en mi plan, eliminar algunas de esas barreras que han hecho que el departamento de polic\u00eda sea m\u00e1s racista y m\u00e1s monol\u00edtico de una manera que no ha sido \u00fatil para nuestras comunidades. As\u00ed que seguro que fue un gran problema para m\u00ed.\u00a0Pero tambi\u00e9n hablo de CPD que actualmente usa este modelo de co-respondedor ahora, donde es un programa piloto, pero est\u00e1n enviando a un profesional de salud mental y a un polic\u00eda cuando alguien tiene una llamada de salud mental. Para m\u00ed, eso no est\u00e1 bien, no creo que sea lo correcto. Porque si vienes a la escena en la que estoy y estoy teniendo un episodio de salud mental, quiero decir, no voy a ver al tipo con el portapapeles. Voy a ver al tipo con el arma y la placa.Cuando pienso en Quintonio LeGrier, quien fue asesinado el d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de Navidad en el 2015. El joven llam\u00f3 CPD el misno. Hizo varias llamadas diciendo que no se sent\u00eda bien. Estaba teniendo un episodio de salud mental. Y quer\u00eda ayuda. Y mandaron a dos oficiales, con las armas en la mano, a ir a ayudar a un se\u00f1or que dijo que ten\u00eda un problema y lo terminaron matando. Atravesaron a tiros el edificio de al lado y mataron a Bettie Jones, su vecina de al lado, que estaba en su sof\u00e1 viendo la televisi\u00f3n. No hay forma de que puedas hacerme pensar que un modelo de co-respondedor detiene eso, pero \u00bfsabes qu\u00e9 lo detiene? Si aparece alguien sin un arma.Entonces, cuando hablo de reposicionar el presupuesto, no he llegado a detalles muy profundos porque, como dije antes, CPD miente sobre c\u00f3mo es su presupuesto. Tienes que meterte y ver debajo, una vez que est\u00e9s en el cargo, para ver d\u00f3nde se alinean esas cosas. Pero realmente creo que tiene que haber dinero all\u00ed para que, una vez m\u00e1s, [tengamos] profesionales de la salud mental, trabajadores sociales, y que la gente pueda ser parte de las decisiones. Y hablo mucho sobre la fuerza policial y la seguridad p\u00fablica. Es porque no creo que necesites a una persona con un arma y una placa para hacer todo, y tenemos j\u00f3venes en Chicago que no quieren ser polic\u00edas pero quieren estar en el espacio de seguridad p\u00fablica de las fuerzas del orden. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no hay puestos de trabajo dentro del departamento para ellos?As\u00ed que no basta con cambiar la polic\u00eda en Chicago, tenemos que cambiar Chicago, y eso tiene que empezar con tener un liderazgo en el consejal que pueda tomar las decisiones dif\u00edciles sobre lo que estamos haciendo. No est\u00e1 aumentando el presupuesto de CPD mientras las tasas de autorizaci\u00f3n siguen bajando. No es m\u00e1s dinero en los espacios que han sido problem\u00e1ticos dada la relaci\u00f3n de CPD con la comunidad.\u00a0Yo no dir\u00eda que es pro-polic\u00eda en absoluto. Todo lo que he tratado de transmitir es realmente pro-Chicago. Lo he dicho y lo dir\u00e9 de nuevo: las comunidades de Chicago saben lo que necesitan para estar seguras. Necesitamos escuchar a la gente. Eso no est\u00e1 sucediendo actualmente. Y he hecho de eso un pilar del trabajo que quiero hacer como alcalde.CPD recibe gran parte del presupuesto de la ciudad. Con algunas de las ideas que tiene en mente, como las que acaba de mencionar con la seguridad, \u00bfc\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda cosas como esas? \u00bfDe d\u00f3nde proviene la financiaci\u00f3n?Cuando hablas de la seguridad p\u00fablica de la fuerza policial, creo que hay ciertas cosas que no se incluir\u00e1n en el presupuesto de la CPD. As\u00ed que creo que mueves algunos de esos n\u00fameros. Creo que hay formas de mover algo de lo que ya est\u00e1 en el presupuesto de CPD. Una vez m\u00e1s, CPD no ha sido muy comunicativo con respecto a d\u00f3nde est\u00e1n poniendo todo su dinero. Pero estar\u00e9 dispuesto a apostar, que es hac\u00eda art\u00edculos ciegos para militarizaci\u00f3n y equipo, como, tienen que irse. Estoy seguro de que est\u00e1 ah\u00ed. Eso tiene que irse. Entonces podemos tomar eso y poner a un trabajador social o profesional de la salud mental en las listas. Vamos a hacer eso.\u00a0Creo que parte del presupuesto es una divisi\u00f3n entre CPD y, obviamente, tambi\u00e9n el Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica de Chicago. El dinero est\u00e1 ah\u00ed.Lo que tambi\u00e9n es cierto es que nos hemos perdido muchos d\u00f3lares estatales y federales porque no hemos querido tener una infraestructura de salud mental en esta ciudad. Hay ciudades en todo el pa\u00eds (Austin, Texas, Filadelfia) que est\u00e1n recibiendo mucho dinero del gobierno federal porque tienen un plan. Y no lo hacemos, as\u00ed que nos lo estamos perdiendo, y eso cambiar\u00e1\u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente acerca de la Ley SAFE-T? \u00bfEs algo que apoya?Ayud\u00e9 a escribirla. Trabaj\u00e9 muy duro para avanzarla. He trabajado muy duro durante los \u00faltimos meses para defenderla en p\u00fablico, especialmente de las mentiras y los ataques directos a la ley. Y te dir\u00e9 esto, s\u00e9 que es monumental. Y otras personas en este pa\u00eds est\u00e1n observando para ver qu\u00e9 sucede con eso. Y continuar\u00e9 luchando por ello en Springfield y en cualquier otro lugar donde pueda.Creo que tomamos medidas valientes para desmantelar un sistema que te trata mejor si eres culpable y tienes los medios que si eres inocente y no tienes los medios. Entonces, cuando desmantelas y atacas sistemas como ese, te atacar\u00e1n de vuelta, lo cual es lo que estamos viendo hoy con la implementaci\u00f3n y el lanzamiento de la Ley SAFE-T. Pero conf\u00edo en que comenzar\u00e1 a tomar forma y la gente ver\u00e1 que nos convertimos en una sociedad m\u00e1s segura cuando no controlamos en exceso, cuando hay rendici\u00f3n de cuentas, cuando hay transparencia y cuando hay formas reales de medir el \u00e9xito.\u00bfExiste una correlaci\u00f3n entre la salud mental y la violencia en Chicago? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo piensa acerca de esta correlaci\u00f3n al redactar ideas sobre pol\u00edticas relacionadas con la seguridad y la salud mental?Creo que hay enormes correlaciones. Honestamente, les dir\u00e9, creo que ten\u00edamos un problema de salud mental en la ciudad antes de la pandemia, pero creo que solo est\u00e1 empeorando en los \u00faltimos dos, casi tres a\u00f1os, lo cual es una locura. Tenemos que ser realistas sobre el trauma perpetuo por el que hemos hecho pasar a nuestras comunidades, espec\u00edficamente a nuestros j\u00f3venes.Estaba hablando con algunos j\u00f3venes en una escuela de mi distrito, Doolittle en la calle 35. Y estos j\u00f3venes no solo ten\u00edan dos o tres compa\u00f1eros de clase que hab\u00edan muerto, asesinados a tiros en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, sino que un joven me estaba contando sobre todos los tiroteos que vio durante el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o, y lo guarda en secreto, y no hay nadie con quien puedas hablar. En la escuela, no hay nadie con quien pueda hablar en el espacio que pueda ayudarlo a superar ese trauma. Estamos poniendo este trastorno de estr\u00e9s postraum\u00e1tico en nuestros j\u00f3venes que no tienen forma de lidiar con \u00e9l.En mi plan de salud mental, solicito la reapertura de 20 centros de salud mental en la ciudad y hacer que varios de esos centros funcionen las 24 horas para que las personas puedan ingresar durante todo el d\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s, armar unidades m\u00f3viles para que las personas puedan buscar ayuda sin importar en qu\u00e9 parte de la calle se encuentren. Y creo que todo eso importa. Nos aseguraremos de hacerlo. He hablado de poner profesionales de la salud mental en todas nuestras escuelas de Chicago. Creo que eso es extremadamente importante.Y una cosa de la que no hablamos lo suficiente es la eliminaci\u00f3n de las tuber\u00edas contaminadas de plomo. Sabemos que nuestros j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n siendo envenenados. Y la ciudad ha dicho: \"Bueno, escucha, si tienes tuber\u00edas contaminadas de plomo, tienes que resolverlo t\u00fa mismo\". La verdad del asunto es que este es un problema de la ciudad. La raz\u00f3n por la que tenemos m\u00e1s l\u00edneas de servicio de plomo en esta ciudad que en cualquier otro lugar del pa\u00eds es porque hasta la d\u00e9cada de 1980, el C\u00f3digo de Chicago exig\u00eda que se usara plomo para las l\u00edneas de servicio. As\u00ed que la ciudad tiene que dar un paso al frente y decir: \"Escucha, hemos hecho esto mal, tenemos que arreglar esto\". No me puede decir que no hay correlaci\u00f3n entre las l\u00edneas de servicio contaminadas de plomo aqu\u00ed y la violencia en la ciudad, cuando se trata de algunos de los problemas de salud mental que existen. Creo que est\u00e1 claro, y tenemos que ser capaces de resolverlo.\u00bfApoya Tratamiento No Trauma? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo encaja eso con las ideas y pol\u00edticas que tiene sobre la salud mental y la seguridad?S\u00ed. Y cuando constru\u00ed mi plan de salud mental, hace unos tres meses, es muy similar al trabajo que Tratamiento [No] Trauma ha tratado de presentar.\u00bfQu\u00e9 es diferente en el tuyo en comparaci\u00f3n con la ordenanza Tratamiento No Trauma original?Mi plan es un poco m\u00e1s robusto. Hablo m\u00e1s sobre las operaciones reales de las instalaciones de salud mental. Pero mi plan se inspir\u00f3 en el trabajo de Tratamiento [No] Trauma.La alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot prometi\u00f3 una junta escolar electa. Y sabemos c\u00f3mo result\u00f3 eso. \u00bfApoyar\u00e1 una junta escolar electa si es elegido alcalde?Estoy tratando de decir esto de una manera m\u00e1s humilde. Cuando la alcaldesa se retracto de su promesa de darle a la gente de Chicago una junta escolar electa, lo mismo que tienen todos los dem\u00e1s distritos escolares de este estado, fue mi liderazgo en Springfield el que la super\u00f3, que nos llev\u00f3 all\u00ed. Y entonces, no solo apoyo a la junta escolar electa, sino que estoy muy orgulloso del hecho de que pude ayudar a que ese proyecto de ley llegara a la meta. Estoy muy orgulloso del hecho de que el proyecto de ley de la junta escolar electa que presentamos un par de meses despu\u00e9s fue el proyecto de ley que escrib\u00ed y que aprob\u00e9, que tambi\u00e9n impuso una moratoria sobre el cierre de escuelas en Chicago hasta despu\u00e9s de la elecci\u00f3n. La junta escolar est\u00e1 completamente lista. Porque sabemos lo que han hecho los cierres de escuelas en su comunidad y parec\u00eda que el alcalde estaba buscando hacer m\u00e1s de ellos.Mi madre pas\u00f3 35 a\u00f1os como maestra en las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago. Mi hermana peque\u00f1a es maestra de una escuela p\u00fablica de Chicago en el lado sur de Chicago. Mi hermana mayor es directora de una Escuela P\u00fablica de Chicago en Austin ahora mismo en el West Side. Esto es s\u00faper importante para m\u00ed. Y tenemos que asegurarnos de hacerlo bien.El pr\u00f3ximo alcalde puede elegir la mitad de esa junta porque la junta h\u00edbrida comienza en el 2024. Pero creo que no solo debemos tener un alcalde que adopte la forma en que funciona esta junta, sino que est\u00e9 dispuesto a trabajar con esta junta. Una cosa que hemos visto con este alcalde es la falta de voluntad para trabajar con personas que son parte interesadas, ya sea el Concejo Municipal o grupos comunitarios, y eso es un problema. La raz\u00f3n por la que es un problema realmente grande en los pr\u00f3ximos cuatro a\u00f1os es porque tenemos una junta escolar de 21 miembros en camino. Tenemos 66 miembros de los consejos de distrito de la polic\u00eda. No veo a este alcalde trabajando con ninguno de esos grupos. Entonces, la \u00fanica forma apropiada para que la ciudad avance es tener un alcalde que pueda trabajar con todas esas entidades de manera respetuosa. Y he demostrado que puedo hacer eso.Cuando piensa en qui\u00e9nes deber\u00edan formar parte de esta junta, \u00bfqu\u00e9 tipo de personas seleccionar\u00eda para ella, en caso de ser elegido alcalde? Cu\u00e9ntenos un poco sobre lo que pasa por su mente en t\u00e9rminos de elegir personas para la junta.Personas que se han comprometido con nuestros j\u00f3venes. Las personas que, ya sean miembros de LSC de la comunidad, o personas que han trabajado en la educaci\u00f3n y en torno a ella, creo que eso es importante. Personas que son padres de estudiantes de CPS. Personas que tienen un inter\u00e9s creado en este distrito. Personas que tienen algo de experiencia en c\u00f3mo hacemos crecer la inscripci\u00f3n. Creo que CPS ha perdido ni\u00f1es durante los \u00faltimos 11 a\u00f1os. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hacemos para que este sea un sistema escolar de primer nivel? \u00bfC\u00f3mo damos a nuestros j\u00f3venes los recursos que necesitan? Entonces, las personas que piensan as\u00ed y que no est\u00e1n preocupadas por los t\u00edtulos, pero que realmente quieren trabajar y obtener algunos resultados.Durante d\u00e9cadas, el alcalde en ejercicio de Chicago ha estado en desacuerdo con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago y con muchos de los maestros, el personal e incluso los estudiantes de base que se quejan de la falta de recursos y las malas condiciones dentro de las escuelas. Todos hemos estado dentro de las escuelas de CPS, especialmente en los vecindarios Negros, y es necesario que haya alguna mejor\u00eda all\u00ed. \u00bfCu\u00e1l cree que es la desconexi\u00f3n?Sabes, no puedo decirte que lo s\u00e9. Pero s\u00ed s\u00e9 que la desconexi\u00f3n ha hecho que sea extremadamente dif\u00edcil para nuestros j\u00f3venes aprender, tener \u00e9xito y crecer. Y los estamos preparando para el fracaso. Y eso es problem\u00e1tico.Lo que he dicho es que el contrato del sindicato de maestros se acerca el 30 de junio de 2024. Lo que he prometido es que no esperar\u00e9 hasta el 15 de junio para negociar el nuevo contrato. Lo har\u00e9 el primer d\u00eda. Y no lo har\u00e9 desde detr\u00e1s del podio, ni por nota de prensa ni por tuit. Pero negociar\u00e9 de buena fe. Y lo har\u00e9 yo mismo, si es necesario, desde la mesa de mi cocina. Porque necesitamos cierta estabilidad en esta conversaci\u00f3n entre el ayuntamiento, CPS y el sindicato de maestros, y no ha existido. Esto es muy personal para m\u00ed.Cuando me convierta en el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago, ser\u00e9 el primer alcalde graduado de CPS desde Harold Washington. Eso es un gran problema para m\u00ed. \u00bfPreguntaste antes c\u00f3mo mi educaci\u00f3n contextualiza mi pol\u00edtica? Esto es lo que soy. Y estoy cansado de que CPS sea el hazmerre\u00edr. Estoy cansado de que no brindemos lo que nuestros j\u00f3venes necesitan. Una ni\u00f1a peque\u00f1a en Austin o un ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o en Bronzeville no solo compiten contra un ni\u00f1e de Evanston o Oak Park, o un ni\u00f1e de Wisconsin o Indiana. Est\u00e1n compitiendo contra ni\u00f1es de todo el mundo. Esta es una econom\u00eda global en la que hemos ingresado y no hemos puesto a nuestros j\u00f3venes en esta ciudad en una posici\u00f3n para capitalizar eso. Tenemos que.\u00bfTiene alguna pol\u00edtica en la cual esta trabajando o redactando sobre CPS y c\u00f3mo mejorar las escuelas en particular cuando hablamos de escuelas en vecindarios Negros y Latine?Creo que probablemente sea la \u00fanica persona en esta contienda que present\u00f3 un plan de educaci\u00f3n real en septiembre. Nos paramos frente a una escuela cerrada en East Garfield Park. El alcalde Emanuel los hab\u00eda cerrado y nos unimos a la comunidad para presentar nuestro plan. Dwayne Truss, quien era un miembro de la junta escolar que el alcalde Lightfoot expuls\u00f3 porque no hizo lo que ella quer\u00eda que hiciera, estuvo con nosotros para respaldar nuestro plan educativo y hablar sobre lo importante que era que pudi\u00e9ramos mejorar a CPS, para ponerlo en marcha.Creo que una de las piezas m\u00e1s importantes que ser\u00e1 \u00fatil a medida que avanzamos es que debemos tener los recursos de Springfield para que esto suceda. He luchado por m\u00e1s fondos para las escuelas en Springfield desde que llegu\u00e9 all\u00ed. Y hemos podido aumentar el presupuesto cada a\u00f1o.El primer d\u00eda, tenemos que tener un alcalde que pueda entrar en la I-55 e ir al Capitolio y hacer que las cosas sucedan. Nadie en esta carrera puede tener el impacto que se necesita en Springfield para traer recursos a nuestras escuelas como yo puedo.\u00bfCon qui\u00e9n tiene que hablar en Springfield para hacer eso?Bueno, el presidente de la C\u00e1mara, el presidente del Senado y el gobernador. Esas son las personas que realmente est\u00e1n a cargo all\u00ed. Y obviamente, he tenido una gran relaci\u00f3n con los tres. Trabajo muy bien con los tres. He logrado que se apruebe una legislaci\u00f3n monumental all\u00ed.Hist\u00f3ricamente, hemos visto grandes desarrollos que han desplazado y borrado a comunidades Negras en Chicago, por ejemplo, vimos que sucedi\u00f3 con la construcci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Illinois en el West Side y el distrito m\u00e9dico circundante. Lo hemos visto con la construcci\u00f3n de la Autopista 290 en el West Side. \u00bfC\u00f3mo crear\u00eda pol\u00edticas para apoyar a los residentes Negros a quienes algunos de los nuevos desarrollos, como el Centro Presidencial Obama o el casino que llegar\u00e1 a Cabrini Green, est\u00e1n pagando por los precios?He sido un gran defensor de asegurarme de que tengamos acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios que hayamos convertido en ley, cosas que protejan a las comunidades. Anteriormente trabaj\u00e9 para los Cachorros de Chicago. Y cuando trabaj\u00e9 para esa organizaci\u00f3n, me qued\u00e9 impresionado cuando me di cuenta por primera vez de que literalmente existe una ordenanza municipal para proteger a la comunidad de Lakeview del equipo de los Cachorros. Se llamaba Ordenanza de Protecci\u00f3n de Vecindarios. Y requiere que el club de b\u00e9isbol brinde una cierta cantidad de seguridad y limpieza de basura y dinero caritativo a las organizaciones en el \u00e1rea. Hay muchas cosas que pueden suceder cuando una comunidad se pone de pie. Pero creo que los funcionarios deben poder construir esas protecciones para las comunidades y no hemos visto eso.He apoyado a las personas que pidieron el acuerdo de beneficios comunitarios para Woodlawn y Washington Park, alrededor del Centro Presidencial Obama. No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 va a pasar en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os con el sitio de US Steel en el lado sureste de Chicago, en una comunidad que ha sido una zona de sacrificio por da\u00f1os industriales y fallas ambientales. Y entonces tenemos que empezar a pensar en c\u00f3mo protegemos a esa gente.Tenemos que asegurarnos de que estamos protegiendo a estas comunidades. Lo he hecho en mi papel como representante estatal. Creo que, como alcalde, creo que tambi\u00e9n tenemos que institucionalizar la protecci\u00f3n de estas comunidades de estos grandes desarrollos. Y por eso no he sido t\u00edmido a la hora de rechazar algunos de estos desarrollos m\u00e1s grandes. De hecho, hay un desarrollo o un desarrollo propuesto en mi distrito de representaci\u00f3n estatal, llamado One Central, que se supone que se construir\u00e1 al otro lado de la calle de Soldier Field. Y si miras la cobertura de noticias sobre eso, he sido la \u00fanica persona que retrocedi\u00f3 para asegurarme de que la comunidad tenga voz en lo que sucede en ese espacio. Y eso es esto, mi marca registrada. Me lo tomo muy en serio.\u00bfC\u00f3mo le hace para cumplir algo as\u00ed? Incluso con el CBA que est\u00e1 en Woodlawn alrededor de la Biblioteca Obama en este momento, la gente todav\u00eda sigue siendo desplazada por costo que sigue subiendo.Yo que creo que el Departamento de Vivienda tiene que ser m\u00e1s agresivo y asegurarse de que no estamos dejando que el mercado fluct\u00fae tanto que estamos poniendo a la gente en la posicion que ya no puede pagar su renta o comprar una casa porque subio mucho de precio.Vivo en Bronzeville. Hay una casa al otro lado de la calle que cuesta un poco m\u00e1s de $ 700,000, lo que para m\u00ed es una estupidez. No puedo creer eso. Pero estamos viendo eso. Entonces, cuando hablamos de la estabilidad de la renta, cuando hablamos de asegurarnos de que a las personas no se les subestime el precio, de que las personas no gasten m\u00e1s del 30 % de sus ingresos en el lugar donde viven, creo que el departamento de vivienda de la ciudad tiene mucho que puede hacer. Tenemos que ser m\u00e1s inteligentes sobre la forma en que funciona la zonificaci\u00f3n espec\u00edficamente en comunidades que est\u00e1n a la orilla de la gentrificaci\u00f3n. Tenemos que asegurarnos de no desplazar a la gente. Hay algunas cosas que creo que se pueden hacer a trav\u00e9s del c\u00f3digo de zonificaci\u00f3n para que eso tambi\u00e9n sea efectivo.Muchos de los donantes de su campa\u00f1a provienen de grandes empresas y residen fuera de Chicago. \u00bfC\u00f3mo describir\u00eda a algunas de las personas y grupos que lo han respaldado? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo es usted responsable ante ellos? \u00bfHa tenido que hacerles alguna promesa?Yo me enorgullezco como representante estatal, y ahora como candidato a la alcald\u00eda, para ser claro, transparente y responsable ante las personas que me enviaron a esta posici\u00f3n. Y eso ha quedado muy claro en mi historial de votaciones. Eso ha sido muy claro al rechazar el poder y la autoridad cuando no est\u00e1 haciendo lo correcto para las comunidades a las que sirvo. Y debo decirles que en esta campa\u00f1a para la alcald\u00eda hemos tenido m\u00e1s donantes individuales de base que cualquier otra persona en esta contienda, incluido el alcalde. As\u00ed que estos son habitantes de Chicago de toda la ciudad que quieren ver un cambio, que est\u00e1n rogando por un nuevo liderazgo. Y estamos muy entusiasmados con eso.\u00a0Veremos algunos respaldos, creo que tan pronto como esta semana, en realidad, en ciertos funcionarios electos que respaldar\u00e1n nuestra campa\u00f1a, y luego tambi\u00e9n en otros grupos a medida que avanzan en su proceso. Pero yo creo que mi trayectoria en la Asamblea General, y la gente que me ha apoyado en este espacio, he sido muy claro, verdad. As\u00ed que siempre obtuve el respaldo y el apoyo de personas como el Sierra Club, y personas como el Consejo Ambiental de Illinois, as\u00ed como grupos de base en el terreno, como el Centro de Trabajadores por la Justicia Racial. Y en ese tipo de grupos con los que he podido trabajar para hacer las cosas.Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?Esa es una gran pregunta. Y es lamentable que tengas que preguntar eso. Hemos visto a personas cooptar movimientos y lenguaje y decir ciertas cosas, y luego simplemente llegar al cargo y hacer algo completamente diferente.\u00a0Como comenc\u00e9 esta conversaci\u00f3n, cuando digo hijo de Chicago, de aqu\u00ed, nacido aqu\u00ed, criado aqu\u00ed, morir\u00e9 aqu\u00ed. Este es mi hogar. Y no me voy a ninguna parte. Entonces, para m\u00ed, es importante rendir cuentas, no solo a las personas que represento, sino que estos son mis amigos, estos son mis vecinos. Estas son personas que son parte de mi pueblo en mi comunidad. Y no puedo decir una cosa hoy, y luego pasar a otra, y luego regresar y decir, denme la bienvenida con los brazos abiertos. Simplemente no es como yo opero.\u00a0As\u00ed que estar\u00e9 muy abierto y dispuesto a regresar y comunicarme con la gente. \u00bfEstoy haciendo lo que dije que har\u00eda? \u00bfEstoy manteniendo las promesas que hice cuando te ped\u00ed este trabajo? Esta es una entrevista de trabajo. Y es agresivo. Pero para m\u00ed es muy importante que la gente sepa claramente qui\u00e9n soy."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Kam Buckner",
  "text": "Kam Buckner wants to remind everyone that he is a son of Chicago. His family has roots in Mississippi; they moved to Chicago during the second Great Migration after the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in nearby Money, Mississippi. Buckner, 37, is a graduate of Chicago Public Schools, and boasts being the only candidate in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race who can claim that honor \u2014 he went to Clissold Elementary School in Beverly and then Morgan Park High School.As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, on Jan. 2 Buckner invited The TRiiBE to his campaign office inside the shopping center off 55th and Wentworth Avenue in Washington Park. He noted that the area was hit badly during the 2020 summer uprisings.\u201cIn May 2020, after the death of George Floyd and when social unrest began to gin up around the country, specifically here in Chicago, we know that many of the shopping centers around the city were boarded up,\u201d Buckner said, directing his attention to the mural painted on the piece of plywood behind him inside the office. \u201cBut then we also saw an influx of many Chicago artists being able to use the plywood as an expressive way to tell their stories as well. It was some beautiful artwork around the city.\u201dDuring the interview, Buckner didn\u2019t linger on the fact that his father was a longtime Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Department officer, and that he has an uncle who was a sworn CPD officer and another uncle who was a CPD civilian employee. Instead, he highlighted his work as a state representative to bring the SAFE-T Act and Chicago\u2019s first-ever elected school board to fruition. We also asked him about his plans for policing and public safety should he become mayor.\u00a0Throughout our interview, he was adamant about not increasing CPD\u2019s budget if elected. However, he did talk about filling existing vacancies within CPD and finding resources to put more detectives on the streets.Read our full interview with Buckner below, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: How does your environment growing up shape your politics and who you are and your outlook on life today?Kam Buckner: I talk a lot in this campaign about being a son of Chicago. And to me, that's a big deal, right? We could talk about where you go to college and went to law school and all that fun stuff. That's resume-based stuff. But literally being a person who grew up here, who is a Chicago Public School graduate, a person who played in Chicago parks and went to summer camp in Chicago parks and was an early and young utilizer of Chicago Public Library. Chicago really is in my DNA. It\u2019s at the core of who I am.And when I talk about the reason I'm running for mayor, when I talk about the space that I find myself in today, it really is based on what I feel this city has been able to give me and my family. My mother moved here from Mississippi in 1955. She actually moved here in September of 1955. And the reason that she came here was that in August of 1955, Emmett Till was murdered in the town that was next door to hers. And so when my grandmother and my grandfather heard about this little Black boy from Chicago, who came down to Mississippi and was mutilated, was lynched, was tortured for no other reason than the color of his skin, honestly, they had had enough, right. My mother grew up seeing lynchings. She grew up dealing with the things that were central to Jim Crow. But that was the final straw for my grandparents. And so they packed the girls up and made the trek to Chicago for safety and for opportunity. And so I always remind myself that that's how I got here, because it's how my family got here.You pled guilty to a second DUI earlier this year, and said that it taught you a lesson. What lesson did you learn from the second one? And what does it say about you as a role model for young Black Chicagoans?I've been very open and transparent about my past mistakes and my missteps. I've taken responsibility and accountability for them. I've had the conversations about this publicly with my constituents, with my God and my spiritual team and my family. And in the four years that have occurred since the second incident happened, the people of the 26th District have reelected me or have voted for me in four different elections since then.The Speaker of the House has asked me twice to be a part of his leadership team. The Black Caucus has asked me to chair them, which I did through some very tough times in 2020. And I'm ending my chairmanship in 10 days here. And so I think it's very clear that I've become a better person since then.A lot has happened personally for me since then; got married. I\u2019m a father now. And so I think that what I want to convey to young, especially young Black Chicagoans is that mistakes and missteps don\u2019t have to be your demise, right? We all make mistakes, and we\u2019re fortunate [to] learn from them. And we\u2019re able to impart wisdom on other folks and show people that you may be down but you\u2019re not out.You grew up with a very law enforcement-heavy family. You've said that you support both GoodKid MadCity's Peace Book proposal, and an increase in the size of\u00a0 the police force. What parts of the Peace Book do you support? And how does that work with your plan to increase the police force?My dad was actually [in] Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Department. My uncles were CPD, both sworn officers and civilian employees as well. And so not only do I support the Peace Book, but I actually worked with GoodKids MadCity to write the state counterpart to that: the Peace Act. It basically takes the work that is in the Peace Book ordinance and expands it to every single police department in the state.When I talk about filling vacancies, I don\u2019t talk about increasing the size of CPD. I talk about vacancies that already exist, but I also talk about civilianization of many functions. I also talk about, not a call-responder model for mental health calls like currently exists, but a model where cops are not showing up at all \u2014 where it\u2019s only a trained mental health professional. I think that's all that's important to be able to bring the city forward.Increasing the size of the police department is not the recipe for this. What I often talk about is two things. I see public security and I see public safety. I think public security is law enforcement. I think law enforcement has to exist for when untoward things happen, and we need a response to that. Law enforcement is responsive.I unfortunately have seen numerous times in my family where people have been victimized. My uncle who I was talking about earlier, who's a CPD civilian employee, he worked in the equipment space down at the headquarters on 35th Street. And in 2016, was shot to death, taking groceries out of his car in the Morgan Park neighborhood where I grew up at. And I remember the process of going through the process with the detectives on finding who did it. It happened to be a young man\u2014I think he was 16 at the time, shooting across the street at another young man and my uncle errantly got hit. But these stories are too real. And they're everyday stories in the city. And so once again, I think we need to have an apparatus that is able to respond when these things happen. But also, we got to be preventative and proactive and give people what they need to be safe and to feel safe.When you say you supported GoodKids MadCity and like the drafting of the Peace Book, will you implement the Peace Book?Absolutely. Two of the things that should be the first few bullet points in my public safety plan. The Peace Book ordinance, I will implement it. I will work on getting that done day one, and the Anjanette Young ordinance as well.Organizers have called for more mental health and preventative measures to counteract some of the violence that we see. So we've had that conversation a lot of times. Leaders have had this conversation a lot of times, but then when people get in office, we don't see that. We still see the police budget increase. There are calls to have more police out on the street. Do you have any policies that you are thinking about crafting or have already crafted that really show what these two institutions could look like; this idea of preventative measures and policing? When you mentioned police responding to certain crimes, what crimes? How does that work?I think you're right. I think we, especially with this current mayor, I\u2019ll just call it what it is. We were sold a bill of goods. And once she was sworn in, almost immediately she backpedaled on so many things that many of us were excited about in the city. And it's disappointing, to say the least. But as I've said many times on this campaign trail, politicians make promises, the leaders keep them, which this mayor has failed to do. And so we got to hold her accountable for that.\u00a0In my public safety plan, which is called Safer 77, being a nod to the 77 communities in Chicago, I talk a lot about making sure that CPD can not be laser-focused on petty crimes, I mean crimes that are smaller and nonviolent. We've got a 20% clearance rate on homicides. No matter where you fall on this conversation, there's nobody who tells me that they're okay with an 80% chance of killing somebody in Chicago and never having to pay for it. That's problematic.\u00a0So, in my plan, I talk a lot about providing resources to put more detectives in the streets. These are not somebody that's pulling you over for an expired tag and then busting you for having some weed in your car.When you say more detectives in the streets, it does sound like more policing.Yes. No, absolutely. When I sit down with families in my state rep district, specifically families who have lost young people, they want more detectives. Once again, detectives aren\u2019t cops who \u2018gon lock folks up. They\u2019re not banging on your door. They\u2019re solving crimes and solving murders specifically.\u00a0Two Labor Days ago, there was a [4-year-old boy] named [Mychael] \u201cMJ\u201d Moultry Jr. and he was killed in my district, in fact, killed across the street from a park that\u2019s named after Emmett Till\u2019s mother. Right. And I talked to his parents a lot.I talked to them over this holiday break, just to check in on them because I know it was tough for them. And when I talk to people like that, and they have no answers on their son\u2019s death, no answers. The mayor came out and did some dog-and-pony press conference. But then the calls from CPD stopped. And it\u2019s because they said they don\u2019t have the manpower to do it. That\u2019s a huge failure to me.I don't want to increase the police state. I don't think that we should be flooding our streets with more officers to police in an unconstitutional way. I think we got some real issues. You read the consent decree, you'll see that we've got a long way to go. But what I do think is that we need to start bringing some closure and some solace to the families in the city who have been victims of violence, specifically, like I said, for young people. If I told you how much time I spent talking to parents who have lost their children, it's a really damning indictment on where we have gone as a society.Your language gives law and order. On first impression, it reads like you\u2019re a pro-cop candidate. And for our audience who may be trying to decide who is the most progressive candidate, I think they need a little bit more information about what your investment in policing is going to be. You mentioned detectives. Is there anything else? When it comes to the police budget, can you get specific about moving numbers around?For me, when I talk about being able to provide both safety and justice, it is making sure that the CPD budget isn\u2019t once again putting more officers in the street to occupy our communities. That is not the way to go. That\u2019s not how we make people safer.What I've also said is that we can't sufficiently talk about the violence that's happening in our communities until we sufficiently talk about the violence that has happened to our communities. I mean benign neglect. I mean removing resources. I mean there's the shuttering of 50-plus schools. I think [about] the criminalization of being Black. We've seen that in Chicago for far too long. So we got to be able to deal with those issues.I\u2019ve talked to specifically young Black men in this city who have wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement. And that is something that they want to do, because they feel like they can give back to their community that way. But these guys, because either they\u2019re on a gang database or because they\u2019ve had a marijuana charge \u2014 which is legal now \u2014 at some point in their lives, have been told that they can\u2019t serve their community through that way. That\u2019s problematic. So I talked about that, in my plan too, removing some of those barriers that have made the police department more racist and more monolithic in a way that has not been helpful to our communities. So that for sure was a big deal to me.\u00a0But I also talk about CPD currently using this co-responder model now, where it\u2019s a pilot, but they\u2019re sending a mental health professional and a cop out when someone has a mental health call. To me, that\u2019s half baked, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do. Because if you come to the scene where I am, and I\u2019m having a mental health episode, I mean, I\u2019m not gonna see the guy with the clipboard. I\u2019ma see the dude with the gun and the badge.When I think about Quintonio LeGrier who was killed the day after Christmas in 2015. The young man called CPD on himself. He made a number of calls saying he was not feeling right. He was having a mental health episode. And he wanted help. And they sent two officers, with their weapons drawn, to go help a man who said that he was having an issue and [they] ended up killing him. They shot through the building next door and killed Bettie Jones, his next door neighbor, who was on her couch watching TV. There's no way you can make me think that a co-responder model stops that, but you know what stops that? If someone without a gun shows up. And so when I talk about repositioning the budget, I haven\u2019t gotten to really deep specifics, because as I said earlier, CPD lies about what their budget looks like. You got to get under the hood there, once you\u2019re in office, to see where those things kind of line up. But I truly believe that there has to be money there for us to, once again, [have] mental health professionals, social workers, civilianization. And I talk a lot about civilianization of the police force. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t think that you need a person with a gun and a badge to do everything, and we got young people in Chicago who don\u2019t want to be a cop but want to be in the law enforcement public-safety space. Why are there not jobs within the department for them?So it\u2019s not enough just to change policing in Chicago, we got to change Chicago, and that has to start with having leadership in city hall that is able to make the tough decisions on what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not increasing CPD\u2019s budget while clearance rates are still going down. It\u2019s not more money in the spaces that have been problematic given CPD\u2019s relationship with the community.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s pro-cop at all. Everything I\u2019ve tried to convey is really pro-Chicago. I\u2019ve said it and I\u2019ll say it again: Communities in Chicago know what they need to be safe. We need to listen to people. That\u2019s not currently happening. And I\u2019ve made that a pillar of the work that I want to do as mayor.CPD gets a lot of the city budget. With some of the ideas that you have in mind, as you just talked about with safety, how do you fund things like that? Where does the funding come from?When you talk about the civilianization of the police force, I think there are certain things that aren\u2019t going to be housed within the CPD budget. So I think you move some of those numbers around. I think there's ways to move some of what\u2019s already in CPD\u2019s budget. Once again, CPD has not been very forthcoming with where they're putting all their dollars. But I will be willing to bet, like, blind items for militarization and equipment, like, they have to go. I'm sure it's there. That's gotta go. So we can take that and put a social worker or mental health professional on the rolls. Let's do that.\u00a0I think some of that the budgetary stuff is a split between CPD and obviously the Chicago Department of Public Health, as well. The money's there.What also is true is that we've missed out on a lot of state and federal dollars, because we have not wanted to have a mental health infrastructure in this city. There are cities around the country \u2014 Austin, Texas, Philadelphia \u2014 who are getting big money from the federal government, because they have a plan. And we don't, so we're missing out on that, and that will changeHow do you feel about the SAFE-T Act? Is it something that you support?I helped write it. worked very hard to get it across the finish line. I've worked very hard over the last few months to defend it in public, especially from lies and outright attacks on just the face of it. And I'll tell you this, I know that it\u2019s monumental. And other folks around this country are watching to see what happens with it. And I'll continue to fight for it in Springfield and anywhere else that I can. We took, I think, courageous steps to dismantle a system that treats you better if you are guilty and you have the means than it does if you are innocent and you don\u2019t have the means. So when you dismantle and you attack systems like that, they will attack you back, which is what we\u2019re seeing today with the implementation and the rollout of the SAFE-T Act. But I\u2019m confident that it will begin to take form and people will see that we become a safer society when we\u2019re not over-policing, when there\u2019s accountability, when there\u2019s transparency, and when there\u2019s some real ways to measure success.Is there a correlation between mental health and violence in Chicago? And if so, how are you thinking about this correlation as you draft ideas around policies regarding safety and mental health?I think there are huge correlations. Honestly, I'll tell you, I think that we had a mental health issue in the city before the pandemic but I think it's only getting worse in the last two, almost three years, which is crazy. We got to be real about the perpetual trauma that we have put our communities through, specifically our young people.I was talking to some young people at a school in my district, Doolittle on 35th Street. And these young people not only had two or three classmates who were deceased, been shot and killed over the last few years, but as one young man was telling me about all the shootings that he saw over the last year, and he\u2019s keeping it inside, and there\u2019s nobody that you can talk to. In the school, there\u2019s nobody he can talk to in the space that can help him work through that trauma. We are putting this PTSD on our young people who don\u2019t have a way to deal with it.In my mental health plan,I call for reopening 20 mental health facilities in the city and making a number of those 24-hour facilities so people can come in throughout the day. Also, putting together mobile units so that folks can seek help no matter where they are on the street. And I think that all that matters. We're going to make sure we do that. I\u2019ve talked about putting mental health professionals in all of our Chicago schools. I think that's extremely important.And one thing that we don't talk enough about is the lead pipe removal. We know that our young people are being poisoned. And the city has said, \u201cWell listen, if you got lead pipes, you gotta figure it out yourself.\u201d The truth of the matter is, this is a city problem. The reason that we have more lead service lines in this city than anywhere else in the country is because up until the 1980s, the Chicago Code mandated that you use lead for service lines. So the city has to step up and say, \u201cListen, we've done this wrong, we gotta fix this.\u201d You can't tell me that there's no correlation between the lead service lines here and the violence in the city, when it comes to some of the mental health issues that exist. I think it's clear, and we got to be able to work through it.Do you support Treatment Not Trauma? And if so, how does that fit in with the ideas and policies you have around mental health and safety?Yes, I do. And when I built my mental health plan, about three months ago, it\u2019s very similar to the work that Treatment [Not] Trauma has tried to put forward.What\u2019s different in yours compared to the original Treatment Not Trauma?My plan is a little bit more robust. I talk more about actual operations of the mental health facilities. But my plan was inspired by the Treatment [Not] Trauma work, for sure.Mayor Lori Lightfoot promised an elected school board. And we know how that turned out. Will you support an elected school board if elected mayor?I\u2019m trying to say this in a more humble way. When the mayor backflips on her promise to give the people of Chicago an elected school board, the same thing that every other school district in this state has,it was my leadership in Springfield that got it over the top,that took us there. And so not only do I support the elected school board, I'm super proud of the fact that I was able to help get that bill across the finish line. I'm super proud of the fact that the elected school board trailer bill that we ran a couple of months after that was the bill that I wrote, and that I carried, which also put a moratorium on school closings in Chicago until after the elected school board is fully set. Because we know what school closings have done in their community and it appeared that the mayor was looking to do more of them.My mother spent 35 years as a Chicago Public School teacher. My little sister is a Chicago Public School teacher on the South Side of Chicago. My older sister is a Chicago Public School principal in Austin right now on the West Side. This is super important to me. And we\u2019ve got to make sure we get this right.The next mayor gets to pick half of that board because the hybrid starts in 2024. But I think not only do we have to have a mayor who embraces the way that this board works but is willing to work with this board. One thing we've seen with this mayor is an unwillingness to work with folks who are stakeholders, whether it's the City Council or community groups, and that's a problem. The reason it\u2019s a real big problem coming into this next four years is because we have a 21-member school board coming. We got 66 members of the police district councils. I don't see this mayor working with any of those groups. And so the only appropriate way for the city to move forward is to have a mayor that's able to work with all of those entities in a respectful way. And I\u2019ve proven I can do that.When you think about who should make up this board, what type of people would you select for it, if elected mayor? Tell me a little bit about what goes through your mind in terms of picking people for the board.Folks who have been committed to our young people. People who, whether they're community LSC members, or whether they are folks who have done work in and around education, I think that's important. Folks who are parents of CPS students. Folks who have a vested interest in this district. People who have some experience in how do we grow enrollment. CPS has, I think, lost kids for the last 11 years. What do we do to make this a top-notch school system? How do we give our young people the resources they need? So people who are thinking like that, and who are not concerned with titles, but really want to work and get some results.For decades, the sitting mayor of Chicago has been at odds with the Chicago Teachers Union, and many of the rank-and-file teachers, staff, and even students who complain about the lack of resources and poor conditions within the school. We all have been inside of CPS schools, especially in Black neighborhoods, and there needs to be some improvement there. What do you think the disconnect is?You know, I can\u2019t tell you that I know. But I do know that the disconnect has made it extremely difficult for our young people to learn, to succeed, to grow. And we\u2019re setting them up for failure. And that\u2019s problematic.What I've said is that the teachers union contract is coming up June 30, 2024. What I've promised is that I won't wait until June 15 to negotiate the new contract. I'll do it on day one. And I will not do it from behind the podium, or by press release or by tweet. But I will negotiate in good faith. And I'll do it myself, if I have to, from my kitchen table. Because we need some stability in this conversation between city hall, CPS and the teachers union, and it hasn't existed. This is very personal to me.When I become the next mayor of Chicago, I will be the first mayor who\u2019s a CPS graduate since Harold Washington. That\u2019s a big deal to me. You asked earlier how my upbringing contextualizes my politics? This is who I am. And I\u2019m tired of CPS being a laughingstock. I\u2019m tired of us not providing what our young people need. A little girl in Austin or a little boy in Bronzeville is not just competing against a kid from Evanston or Oak Park, or a kid from Wisconsin or Indiana. They\u2019re competing against kids from across the world. This is a global economy that we\u2019ve entered into and we have not put our young people in this city in a position to capitalize off that. We have to.Do you have any policies as you're working on or drafting around CPS and how to improve it\u2014and particularly when we're talking about schools in Black and brown neighborhoods?I think I may probably be the only person in this race who presented an actual education plan in September. We stood in front of a shuttered school in East Garfield Park. They had been closed down by Mayor Emanuel and we stood with the community to present our plan. Dwayne Truss, who was a school board member who Mayor Lightfoot kicked out because he didn\u2019t do what she wanted him to do, stood with us to endorse our education plan and to talk about how important it was that we were able to fix CPS to get it going. I think one of the biggest pieces that is going to be helpful as we move things along is that we got to have the resources from Springfield to make it happen. I\u2019ve fought for more funding for schools in Springfield since I\u2019ve been there. And we\u2019ve been able to increase the budget every single year.On day one, we have to have a mayor who can get on I-55 and go on down to the Capitol and make things happen. No one in this race can have the impact that needs to happen in Springfield to bring resources back to our schools like I can.Who do you have to talk to in Springfield to do that?Well, the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the Governor. Those are the folks who are really in charge down there. And obviously, I've had a great relationship with all three of them. I work very well with all three of them. I've been able to get monumental legislation passed down there.Historically, we've watched big developments displace and erase Black communities in Chicago, for example, we saw it happening with the University of Illinois being built on the West Side and the surrounding Medical District. We've seen it with the building of the 290 Expressway on the West Side. How would you create policies to support Black residents who are being priced out by some of the new developments such as the Obama Presidential Center or the casino coming to Cabrini Green?I've been a huge proponent of making sure that we have community benefits agreements that we have put in law, things that protect communities. I formerly worked for the Chicago Cubs. And when I worked for that organization, I was blown away when I first realized that there is literally a city ordinance to protect the Lakeview community from the Cubs. It was called the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance. And it requires the ballclub to provide a certain amount of security and litter cleanup and charitable money to organizations in the area. There's a lot that can happen when a community stands up. But I think the officials have to be able to build those protections for communities and we haven't seen that.I\u2019ve stood with the folks who called for the community benefits agreement for Woodlawn and Washington Park, around the Obama Presidential Center. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next few years with the US Steel site down on the southeast side of Chicago, in a community that has been a sacrifice zone for industrial harm and environmental failure. And so we\u2019ve got to start thinking about how we protect those folks.We've got to make sure that we're protecting these communities. I've done it in my role as a state representative. I think, as mayor, I believe that we have to institutionalize the protection of these communities from these big developments as well. And so I've not been shy about pushing back on some of these larger developments. In fact, there's a development or a proposed development in my state rep district, called One Central, which is supposed to be built across the street from Soldier Field. And if you look at the news coverage on that, I've been the one person pushing back to make sure that community has a voice in what happens in that space. And so that's this, my trademark.I take that very seriously.How do you enforce something like that? Even with the CBA that's out there in Woodlawn around the Obama Library right now, people are still being priced out.So I think that the Department of Housing has to be more aggressive and make sure that we are not letting the market fluctuate away that we're pricing people out.\u00a0I live in Bronzeville. There\u2019s a house across the street from me that's just over $700,000, which to me is asinine. I can't believe that. But we're seeing that. And so when we talk about rent stability, when we talk about making sure that people are not being priced out, that people aren't spending more than 30% of their income on where they live, the city housing department, I think, has a lot that we can do. We\u2019ve got to be smarter about the way zoning works specifically in communities that are ripe for gentrification. We got to make sure that we're not displacing folks. There\u2019s some things I think you can do through the zoning code to make that effective as well.Many of your campaign donors are from big businesses and reside outside of Chicago. How would you describe some of the people and groups who have endorsed you? And how are you accountable to them? Have you had to make any promises to them?So I prided myself as a state representative, and now as a mayoral candidate, on being clear, transparent and accountable to the people who sent me to the seat. And that's been very clear by my voting record. That\u2019s been very clear by me pushing back against power and authority when it's not doing the right things for the communities that I serve. And I gotta tell you, in this mayoral campaign, we have had more grassroots single donors than anyone else in this race, including the mayor. So these are Chicagoans from all across the city who want to see change, who are begging for new leadership. And we're really excited about that.\u00a0We'll see some endorsements coming along I think as early as this week, actually, on certain elected officials who are going to be endorsing our campaign, and then other groups as they go through their process as well. But I think that my track record in the General Assembly, and the folks who have supported me in this space, I have been very clear, right. So I've always gotten the endorsement and the support of folks like the Sierra Club, and folks like the Illinois Environmental Council, as well as grassroots groups on the ground, like the Worker Center for Racial Justice. And in those types of groups I've been able to do work with to actually get stuff done.We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist and organizer language, and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to go back on those promises when they get into office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?That's a great question. And it's unfortunate you have to ask that. We have seen people co-opt movements and language and say certain things, and then just to get into office and do a completely different thing.\u00a0As I started off this conversation, when I say son of Chicago, from here, born here, raised here, will die here. This is home. And I'm not going anywhere. And so to me, it's important to be accountable, not just to the people that I represent, but these are my friends, these are my neighbors. These are people who are part of my village in my community. And I can't say one thing today, and then go into something else, and then come back and say, welcome me back with open arms. It's just not how I operate.\u00a0And so I'll be very open and amenable to coming back and checking in with the people. Am I doing what I said I would do? Am I keeping the promises that I've made when I asked you for this job? This is a job interview. And it's an aggressive one. But for me, it's very important that people can clearly know who I am."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "2023 Chicago mayoral candidate Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda endorsed Samie Martinez, a challenger to incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18. The endorsement puts Garc\u00eda in bed with allies of former Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s fiercest enemies, including former 33rd Ward Ald. Dick Mell. Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

That claim is false. According to the\u00a0FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics, about 29 percent of people arrested for violent crimes, property crimes, or drug-related crimes are Black.\u00a0Abbasi told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0that he did not remember writing the \u201c13/50\u201d group chat, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t remember what I tweeted two days ago,\u201d but admitted that he could not rule it out. He confirmed that he wrote all of the others.\u00a0On January 6, Abbasi\u00a0retweeted a photoshopped picture\u00a0another user posted of him wearing Ku Klux Klan regalia and sitting next to Kanye West. He said he retweets \u201cevery photoshop people make of me\u201d and that doing so is \u201can exercise in absurdity.\u201dIn another group chat message, Abbasi wrote, \u201cNow that I\u2019m in a relationship with a 36-year-old woman it gives me leeway to say that child porn sentences are way too long, like anything more than a year for downloading anything is evil.\u201d He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the message was meant as a joke poking fun at Libertarians.He reiterated several times during the interview that the message about a client who \u201ctook care of\u201d him with \u201cPolish girls\u201d who may have been \u201ctrafficked\u201d was entirely fictional and meant as a joke.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get an idea that sounds funny, and I\u2019ll post it,\u201d Abbasi said. He said that in the group chats he \u201cliked to play the villain, and make up insane things to stir shit up.\u201d He compared himself to Nick Adams, a conservative commentator who served as a surrogate for Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign and has repeated the false claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen.\u201d Abbasi added that he thinks Trump is \u201cthe funniest man alive.\u201dAsked about his politics, he said he was anti-war and believes everyone deserves health care. He said that police district councils have to determine \u201chow we\u2019re going to ameliorate the rise in crime, but it has to be done constitutionally and equitably.\u201dHe said he had \u201cno idea who 99 percent\u201d of his 24,000 Twitter followers are and that he believes they have a range of political views. The engagements he gets on social media fill a desire for celebrity that has helped him successfully lose weight, he added. His current \u201cbit\u201d on Twitter is posing as an \u201cAlpha male\u201d who is also a \u201ccloseted homosexual.\u201d\u00a0\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Abbasi\u2019s Twitter profile links to his legal practice, in which he files election paperwork and ballot petition challenges for political candidates. He said he will work for just about anyone, but that in police district council races he exclusively worked for the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). Earlier this week, WBEZ reported\u00a0that the FOP paid Abbasi $10,000.In December 2022, Abbasi filed petition challenges against progressive candidates who were running together as slates for police district councils. On January 13, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners ruled in favor of the progressives and kept them on the ballot.Abbasi said that the FOP \u201cneeded an election attorney. We came to an agreement.\u201d He added that he has worked for Democrats and Republicans in the past, and \u201cthe focus is doing the job for the client.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care about his clients\u2019 political ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily ideal, [but] for a lot of candidates I\u2019m not even sure of their platform.\u201d\u00a0A candidate for police district council in the 25th District, Abbasi said he was considering running, and that the FOP gave him a \u201cgreen light\u201d because they were not running any other candidates in that district. Had the FOP not consented to him running, he said he may not have.Abbasi also put his own contact information on election filings he submitted for six other candidates. He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the FOP referred them to him. Those candidates are:Abbasi also defended \u201cProco\u201d Joe Moreno, a former alderperson who is running for City Council in the First Ward, against a\u00a0petition challenge by two residents, and was the attorney for a petition challenge against one of Moreno\u2019s opponents, Sam Royko. The CEBC ultimately kept both candidates on the ballot.\u00a0Update 1/19/23:\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader,\u00a0Moreno said, \u201cI had no knowledge of this behavior. I do not condone this behavior and I do not stand behind any racist/ misogynistic comments of any sort. As a proud\u00a0Latino, this is something that is quite upsetting and I will no longer be utilizing his services.\u201dUntil this week, Abbasi was listed as the treasurer for mayoral candidate Kam Buckner\u2019s campaign committee. He is still\u00a0listed as treasurer\u00a0for eight other campaign committees. On January 15,\u00a0Buckner disavowed Abbasi in a tweet, saying that he had a \u201cpurely administrative title,\u201d that Buckner was \u201cincredibly disturbed\u201d by Abbasi\u2019s racist and misogynist posts, and that Abbasi was \u201cnever part of our regular working team and hasn\u2019t spent time in our campaign office.\u201d\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader, Buckner\u2019s campaign reiterated the disavowal. \u201cHe was the campaign\u2019s election lawyer during the petition process. He was never on the finance committee. As the campaign\u2019s lawyer, he was registered as campaign treasurer on the Illinois Board of Elections.\u201dAbbasi also said he hadn\u2019t worked directly for Buckner\u2019s campaign and that he forgot he was listed as its treasurer."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

That claim is false. According to the\u00a0FBI\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics, about 29 percent of people arrested for violent crimes, property crimes, or drug-related crimes are Black.\u00a0Abbasi told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0that he did not remember writing the \u201c13/50\u201d group chat, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t remember what I tweeted two days ago,\u201d but admitted that he could not rule it out. He confirmed that he wrote all of the others.\u00a0On January 6, Abbasi\u00a0retweeted a photoshopped picture\u00a0another user posted of him wearing Ku Klux Klan regalia and sitting next to Kanye West. He said he retweets \u201cevery photoshop people make of me\u201d and that doing so is \u201can exercise in absurdity.\u201dIn another group chat message, Abbasi wrote, \u201cNow that I\u2019m in a relationship with a 36-year-old woman it gives me leeway to say that child porn sentences are way too long, like anything more than a year for downloading anything is evil.\u201d He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the message was meant as a joke poking fun at Libertarians.He reiterated several times during the interview that the message about a client who \u201ctook care of\u201d him with \u201cPolish girls\u201d who may have been \u201ctrafficked\u201d was entirely fictional and meant as a joke.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll get an idea that sounds funny, and I\u2019ll post it,\u201d Abbasi said. He said that in the group chats he \u201cliked to play the villain, and make up insane things to stir shit up.\u201d He compared himself to Nick Adams, a conservative commentator who served as a surrogate for Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign and has repeated the false claim that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen.\u201d Abbasi added that he thinks Trump is \u201cthe funniest man alive.\u201dAsked about his politics, he said he was anti-war and believes everyone deserves health care. He said that police district councils have to determine \u201chow we\u2019re going to ameliorate the rise in crime, but it has to be done constitutionally and equitably.\u201dHe said he had \u201cno idea who 99 percent\u201d of his 24,000 Twitter followers are and that he believes they have a range of political views. The engagements he gets on social media fill a desire for celebrity that has helped him successfully lose weight, he added. His current \u201cbit\u201d on Twitter is posing as an \u201cAlpha male\u201d who is also a \u201ccloseted homosexual.\u201d\u00a0\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Abbasi\u2019s Twitter profile links to his legal practice, in which he files election paperwork and ballot petition challenges for political candidates. He said he will work for just about anyone, but that in police district council races he exclusively worked for the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP). Earlier this week, WBEZ reported\u00a0that the FOP paid Abbasi $10,000.In December 2022, Abbasi filed petition challenges against progressive candidates who were running together as slates for police district councils. On January 13, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners ruled in favor of the progressives and kept them on the ballot.Abbasi said that the FOP \u201cneeded an election attorney. We came to an agreement.\u201d He added that he has worked for Democrats and Republicans in the past, and \u201cthe focus is doing the job for the client.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care about his clients\u2019 political ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily ideal, [but] for a lot of candidates I\u2019m not even sure of their platform.\u201d\u00a0A candidate for police district council in the 25th District, Abbasi said he was considering running, and that the FOP gave him a \u201cgreen light\u201d because they were not running any other candidates in that district. Had the FOP not consented to him running, he said he may not have.Abbasi also put his own contact information on election filings he submitted for six other candidates. He told the\u00a0Reader\u00a0the FOP referred them to him. Those candidates are:Abbasi also defended \u201cProco\u201d Joe Moreno, a former alderperson who is running for City Council in the First Ward, against a\u00a0petition challenge by two residents, and was the attorney for a petition challenge against one of Moreno\u2019s opponents, Sam Royko. The CEBC ultimately kept both candidates on the ballot.\u00a0Update 1/19/23:\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader,\u00a0Moreno said, \u201cI had no knowledge of this behavior. I do not condone this behavior and I do not stand behind any racist/ misogynistic comments of any sort. As a proud\u00a0Latino, this is something that is quite upsetting and I will no longer be utilizing his services.\u201dUntil this week, Abbasi was listed as the treasurer for mayoral candidate Kam Buckner\u2019s campaign committee. He is still\u00a0listed as treasurer\u00a0for eight other campaign committees. On January 15,\u00a0Buckner disavowed Abbasi in a tweet, saying that he had a \u201cpurely administrative title,\u201d that Buckner was \u201cincredibly disturbed\u201d by Abbasi\u2019s racist and misogynist posts, and that Abbasi was \u201cnever part of our regular working team and hasn\u2019t spent time in our campaign office.\u201d\u00a0In a statement to the\u00a0Reader, Buckner\u2019s campaign reiterated the disavowal. \u201cHe was the campaign\u2019s election lawyer during the petition process. He was never on the finance committee. As the campaign\u2019s lawyer, he was registered as campaign treasurer on the Illinois Board of Elections.\u201dAbbasi also said he hadn\u2019t worked directly for Buckner\u2019s campaign and that he forgot he was listed as its treasurer."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "2023 Chicago mayoral candidate Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda endorsed Samie Martinez, a challenger to incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18. The endorsement puts Garc\u00eda in bed with allies of former Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s fiercest enemies, including former 33rd Ward Ald. Dick Mell. Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald.

In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign.

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

Wright Jr., who had been my pastor for many years. My home church was Trinity United Church of Christ, and I pastored for several years at Church of the Good Shepherd in Washington Park.I was also invited to choose one speaker who would address those who attended the ceremony. Although I had met scores of very admirable people during what was then my more than 40 years of civic engagement in Chicago, my choice was easy: Chuy Garc\u00eda. Why? Because Chuy represented all that I aspired to be: inclusive, compassionate, wise, unflinchingly committed to equity for all, and unfailingly present wherever he could make a difference.I first met Chuy when he worked on Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 mayoral campaign. My late husband, Al Raby, was Washington\u2019s campaign manager at the time. Al quickly grew to love Chuy, because he represented Al\u2019s, and Washington\u2019s, highest value: a city that worked for all of its residents to have full and equal opportunity to succeed and thrive.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the values, however; it was the work. I quickly learned, as have others, that Chuy had seemingly inexhaustible energy to support projects he valued. In 2016, and for several years after that, I was one of three founding trainers in the Multicultural Leadership Academy presented by the Latino Policy Forum. The academy is an eight-month program building leadership skills and cross-cultural understanding among emerging African American and Latino leaders in Chicago.

He could talk the talk, but more importantly, he walked the walk, and that was always evident.My husband, Al, passed away in 1988. At the end of most of the days of our marriage, Al would ask me a question: \u201cPatty, where have your feet been today?\u201d There were two aspects to that question. One was obvious: Where have you been and who have you helped? The less obvious, metaphorical part, was, \u201cWhose shoes have you walked in today?\u201d What have you done to keep building your understanding and compassion?\u201d I can\u2019t imagine that anyone in Chicago can answer both parts of that question more affirmatively than Chuy Garc\u00eda.The People is our section for all opinions and perspectives concerning Black Chicago.

All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.On June 23, 2012, when I was ordained (relatively late in my life) as a minister, I was profoundly honored that the guest preacher for that occasion was the Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., who had been my pastor for many years. My home church was Trinity United Church of Christ, and I pastored for several years at Church of the Good Shepherd in Washington Park.I was also invited to choose one speaker who would address those who attended the ceremony. Although I had met scores of very admirable people during what was then my more than 40 years of civic engagement in Chicago, my choice was easy: Chuy Garc\u00eda. Why? Because Chuy represented all that I aspired to be: inclusive, compassionate, wise, unflinchingly committed to equity for all, and unfailingly present wherever he could make a difference.I first met Chuy when he worked on Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 mayoral campaign. My late husband, Al Raby, was Washington\u2019s campaign manager at the time. Al quickly grew to love Chuy, because he represented Al\u2019s, and Washington\u2019s, highest value: a city that worked for all of its residents to have full and equal opportunity to succeed and thrive.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the values, however; it was the work. I quickly learned, as have others, that Chuy had seemingly inexhaustible energy to support projects he valued. In 2016, and for several years after that, I was one of three founding trainers in the Multicultural Leadership Academy presented by the Latino Policy Forum. The academy is an eight-month program building leadership skills and cross-cultural understanding among emerging African American and Latino leaders in Chicago. Chuy gave a lot of thought and attention to that program, helping us with the original design and continuing to show\u00a0 up year after year to interact with the participants. They always wanted more from him, and he gave it.\u00a0\u00a0He also showed up at other programs I led or created from 2012 onward, including monthly dinner meetings, called Unity Dinners,\u00a0 among residents of North Lawndale and Little Village to build more understanding between those communities, and health programs for staff and participants at community-based organizations such as Chicago Commons, Erie Neighborhood House and Enlace.\u00a0He didn\u2019t rush in, recite some canned talking points, and rush out \u2013 his comments were always thoughtful and tailored to the attendees, and they could tell that he really wanted to be there. He could talk the talk, but more importantly, he walked the walk, and that was always evident.My husband, Al, passed away in 1988. At the end of most of the days of our marriage, Al would ask me a question: \u201cPatty, where have your feet been today?\u201d There were two aspects to that question. One was obvious: Where have you been and who have you helped? The less obvious, metaphorical part, was, \u201cWhose shoes have you walked in today?\u201d What have you done to keep building your understanding and compassion?\u201d I can\u2019t imagine that anyone in Chicago can answer both parts of that question more affirmatively than Chuy Garc\u00eda.The People is our section for all opinions and perspectives concerning Black Chicago.

Because Chuy represented all that I aspired to be: inclusive, compassionate, wise, unflinchingly committed to equity for all, and unfailingly present wherever he could make a difference.I first met Chuy when he worked on Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 mayoral campaign. My late husband, Al Raby, was Washington\u2019s campaign manager at the time. Al quickly grew to love Chuy, because he represented Al\u2019s, and Washington\u2019s, highest value: a city that worked for all of its residents to have full and equal opportunity to succeed and thrive.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t just the values, however; it was the work. I quickly learned, as have others, that Chuy had seemingly inexhaustible energy to support projects he valued. In 2016, and for several years after that, I was one of three founding trainers in the Multicultural Leadership Academy presented by the Latino Policy Forum. The academy is an eight-month program building leadership skills and cross-cultural understanding among emerging African American and Latino leaders in Chicago. Chuy gave a lot of thought and attention to that program, helping us with the original design and continuing to show\u00a0 up year after year to interact with the participants. They always wanted more from him, and he gave it.\u00a0\u00a0He also showed up at other programs I led or created from 2012 onward, including monthly dinner meetings, called Unity Dinners,\u00a0 among residents of North Lawndale and Little Village to build more understanding between those communities, and health programs for staff and participants at community-based organizations such as Chicago Commons, Erie Neighborhood House and Enlace.\u00a0He didn\u2019t rush in, recite some canned talking points, and rush out \u2013 his comments were always thoughtful and tailored to the attendees, and they could tell that he really wanted to be there. He could talk the talk, but more importantly, he walked the walk, and that was always evident."

  "text": "2023 Chicago mayoral candidate Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda endorsed Samie Martinez, a challenger to incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18. The endorsement puts Garc\u00eda in bed with allies of former Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s fiercest enemies, including former 33rd Ward Ald. Dick Mell. Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "Is Chuy out of step with the progressive movement? Black and brown leaders weigh in",
  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18.

Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep.

This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching.

However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

En el 2017 a solo 21 a\u00f1os, Green lleg\u00f3 a los titulares nacionales cuando le dijo a una audiencia de MSNBC Townhall que el ex alcalde Rahm Emanuel no se preocupa por la gente Negra.Hoy, contin\u00faa confrontando a los pol\u00edticos de frente; durante foros de candidatos recientes, llam\u00f3 a los opositores por ocupar el cargo durante a\u00f1os pero no actuar con urgencia para sanar el trauma de la comunidad y mejorar las condiciones de los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latines.\u00a0El 3 de enero, Green invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a la oficina de su campa\u00f1a en la 87 y Halsted en el vecindario de Auburn Gresham. Cubierto con letreros de \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green para Alcalde\u201d, con un autob\u00fas de campa\u00f1a estacionado afuera de su oficina, anteriormente un bano Chase, se destaca en un centro comercial en ruinas. Para entrar a la oficina repleta de voluntarios, entre ellos los hijos de Green, tuvimos que presentar identificaciones con fotograf\u00eda.Durante nuestra entrevista, Green no se retract\u00f3 de su punto de vista cual tiene desde hace mucho tiempo sobre la policia y vigilancia.\u00a0\u201cNo invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero para aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia\u201d, dijo Green. En su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, Green pide una reforma policial que haga que \u201cla vigilancia sea m\u00e1s atractiva\u201d.Comparti\u00f3 ideas sobre la creaci\u00f3n de un banco p\u00fablico que sea propiedad de la ciudad que dar\u00eda a los residentes el poder de invertir en sus comunidades. Las prioridades del banco ser\u00edan viviendas asequibles, propiedad de viviendas, nuevos desarrollos y pr\u00e9stamos para peque\u00f1as empresas.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiere reducir la violencia a la mitad, crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios y lanzar \u201cuniversal 3K\u201d, cual es preescolar para ni\u00f1es de hasta tres a\u00f1os en adelante.\u00a0Sin embargo, sin ninguna experiencia pol\u00edtica ejecutiva, algunos votantes de Chicago se preguntan c\u00f3mo Green, el candidato m\u00e1s joven de la carrera, har\u00e1 realidad sus nobles ideas.\u00a0Adem\u00e1s, se le ha relacionado con algunas pol\u00e9micas en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En 2021, hizo circular rumores en las redes sociales sobre la renuncia de Lightfoot. \u00c9l tuite\u00f3: \u201cLori Lightfoot renunciar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana en un sorprendente final para su alcald\u00eda\u201d. M\u00e1s tarde se disculp\u00f3 y el tuit se elimin\u00f3 desde entonces.Cuando les organizadores de la liberaci\u00f3n liderado por mujeres Negras y queer en Chicago, como BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters y Let Us Breathe Collective, expresaron su oposici\u00f3n a la campa\u00f1a de Lightfoot del 2019 debido a su afiliaci\u00f3n con la junta de polic\u00eda, Green la respald\u00f3.\u00a0Dijo que la asesor\u00f3 en la Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud y durante la pandemia de COVID-19, pero luego los dos comenzaron a chocar. En el 2021 llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n a Lightfoot por bloquear su esfuerzo por convertir la escuela primaria Garrett Morgan en el vecindario de Auburn-Gresham, cerrada por Emanuel, en un centro juvenil de $15 millones.Y en diciembre del 2022, una disputa de a\u00f1os entre Green y el campo del oponente Willie Wilson se desbord\u00f3 cuando la grabaci\u00f3n de audio supuestamente entre el asesor pol\u00edtico de Wilson, Rickey Hendon, y el voluntario de la campa\u00f1a de Green, Kevin Hobby, se filtr\u00f3 en las redes sociales, detallando un soborno para que el equipo de Green abandonara la petici\u00f3n contra Wilson. Desaf\u00edo contra Wilson. En el 2019, Hendon desafi\u00f3 las firmas de petici\u00f3n de Green y Green se retir\u00f3 de la contienda.\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Green como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: La generaci\u00f3n de millennials de Chicago desafiaron las expectativas en las elecciones intermedias del 2022 como el segundo bloque de votantes m\u00e1s grande. En el 2012, los millennials Negros de Chicago, tras el asesinato policial de Rekia Boyd, tambi\u00e9n crearon el cimiento para el movimiento emergente de la liberaci\u00f3n Negra. Usted fue parte de la comunidad organizadora que busc\u00f3 justicia para Laquan McDonald. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el liderazgo de la generaci\u00f3n millennial a nivel de alcalde?Ja'Mal Green: Los habitantes de Chicago han visto que la pol\u00edtica de la ciudad no ha funcionado y no est\u00e1 en los mejores intereses de la clase trabajadora com\u00fan. Ahora estamos en un momento crucial en el que la generaci\u00f3n joven no tiene esperanza. Los j\u00f3venes mueren, cometen actos de violencia o son atrapados robando autos. Algunos est\u00e1n tratando de criar familias en Chicago.\u00a0Simplemente no hay ning\u00fan tipo de esperanza en este momento. Familias de toda la ciudad, se est\u00e1n yendo. Los negocios se van. Chicago est\u00e1 dispuesta a arriesgarse con alguien que tenga un plan, se preocupe por los ciudadanos comunes, sea m\u00e1s joven y presente ideas innovadoras.\u00a0Una de las cosas m\u00e1s importantes de esta carrera es que Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el cambio. Todav\u00eda tienen que obtener los resultados que han necesitado durante tanto tiempo. No se han sentido seguros durante tanto tiempo. [Los funcionarios electos] hicieron promesas que no cumplieron y [los residentes de Chicago] est\u00e1n listos para probar algo nuevo.Creciste en las \u00e1reas del sur y oeste de Chicago. \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 vivir en estas dos partes de la cuidad su pol\u00edtica y perspectiva de la vida?Crec\u00ed en Gresham. Ha sido mi hogar durante toda mi vida. La primera cuadra en la que viv\u00ed fue la 86 y Union. Esos eran propietarios que se preocupaban por la cuadra y todos los j\u00f3venes de la cuadra.Ten\u00eda al Sr. Riley, que acababa de morir, que me daba un d\u00f3lar por cada \"A\" que ten\u00eda, y ten\u00edamos un pueblo. Mirando hacia atr\u00e1s en todos los otros lugares en los que he vivido, no hay otro bloque como ese. Eso me dio una base que me mostr\u00f3 c\u00f3mo es un pueblo y c\u00f3mo las personas pueden unirse y amarse unos a otros y cuidarse unos a otros y cuidar a los hijos de los dem\u00e1s.Mi pap\u00e1 estaba en K-town. Lo visitaba para estad\u00edas prolongadas y los fines de semana. Vi las diferencias en cada lado de la ciudad, donde las comunidades no ten\u00edan los recursos que necesitaban, donde la gente sufr\u00eda y necesitaba servicios de salud mental, o carec\u00edan de un hogar, o algunos estaban involucrados en alg\u00fan tipo de actividad criminal porque no tengo alternativa. Todo lo que he visto en estos vecindarios me convirti\u00f3 en la persona que soy hoy para saber que necesitamos un enfoque pol\u00edtico m\u00e1s centrado en las personas.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se ingreso en la contienda por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago por segunda vez consecutiva? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no postularse para un puesto en el Concejo Municipal de Chicago?Ning\u00fan miembro del concejo municipal ha sido elegido alcalde de la ciudad de Chicago. Entonces, la segunda parte de eso es la visi\u00f3n, y la agenda que debe avanzar en nuestra ciudad debe avanzar en la parte superior, y es por eso que me postulo para alcalde.No busco ser un pol\u00edtico de carrera e ir de asiento en asiento. Busco tener el impacto que necesito tener a gran escala y luego apartarme del camino, pasar la antorcha e inspirar a otra generaci\u00f3n a dar un paso al frente. Me postul\u00e9 para alcalde la \u00faltima vez y me retir\u00e9 antes de la votaci\u00f3n.Esta es t\u00e9cnicamente mi primera candidatura porque en realidad estoy en la boleta electoral. No ten\u00edamos la infraestructura que necesit\u00e1bamos [en aquel entonces]. Esta vez tenemos mucho apoyo en toda la ciudad. El reconocimiento de mi nombre es muy alto en toda la ciudad. Las docenas de empresas y miles de personas que ayudaron a impulsar esta campa\u00f1a han sido asombrosas. As\u00ed que decid\u00ed participar esta vez porque me llamaron y porque la gente quiere una nueva voz, una voz joven que represente a todo Chicago.Los rumores, o simplemente lo que comenta la gente, es que la \u00faltima vez esperaba conseguir un puesto en la administraci\u00f3n de Lightfoot.No. Nunca trabajar\u00eda para una administraci\u00f3n. Porque no necesito hacerlo. Tengo muchos negocios, y ser\u00eda un conflicto para m\u00ed. Entonces, con Lori, la aconsej\u00e9 cuando me lo pidi\u00f3 y la ayud\u00e9 con las pol\u00edticas hasta que no pudimos llevarnos bien.\u00bfHay algo espec\u00edfico que puedas nombrar que estabas apoyando o aconsejando?S\u00ed. La Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud. Hice una peque\u00f1a serie con ella en l\u00ednea durante la pandemia desde el principio para ayudarla a hablar sobre COVID-19. Los videos tuvieron alrededor de 100.000 visitas en l\u00ednea y les fue bien.As\u00ed que trat\u00e9 de ayudarla a humanizarla y hacer que se quedara con pol\u00edticas reales que tuvieran sentido. Pero Lori es Lori. Al final del d\u00eda, reconozco por qu\u00e9 no nos ca\u00edmos bien durante seis a\u00f1os antes de eso. Solo trat\u00e9 de decir que quiero que la ciudad sea mejor, y no te estoy pidiendo nada. No necesito el dinero. no necesito nada No necesito un trabajo. Quiero estas pol\u00edticas para que estos j\u00f3venes tengan espacios y caminos para ser productivos.No pude lograr eso con ella y esta administraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed que me postulo para que esto suceda.Cuando se habla de violencia armada, muchas veces olvidan a les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine. Por lo general, usted habla sobre la violencia armada, especialmente cuando afecta a les ni\u00f1es. \u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 usted en la seguridad? \u00bfY hay formas fuera de la vigilancia en las que invertir\u00e1 en la seguridad? \u00bfPuede describir c\u00f3mo se ver\u00e1 esa inverci\u00f3n?Hoy lanzamos un plan de $5 mil millones. Eso se llama EPIC: Prevenci\u00f3n de la prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, intervenci\u00f3n y reforma del CPD. La base de nuestro programa es garantizar que creamos vecindarios pr\u00f3speros donde invertimos en los j\u00f3venes y donde CPD es un sistema de apoyo y no una fuerza opresiva. No invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero en aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia.\u00a0Adoptaremos un enfoque hol\u00edstico y haremos las cosas de la manera correcta. Entonces, cuando hablas de prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, nuestro n\u00famero de la suerte es 10,000. Queremos crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios de vivienda al instituir bonos hipotecarios unifamiliares y pr\u00e9stamos retroactivos a nivel de ciudad cada a\u00f1o para que podamos repoblar los vecindarios. Por lo tanto, las personas que est\u00e1n en esos vecindarios o se han ido y tienen ra\u00edces, ya sea que se muden a los suburbios o a otras ciudades, los incentivamos para que regresen respaldando su pr\u00e9stamo, brind\u00e1ndoles un pago inicial y asistencia para los costos de cierre.Me encantar\u00eda volver a eso porque tengo preguntas sobre viviendas asequibles y sobre las rentas de inquilinos.Entonces, una de las piezas se llama Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Esencialmente, de lo que se trata es de que vamos a tener un programa de asistencia directa en efectivo, donde vamos a dar $1,000 por mes a 10,000 familias cada a\u00f1o para sacarlas de la pobreza.Todos los participantes de este programa deber\u00e1n tomar una clase de educaci\u00f3n financiera. Luego, tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1n 90 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s del inicio de los pagos para hacer una de cuatro cosas: obtener vivienda, inscripci\u00f3n educativa, tratamiento por abuso de sustancias o asegurar una oportunidad de trabajo. Har\u00e1n una de esas cuatro cosas. Despu\u00e9s de eso, pueden continuar recibiendo asistencia en efectivo durante el a\u00f1o.\u00a0Los evaluaremos ese a\u00f1o y podr\u00e1n volver a presentar una solicitud para un segundo y \u00faltimo a\u00f1o. Con este programa de $150 millones, es importante brindar los cimientos a las personas que lo necesitan y sacarlos de la pobreza. Muchos estudios han demostrado que al proporcionar efectivo directo a personas que viven tiempos dif\u00edciles, la mayor parte de ese dinero se gasta en sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, ya sea vivienda, comida, etc.Ha dicho que quiere que los impuestos que paga la gente de Chicago dejen de ser usados para pagar la facturas que cubren los costos de las demandas por mala conducta policial. Tambi\u00e9n mencion\u00f3 que quer\u00eda que los polic\u00edas obtengan seguro. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso?Ese sigue siendo el caso. Todav\u00eda estamos examin\u00e1ndolo y averiguando c\u00f3mo implementarlo. No vamos a seguir pagando $100 millones por mala conducta policial. No va a suceder bajo mi supervisi\u00f3n, y ser\u00e1 una prioridad de mi administraci\u00f3n implementar y aprobar un plan para que ese proyecto de ley vaya a otra persona.Deber\u00eda ir en nombre de la polic\u00eda. Si tienen un seguro de responsabilidad civil, las compa\u00f1\u00edas de seguros pueden evaluar la responsabilidad sobre si son un riesgo en funci\u00f3n de sus quejas. Entonces, si obtienen casos de seguros de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, esa compa\u00f1\u00eda los dejar\u00e1. Si no tienen seguro, no pueden ser polic\u00edas en las calles de Chicago.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 debemos seguir permitiendo que los agentes de polic\u00eda acumulen millones de d\u00f3lares en acuerdos y no hay rendici\u00f3n de cuentas? Jason Van Dyke le dispar\u00f3 a Laquan 16 veces. Pero antes de ese caso, ya ten\u00eda acuerdos de seis cifras de casos en los que actu\u00f3 de manera inapropiada.Tenemos que empezar a responsabilizarlos. Tambi\u00e9n vamos a multar a los oficiales con hasta $5,000 si [ellos] apagan sus c\u00e1maras corporales o hacen un uso inadecuado del equipo.\u00a0Tendremos tolerancia cero con los agentes de polic\u00eda que se afilien a grupos de odio.Implementaremos una aplicaci\u00f3n en la que las personas puedan calificar sus interacciones con los agentes de polic\u00eda. Supongamos que tiene una interacci\u00f3n con la polic\u00eda. En ese caso, podr\u00e1 calificar al oficial de polic\u00eda, as\u00ed como cargar datos en tiempo real [para] tener evidencia de un caso. Pueden ir a una agencia de investigaci\u00f3n para poder verlo, y tambi\u00e9n podemos recompensar a los oficiales de polic\u00eda que obtienen buenas interacciones [de] la comunidad.Por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n vamos a ayudar a los polic\u00edas de la fuerza. Los suicidios est\u00e1n en su punto m\u00e1s alto. Vamos a aumentar la cantidad de terapeutas por distrito policial y vamos a cambiar nuestro horario de trabajo a una semana laboral de cuatro o tres d\u00edas con un d\u00eda de salud mental en el medio para que podamos comenzar a controlar las tasas de suicidio en el departamento de polic\u00eda.En su sitio de web, mencion\u00f3 que desea crear hogares de sanaci\u00f3n donde aquellos que sufren problemas de salud mental puedan encontrar refugio. Y tambi\u00e9n acaba de mencionar que se enviar\u00e1 un trabajador social capacitado a los hogares para reducir la tensi\u00f3n en situaciones que no sean de emergencia. Eso suena similar a la ordenanza de Treatment Not Trauma, tratamiento no trauma. \u00bfApoya esa ordenanza?Pasaremos Tratamiento No Trauma. Necesitamos reabrir las instalaciones de salud mental que cerr\u00f3 Rahm Emanuel.\u00bfCu\u00e1l es s\u00fa plan para eso?Planeamos reabrir cl\u00ednicas y encontrar los mejores lugares en las comunidades para abrir centros de bienestar que utilicen un enfoque hol\u00edstico de la salud mental. Ser\u00e1 una instituci\u00f3n donde podr\u00e1 obtener servicios de consejer\u00eda, yoga, boxeo, k\u00e1rate, masajes terap\u00e9uticos y tratamientos de spa.Necesitamos invertir en eso para que las personas de toda la ciudad, ya sean j\u00f3venes, polic\u00edas o quienes sean, puedan ver esta instituci\u00f3n como un lugar donde pueden relajarse. Nuestra idea innovadora es tomar lo que est\u00e1n haciendo y expandirlo a una instituci\u00f3n a la que todos quisieran ir.Como parte de la generaci\u00f3n de millennials usted parece estar m\u00e1s conectado con la juventud Negra y Latine en Chicago en formas que las otras campa\u00f1as no lo est\u00e1n, principalmente a trav\u00e9s de su trabajo con Majostee All Stars. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es importante para usted apoyar y elevar las voces de los j\u00f3venes de Chicago? \u00bfEs ese un compromiso que mantendr\u00e1 si es elegido como alcalde?Una de las cosas que consegu\u00ed que hiciera la actual alcalde fue transmitir mi idea de tener la primera Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud en la ciudad para asesorar a la oficina del alcalde. Es muy importante que se escuchen las voces de los j\u00f3venes. Una vez you fui joven. Todavia recuerdo cuando la gente dec\u00eda que estaba muy joven y que necesitaba quedarme en mi lugar y que mi voz no ten\u00eda mucha importancia.\u00a0Por eso es importante para m\u00ed asegurarme que se invierta en los j\u00f3venes y eliminar las barreras. Nuestros l\u00edderes se han aferrado constantemente al poder y al dinero; esencialmente, est\u00e1n esperando morir. Luego, cuando mueran, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el siguiente plan? Como no capacitan a la pr\u00f3xima generaci\u00f3n, no colocan a los j\u00f3venes en posiciones de poder. No invierten en los j\u00f3venes. Solo quieren que sigamos votando por ellos hasta que tengan 100 a\u00f1os. Eso no es justo. Eso no debe de ser as\u00ed. As\u00ed no es como deber\u00eda ser. Los j\u00f3venes necesitan la oportunidad de ocupar puestos para crecer y prosperar, y ese es mi compromiso.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?La calidad de la educaci\u00f3n debe ser determinada por el ingreso medio del vecindario. Uno de los mayores problemas de nuestra ciudad es que tenemos un sistema escolar de inscripci\u00f3n selectiva. Obtuvimos una f\u00f3rmula basada en la inscripci\u00f3n en el estado y comunidades desinvertidas. Por lo tanto, se ha desinvertido de las escuelas. Fui a muchas escuelas p\u00fablicas y tuve desaf\u00edos. Yo era uno de los ni\u00f1es m\u00e1s brillantes de todas las escuelas y tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda dificultades con mi comportamiento. Mostr\u00e9 ciertos comportamientos que las escuelas no estaban preparadas para abordar o para darme la atenci\u00f3n que necesitaba.Lo que sucede en el distrito es que si tienes un ni\u00f1e con desaf\u00edos, escribir\u00e1n un IEP (Programa de Educaci\u00f3n Individualizado) y tratar\u00e1n de obtener alg\u00fan medicamento o algo as\u00ed.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que no hay un enfoque hol\u00edstico real. Los j\u00f3venes de estos vecindarios que est\u00e1n pasando por tanto trauma, que tienen tanto dolor, que podr\u00edan estar sin hogar y hambrientos, entran a un edificio escolar y se espera que aprendan dos m\u00e1s dos sin el plan de estudios, los libros o la tecnolog\u00eda adecuados. Estamos fallando a los j\u00f3venes todos los d\u00edas en las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago.\u00a0Necesitamos asegurarnos de presionar a la legislatura estatal para que cambie la f\u00f3rmula para las escuelas p\u00fablicas. Debe estar basado en las necesidades. Queremos invertir para asegurarnos de que programas de entrenamiento de trabajo y trabajos tecnol\u00f3gicos est\u00e9n en las escuelas de toda la ciudad. Necesitamos alternativas para los j\u00f3venes y asegurarnos de que est\u00e9n aprendiendo habilidades y diferentes campos profesionales que puedan seguir.\u00a0Necesitamos invertir en los j\u00f3venes desde temprano. As\u00ed que estamos presentando un plan de preescolar para garantizar que haya programas y escuelas p\u00fablicas en toda la ciudad donde les ni\u00f1es de tan solo tres a\u00f1os puedan comenzar a aprender antes incluso de pasar al prek\u00ednder que los har\u00e1 m\u00e1s inteligentes y va a estimular sus mentes. Es bueno para las madres solteras que buscan cuidado de ni\u00f1os y quieren trabajar.Necesitamos ense\u00f1ar a estos j\u00f3venes temprano para que puedan tener las habilidades que necesitan para ser lo mejor que puedan ser cuando crezcan. Universal 3K es un plan que tambi\u00e9n queremos implementar.Los j\u00f3venes de Chicago tienen muy pocos lugares para reunirse y socializar de manera segura. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS?Necesitamos invertir en espacios seguros. Hay mucha gente en la ciudad que est\u00e1 haciendo un buen trabajo con los j\u00f3venes. No necesitamos reinventar lo que ya se esta haciendo o tener nosotros que ser la fuerza impulsora detr\u00e1s de todo. Necesitamos ver d\u00f3nde est\u00e1n las personas que hacen el trabajo e ir a ellas y decirles, \u201c\u00bfc\u00f3mo pueden expandirse? \u00bfCu\u00e1nto necesitas para expandirse?\u201d Para que podamos tener espacios realmente seguros donde los j\u00f3venes puedan crecer y prosperar. As\u00ed que destinaremos mucho dinero para crear espacios seguros para los j\u00f3venes en nuestras comunidades.\u00bfEst\u00e1 familiarizado con la ordenanza de GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfel apoyar esa ordenanza se alinea con su compromiso con la juventud de Chicago?S\u00ed, fui mentor de muchos j\u00f3venes involucrados en GoodKid MacCity\u2019s Peach Book a lo largo de los a\u00f1os. Armaron un buen plan.Estoy seguro de que hay algunos ajustes que podemos modificar y mejorar. El punto es que hay una organizaci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes que se presentan y dicen, \u201caqu\u00ed hay un plan\u201d, especialmente aquellos j\u00f3venes que arriesgan sus vidas diariamente y est\u00e1n al frente de todo. Necesitan una voz, \u00bfverdad? As\u00ed que ll\u00e9venlos a la mesa, escuchen el plan y vean c\u00f3mo podemos fortalecer ese plan, trabajar juntos y crear algo que funcione.En el video de su campa\u00f1a, anunci\u00f3 su deseo de apoyar y expandir que las personas sean propietarios de su vivienda. Anteriormente en nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, habl\u00f3 sobre querer obtener 10,000 o m\u00e1s nuevos propietarios en el futuro. Tiene un marco o iniciativa existente que cre\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de la organizaci\u00f3n My Turn to Own. \u00bfEs ese un modelo que cree que se puede usar a mayor escala? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?My Turn to Own es una organizaci\u00f3n que ense\u00f1a a las personas c\u00f3mo convertirse en propietarios de viviendas y les brinda la educaci\u00f3n financiera que necesitan. Luego, despu\u00e9s de someterlos al proceso y lograr que sean due\u00f1os de una casa, tambi\u00e9n les ense\u00f1amos c\u00f3mo mantener esa casa en el proceso.\u00a0Esto es muy importante porque respaldaremos pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios a gran escala. Hay personas en comunidades que ni siquiera conocen sus puntajes de cr\u00e9dito y ni siquiera saben c\u00f3mo calificar porque han estado alquilando durante tantas d\u00e9cadas que nunca ha estado en su radar. Entonces esa ser\u00e1 una pieza clave de nuestra administraci\u00f3n para expandir algo as\u00ed en toda la ciudad.Muchos de nuestros lectores son inquilinos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas implementar\u00e1 para proteger a las personas del desplazamiento y apoyar a las personas sin hogar?Tenemos que aumentar la cantidad de viviendas asequibles. No tiene sentido que ni siquiera podamos construir 2,500 unidades de viviendas asequibles al a\u00f1o. Daremos subsidios fiscales a las grandes tiendas, iglesias, bancos y personas que poseen grandes edificios para construir unidades de viviendas asequibles. Incentivaremos a las personas a construir sobre cualquier espacio de un solo piso o un edificio de un solo piso.\u00a0El Banco P\u00fablico es otra gran pieza de la que hablo mucho. Crearemos nuestro propio motor econ\u00f3mico al tener un banco p\u00fablico que invierta en pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios, casas asequibles y peque\u00f1as empresas. Esa ganancia del banco vuelve directamente a los servicios de la ciudad.As\u00ed que vamos a construir viviendas basadas en ingresos en la ciudad de Chicago, y el sector p\u00fablico tendr\u00e1 mucho control sobre esas rentas. Luego, como parte de incentivar esas unidades de vivienda asequible, tambi\u00e9n nos aseguraremos de que existan criterios para mantener los precios accesibles de renta de las unidades que est\u00e1n construyendo.Soy alguien que apoya mucho el tener establecido acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios para que los desarrolladores privados que est\u00e1n construyendo sepan que tienen que seguir esos acuerdos. No podemos esperar a que un desarrollador privado venga al vecindario a construir unidades de vivienda asequibles.Apoya Bring Chicago Home, la iniciativa llamada Regresar Chicago a Casa?S\u00ed, apoyo la propuesta de Bring Chicago Home de tener un flujo de financiaci\u00f3n dedicado para personas sin hogar y viviendas asequibles.Anteriormente en la conversaci\u00f3n, mencion\u00f3 a qui\u00e9n usted asume su responsabilidad. Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?Pondremos diferentes cosas en su lugar para permitir que los organizadores tengan un asiento en la mesa. Por ejemplo, estamos buscando una comisi\u00f3n, una especie de agente de poder, donde los organizadores laborales y la gente en primera l\u00ednea pueden tener una gran voz en la oficina del alcalde.\u00a0Eso es clave para m\u00ed. Esperamos rendir cuentas por todo lo que decimos. Estoy en la contienda hablando de lo que voy a hacer lo cual es parte de mi historial de lo que he hecho. Soy el \u00fanico candidato con un historial de hacer todas estas cosas.\u00a0Cuando llegas al gobierno, las cosas pueden cambiar. Por eso la gente no conf\u00eda en los pol\u00edticos. Estoy tratando de cambiar eso. Quiero la confianza de la gente de Chicago y, por lo tanto, en todo lo que diga, har\u00e9 todo lo posible para mantener mi palabra. Estamos siempre abiertos a que la gente nos recuerde que tenemos que asumir nuestra responsabilidad. Este es un juego de palabras, y le doy mi palabra a la gente de Chicago."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "text": "El oto\u00f1o pasado, Brandon Johnson, el comisionado del condado de Cook ingres\u00f3 en la contienda por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago del 2023. Su campa\u00f1a progresista esta centrada en la creaci\u00f3n de coaliciones a trav\u00e9s de diferentes grupos raciales.Johnson ha obtenido el respaldo de pol\u00edticos como Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) y Delia Ramirez (IL-4) que son miembros de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes; el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago, SEIU Healthcare, el Sindicato de Maestros Universitarios del Condado de Cook y la Federaci\u00f3n de Maestros de Illinois. Tiene $1.8 millones disponibles.\u201cEstoy en la posici\u00f3n de ser el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago porque el movimiento est\u00e1 siendo escuchado y yo soy un reflejo de ese movimiento\u201d, dijo Johnson.\u00a0El 3 de enero, Johnson, que vive en el vecindario de Austin con su esposa e hijos, invit\u00f3 a miembros de The TRiiBE a principle barbers una barber\u00eda en North Lawndale. Despu\u00e9s de un r\u00e1pido corte de cabello por su amigo Bobby Price, habl\u00f3 sobre su visi\u00f3n para Chicago.A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, Johnson enfatiz\u00f3 la necesidad de primero invertir en la gente. Aboga por escuelas comunitarias, oportunidades de empleo, acceso a viviendas econ\u00f3micas, la financiaci\u00f3n de programas de verano para j\u00f3venes y una oficina de prevenci\u00f3n de violencia de armas.Reiter\u00f3 su compromiso a redirigir fondos de la polic\u00eda y las c\u00e1rceles hac\u00eda los servicios p\u00fablicos. Este fue uno de sus compromisos que lider\u00f3 como comisionado en el 2020.\u201cUno prioriza debido en los valores que uno tiene\u201d, dijo Johnson. \u201cCreo en nuestra gente. Amo a nuestra gente, y todo lo que quiero para mis hijes, lo quiero para todos les ni\u00f1es de la ciudad de Chicago, y quiero que los padres tengan la oportunidad de proveer lo mismo a sus hijes\u201d.Johnson fue maestro de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago en la Academia Jenner en el vecindario de Cabrini Green. Como organizador del Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago (CTU), form\u00f3 parte de la huelga de maestros del 2012 y se uni\u00f3 con organizadores comunitarios que compart\u00edan la visi\u00f3n social progresista del sindicato. Muchos, al igual que \u00e9l, ahora son funcionarios electos como la representante estatal Lakesia Collins (9th) y consejales Jeanette Taylor (20th), Byron Sigcho-L\u00f3pez (25th) y Carlos Ram\u00edrez-Rosa (35th).Johnson se uni\u00f3 con Taylor en el 2015. Ambos se unieron con padres y miembros de la comunidad en una huelga de hambre de 34 d\u00edas exigiendo que la ciudad reabriera la escuela secundaria Walter H. Dyett de Washington Park. Los huelguistas de hambre salvaron la escuela. Con el nuevo nombre, Dyett High School for the Arts, su primera clase de la secundaria se gradu\u00f3 en el 2020.\u00a0El distrito de Johnson est\u00e1 rodeado por Austin en el lado este y los suburbios de Bellwood en el lado oeste. Le dijo a The TRiiBE que inicialmente no estaba tratando de ser un pol\u00edtico, pero se sinti\u00f3 obligado a hacerlo porque a los l\u00edderes electos los \u201cest\u00e1bamos presionando pero no reaccionaban, as\u00ed que tuvimos que vencerlos\u201d.\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Johnson como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad.The TRiiBE:\u00a0 Al crecer, \u00bfqu\u00e9 impacto su pol\u00edtica y perspectiva de la vida?Mis padres quienes son l\u00edderes y pastores ayudaron a moldear mi visi\u00f3n del mundo.\u00a0La forma m\u00e1s sencilla en que puedo articular esto es que no somos solo para nostros mismos, tenemos una responsabilidad con los dem\u00e1s y seremos m\u00e1s fuertes si trabajamos colectivamente. Poder ver por el projimo y tambi\u00e9n reconocer sus intereses y necesidades es parte de reconocer que somos parte de algo m\u00e1s grande que nosotros mismos y tenemos que asumir responsabilidad a ese llamado. Eso es lo que molde\u00f3 mi visi\u00f3n del mundo. As\u00ed es como he liderado como esposo, padre, maestro, organizador y como comisionado del condado, y cu\u00e1les son mis intenciones como alcalde de Chicago.Ser\u00edas el primer alcalde viviendo en el West Side, el lado oeste de la ciudad. \u00bfC\u00f3mo ha moldeado sus puntos de vista el vivir y trabajar en Austin?La din\u00e1mica en el West Side, oeste de Chicago, particularmente Austin, es la parte de la ciudad Negra m\u00e1s grande dentro de la ciudad de Chicago. Es un lugar hermoso. Tiene una tremenda rica historia. Muchos de nuestros parientes y miembros de la familia y Negros en general, durante esa segunda migraci\u00f3n, se instalaron en el West Side, oeste de Chicago.Tambi\u00e9n es el lugar que visit\u00f3 el Dr. King. Estamos en el Norte de Lawndale. Entonces, aqu\u00ed es donde el Dr. King quer\u00eda asegurarse de estar conectado con las personas que describi\u00f3 como las personas m\u00e1s reales del mundo. As\u00ed es el West Side, oeste de Chicago. Es un lugar muy aut\u00e9ntico. La expresi\u00f3n completa de lo que es ser Negro en esta ciudad est\u00e1 en el West Side, oeste de Chicago, donde la gente es trabajadora. Ya sabes, gente de clase media, l\u00edderes pol\u00edticos. Tienes artistas. Entonces tienes a todos, desde Dorothy Tucker hasta Robert Townsend.El West Side, oeste de Chicago ciertamente ha sido un lugar donde el poder pol\u00edtico Negro y la existencia Negra han encontrado su riqueza en una variedad de disciplinas. Y es el lugar donde, de nuevo, la gente que trabaja todos los d\u00edas viene solo para poder experimentar lo que es justo, pero que, hasta cierto punto, es simplemente relajante.La violencia armada es un problema en Chicago. En su sitio de web, usted dice que es el mayor problema de la ciudad y se compromete a tomar medidas preventivas para abordar la violencia armada. \u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 su administraci\u00f3n en la seguridad?Los estudios de investigaci\u00f3n han indicado que el empleo juvenil reduce la violencia. Y si lo hace. Lo m\u00e1s importante que podemos hacer para reducir la violencia es contratar a j\u00f3venes y darles oportunidades que han faltado en nuestro espacio pol\u00edtico durante demasiado tiempo. Simplemente no hemos hecho lo suficiente.No podemos simplemente seguir parchando el problema. Es por eso que pido un programa de contrataci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes muy s\u00f3lido que brinde el tipo de oportunidades y el prop\u00f3sito que los j\u00f3venes necesitan. Lo segundo es el lanzamiento de una oficina de violencia de armas y prevenci\u00f3n de la violencia para que pongamos todas las soluciones t\u00e1cticas que saquen las armas de la calle.Lo tercero es que Chicago est\u00e1 bajo un trauma enorme. Si no estamos tratando de sanar ese trauma y solo estamos haciendo cosas que lo exacerban a\u00fan m\u00e1s, entonces no estamos siendo muy honestos acerca de nuestro deseo de ver la transformaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Chicago. Eso requiere, de nuevo, alguien que crea en los alojamientos p\u00fablicos. Y entonces reabrir nuestras cl\u00ednicas de salud, que muchos organizadores, organizadores Negros, particularmente en la ciudad de Chicago, han estado presionando para eso. Yo voy a responder a eso. La ordenanza The Treatment Not Truma, Tratamiento No Trauma, est\u00e1 patrocinada por el concejal del Distrito 33 [Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez]. Tenemos muchos organizadores Negros en la ciudad que han estado presionando por eso. Voy a responder a eso positivamente.Como ha de saber, la primavera pasada, la alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot extendi\u00f3 el toque de queda juvenil en toda la ciudad despu\u00e9s del tiroteo de un joven de 16 a\u00f1os en Millennium Park, a pesar de que los cr\u00edticos dijeron que afectar\u00ed desproporcionadamente a los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latine. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS? \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas o pol\u00edticas hay que redactar?Sabemos que las escuelas pueden ser lugares centrales donde la comunidad se puede reunir e organizar. La segunda cosa es que tenemos parques incre\u00edbles a los cuales no se ha invertido para que sean lugares para j\u00f3venes. Empecemos por ah\u00ed. Mis hijos asistieron a Garfield Park durante el verano. El programa de verano termina a la una. Gracias a Dios por Memaw; mi suegra y por su ayuda. De lo contrario, el horario del programa no funcionar\u00eda para mi familia.Entonces, la iniciativa, seria no solo expandir los espacios comunitarios dentro de nuestro sistema de escuelas p\u00fablicas, pero tambi\u00e9n expander los servicios para j\u00f3venes en el distrito de parques.\u00a0Todas esas cosas son importantes. Voy a invertir en esas cosas. Pero tambi\u00e9n se trata de garantizar que los j\u00f3venes tengan un sentido de prop\u00f3sito y sepan que alguien los ama y se preocupa por ellos. Como alcalde de Chicago, especialmente como alguien que ha ense\u00f1ado en escuelas p\u00fablicas, s\u00e9 identificar la mirada de desesperaci\u00f3n.\u00a0Si los j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n preparados y dispuestos a participar en la programaci\u00f3n, y est\u00e1n dispuestos a trabajar, habr\u00e1 un espacio para ellos. Vamos a encontrar los recursos para financiarlo. Para que no sea solo un lugar para que los j\u00f3venes lo est\u00e9n pasandola bien. Es un lugar donde est\u00e1n contribuyendo. Porque lo mejor que podr\u00edas hacer por cualquier ser humano es ayudarlo a encontrar su prop\u00f3sito. Y como alcalde de Chicago, har\u00e9 eso.Usted present\u00f3 una resoluci\u00f3n no vinculante que la Junta del Condado de Cook aprob\u00f3 en el verano de 2020 que apoy\u00f3 la redirecci\u00f3n de \"fondos de la vigilancia y el encarcelamiento a servicios p\u00fablicos no administrados por las fuerzas del orden que promuevan la salud y la seguridad de la comunidad de manera equitativa\". \u00bfTodav\u00eda apoya la reasignaci\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares fuera de la polic\u00eda?La adicci\u00f3n que tiene esta ciudad, y francamente este pa\u00eds, a las c\u00e1rceles y el encarcelamiento ha demostrado ser problem\u00e1tica. \u00bfDe verdad estamos m\u00e1s seguros? \u00bfSe sienten seguras las personas caminando en nuestras comunidades? Mi hijo de 15 a\u00f1os, que estudia en la secundaria Kenwood, en su tercera semana en la escuela, uno de los estudiantes sale a almorzar y lo asesinan, y estamos gastando $5 millones al d\u00eda [en vigilancia].Estamos hablando de un presupuesto de $ 3 mil millones. Y la tasa de aprobaci\u00f3n para resolver cr\u00edmenes es abismal. La gente todav\u00eda no tiene una conexi\u00f3n s\u00f3lida y confiable entre las fuerzas del orden p\u00fablico y la comunidad. Gastamos m\u00e1s dinero en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos que en viviendas y prevenci\u00f3n de la violencia. Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el \u00edmpetu detr\u00e1s de esto. Como alcalde de Chicago, me dedico a hacer lo que funciona.Si decimos que tenemos que llegar hasta la ra\u00edz de lo que ha causado dolor y ha afectado a las comunidades en las que no se ha invertido por generaciones, entonces hag\u00e1moslo. El objetivo de la resoluci\u00f3n del 2020 era motivarnos a hacer lo que funciona y alejarnos de estos malos h\u00e1bitos que solo exacerban las condiciones en las que decimos que estamos tratando de transformarnos y cambiar.Hagamos lo que hacen las comunidades seguras. Ellos financian completamente sus escuelas. Mire Oak Park, dos distritos escolares totalmente financiados en una ciudad. Tienen bibliotecas que permanecen abiertas hasta las nueve de la noche con programas. Tienen parques que son totalmente apoydados. Aman tanto a sus hijes que brindan oportunidades para que les ni\u00f1es puedan vivir su ni\u00f1ez como debe de ser. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es diferente para aquellos de nosotros que vivimos en Chicago? No deber\u00eda ser asi, y como alcalde de Chicago, vamos a transformar eso.Vamos a dejar de depender de estos sistemas antiguos que contin\u00faan da\u00f1ando y aterrorizando a nuestras comunidades. Cuando sabemos que las cosas que funcionan requieren que amemos a nuestres hijes, que amemos a las personas que los cr\u00edan e invirtamos en elles. Claramente, mi posici\u00f3n sigue siendo la misma. Amo a nuestra gente lo suficiente como para invertir en elles y lo har\u00e9 como alcalde de Chicago.La pregunta principal que la gente quiere saber y tener una respuesta clara es sobre el presupuesto de CPD. \u00bfEs algo que aumentara o disminuir\u00eda con usted como alcalde?El presupuesto policial actual es de casi $3 mil millones y nuestras comunidades no son m\u00e1s seguras. No podemos seguir por un camino que ha demostrado que obviamente no funciona.Se trata de enfocarnos en d\u00f3nde deben de estar nuestras prioridades. Puedo decir enf\u00e1ticamente, y basado en el historial, que mis prioridades ser\u00e1n la educaci\u00f3n, la vivienda economica, la salud mental, el trabajo, el transporte y nuestros parques. Ah\u00ed es donde van a estar nuestras prioridades. Mire, vamos a tener que examinar todos los aspectos del presupuesto de la ciudad, pero este, en particular, ha demostrado que el rendimiento que se\u00a0 dijo que obtendr\u00edamos como resultado de estas inversiones no se ha dado como resultado.No hay regreso a esa supuesta inversi\u00f3n. No me voy a comprometer a continuar con cosas del presupuesto que hayan demostrado que han fallado a nuestra gente y a nuestras comunidades. Yo me he he comprometido a la justicia para las vidas de Negras, un presupuesto para las vidas Negras, y eso no cambiara cuando sea alcalde de Chicago. Tenemos que invertir en las \u00e1reas en las que sabemos que funcionan. En este momento, la forma en que se sit\u00faa este presupuesto, particularmente en torno a la vigilancia, no ha funcionado.\u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela? Muchos tienen que ir a otros vecindarios de la ciudad porque sus escuelas no tienen los recursos que necesitan para prosperar academicamente.Ser\u00e9 el primer alcalde en la historia reciente que realmente cree en la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica porque no solo soy un producto de las escuelas p\u00fablicas, mis hijes son estudiantes de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago. Entonces, cuando hablamos de la din\u00e1mica dentro de la comunidad, mi esposa y yo vivimos en Austin, y llevamos a nuestros hijes de ocho y diez a\u00f1os quienes est\u00e1n en tercer y quinto grado, hasta el noroeste en Portage Park que toma de 20 a 25 minutos para llegar.Nuestro hije de 15 a\u00f1os [es] un estudiante del primer a\u00f1o de secundaria en la escuela Kenwood. As\u00ed que lo llevamos al sur lo cual toma entre 25 a 30 para llegar, principalmente porque no tenemos una escuela en Austin que apoye completamente las artes. Entonces tuvimos que salir de nuestra comunidad para que elles tengan la oportunidad de tomar clases de orquesta, deporte y enfermeras en la escuela. Estas no son cosas inalcanzables.\u00a0Lo primero que voy a impulsar es algo llamado Escuelas Comunitarias Sostenibles. Es una pol\u00edtica que hemos estado promoviendo a trav\u00e9s del trabajo de las organizaciones comunitarias y laborales, donde los trabajadores y la comunidad se unen para brindar el tipo de comunidades escolares enriquecidas o totalmente apoyadas que se necesitan.\u00a0\u00a0Lo segundo, por supuesto, es asegurarnos de tener un plan para ayudar a transformar nuestras escuelas secundarias porque, como mencionaron, es importante tener en cuenta que la baja de estudiantes que se inscriben en ciertas escuelas que estamos viendo es por dise\u00f1o.Esto no es algo que ocurri\u00f3 por casualidad. Hemos tenido administraci\u00f3n tras administraci\u00f3n en esta ciudad que ha interrumpido la vivienda p\u00fablica. Cerraron las escuelas p\u00fablicas y eliminaron el trabajo de los empleados p\u00fablicos, de lo que se beneficiaban en particular la gente Negra. Por lo tanto, no deber\u00eda sorprendernos que la cantidad de estudiantes y familias que perdimos durante el cierre de las escuelas sea casi equivalente a la cantidad necesaria para mantener un barrio Negro.\u00bfSera tan simple como solo invertir en escuelas suficientemente para solucionar el problema de la disminuci\u00f3n de estudiantes que se matr\u00edculan en las escuelas? \u00bfQu\u00e9 otras cosas a largo plazo se necesitan? Usted mencion\u00f3 las escuelas comunitarias sostenibles y el segundo punto es un plan para transformar las escuelas secundarias. \u00bfQu\u00e9 otras cosas propone fuera de eso?Lo mejor que puede hacer por la educaci\u00f3n y el \u00e9xito acad\u00e9mico de un ni\u00f1o es asegurarme de que sus padres tengan formularios W-2. Sin embargo, tenemos que tener un compromiso con la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y la financiaci\u00f3n.Si les ni\u00f1es vienen a la escuela todos los d\u00edas sin hogar, hambrientos y enfermos, no est\u00e1n pensando en analizar conclusiones, el enfoque del autor, equilibrar ecuaciones o la tabla peri\u00f3dica.\u00a0Como alcalde de Chicago, mi prioridad principal es asegurarme de que las personas que no tengan una base de seguridad econ\u00f3mica tengan acceso a la seguridad econ\u00f3mica. Todo lo dem\u00e1s se convierte no solo en un estr\u00e9s para esa familia en particular. Se convierte en un estr\u00e9s para la comunidad y se convierte en un estr\u00e9s para el gobierno. Para aliviar ese estr\u00e9s, tenemos que brindar oportunidades. Lo m\u00e1s importante que tenemos que hacer es crear oportunidades para las personas que tienen que ir a trabajar todos los d\u00edas, tener trabajos con salarios decentes, acceso a seguro m\u00e9dico y que los traten con dignidad y respeto en sus trabajos.A partir del 2025, Chicago tendr\u00e1 una junta escolar electa. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo trabajar\u00e1 para apoyar este esfuerzo? \u00bfY a qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00eda para la junta h\u00edbrida?Estoy muy emocionado de que en medio de un pa\u00eds donde la democracia est\u00e1 siendo restringida, en realidad la estamos expandiendo en Chicago. La alcaldesa de Chicago [la alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot] prometi\u00f3 eso, y luego se hecho para atras y fue en contra de una de sus promesas de campa\u00f1a. As\u00ed que quiero enfocarme un poco en sus acciones, porque en realidad lo que hizo es una falta de respeto incre\u00edble debido al trabajo, el tiempo, el esfuerzo y los sacrificios que la gente hizo para tener ese tipo de responsabilidad democr\u00e1tica.Hemos perdido escuelas y hemos perdido educadores Negros, y el plan de estudios se ha reducido en torno al control de la alcaldeza. El control de la alcaldeza no ha sido solamente un fracaso en particular para la gente Negra, pero tambi\u00e9n para el sistema educativo. Esto es lo que har\u00e9 en el 2024 porque no tendremos la junta totalmente electa hasta el 2026.Voy a ir a la comunidad y voy a ir al Concejo Municipal para asegurarme de que la representaci\u00f3n que tenemos para esas 11 posiciones refleje los valores que desde el inicio realmente promovieron la creaci\u00f3n de la junta escolar representativa electa. Tiene que ser gente que realmente crea en los alojamientos p\u00fablicos.\u00a0Tienen que creer que un presupuesto que lleve en mente las necesidades de la gente. Tienen que creer que la fuerza de docente y toda la fuerza educativa, ya sea un asistente de maestro, un maestro, una enfermera o un conserje, que los trabajadores deben ser apoyados. Estos valores son la base para cualquier persona que vaya a estar en la junta escolar que vaya a pasar por un proceso de investigaci\u00f3n con la comunidad y el Concejo Municipal, y tienen que defender esos tres principios. Cualquier cosa menos que esto ser\u00eda irresponsable. Simplemente seguira m\u00e1s de lo mismo.\u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus planes para reabrir las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental que actualmente estan cerradas?Estoy trabajando con defensores de la salud mental. Parte de mi criterio tiene que ser d\u00f3nde la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita es peor. Miremos vecindarios como Englewood, North Lawndale, Garfield Park o Roseland, donde la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita se han descrito en ciertas partes de la ciudad como [comparables a] pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Esta es una de las ciudades m\u00e1s ricas del mundo, y tenemos partes de la ciudad que reflejan las condiciones de naciones en desarrollo.Los defensores que entienden y conocen este trabajo ayudar\u00e1n a guiar c\u00f3mo reabrir y c\u00f3mo clasificar estos espacios. Estoy incre\u00edblemente impresionado con los j\u00f3venes organizadores Negros que han liderado esto. No solo tendr\u00e1n un asiento en la mesa del quinto piso, pero van a poder ayudar a implementar los cambios. Lo que estoy diciendo es que [como m\u00ednimo], la base tiene que ser la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita. Donde esas dos din\u00e1micas se cruzan, debemos comenzar a construir desde all\u00ed. Voy a apoyarme en los expertos y los organizadores para ayudar a guiar eso en mi administraci\u00f3n.\u00bfQu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas o iniciativas promulgar\u00e1 para ayudar a los inquilinos y propietarios de viviendas a evitar el desplazamiento? Y tambi\u00e9n, \u00bfqu\u00e9 har\u00e1 para apoyar a las personas sin hogar?Nadie deber\u00eda ser demasiado pobre para poder vivir en la ciudad de Chicago. Nadie. Entonces, parte de lo que tenemos que hacer es asegurarnos de que el impuesto a la transferencia de bienes ra\u00edces ser revise para descubrir c\u00f3mo asignar d\u00f3lares a esas familias sin vivienda. Lo segundo que tenemos que hacer es que tenemos que tener un compromiso real hacia la viviendas p\u00fablicas. Por eso es que estoy a favor de no construir nada en terrenos que alguna vez fueron viviendas p\u00fablicas.La tercera cosa es el tipo de inversiones que necesitamos hacer en nuestras comunidades, particularmente en torno a los ingresos. Eso es algo en lo que como alcalde de Chicago me concentrar\u00e9 mucho, en ingresos progresivos para poder hacer el tipo de inversiones para abordar la inseguridad econ\u00f3mica que se est\u00e1 presentando, particularmente en casos de las viviendas p\u00fablicas.Menciono el Impuesto de Transmisiones Patrimoniales. \u00bfEso significa que apoyas Bring Chicago Home, la iniciativa llamada Regresar Chicago a Casa?S\u00ed, lo apoyo.Usted mencion\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente a los propietarios de viviendas, pero muchos de nuestros lectores son inquilinos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tipo de apoyo ve para ayudar a las personas a poder pagar la renta?Si no estamos brindando oportunidades econ\u00f3micas reales para que la gente realmente consiga trabajo y ofrezca trabajos bien pagados, ya sea que la renta sea de $ 675 o\u00a0$1,200 d\u00f3lares al mes, si no tiene una oportunidad econ\u00f3mica real para tener un buen trabajo decente bien pagado, vamos a seguir perdiendo talento, especialmente dentro de nuestra comunidad.Eso desde crear oportunidades en el espacio p\u00fablico en el que tendr\u00e9 jurisdicci\u00f3n para desafiar a nuestras corporaciones para incentivarlas a contratar a nuestra gente. Entonces, una de las cosas que estamos impulsando es que para nuestras corporaciones m\u00e1s grandes, hay formas en las que podemos proporcionar incentivos fiscales y aumentar los ingresos y los incentivos fiscales. Contratar a nuestra gente en estas grandes corporaciones podr\u00eda aliviar algunas de las cargas fiscales de las que algunas de estas corporaciones quieren alg\u00fan alivio. Al mismo tiempo, si las corporaciones no est\u00e1n priorizando a nuestra gente, entonces tendran que contribuir de otras formas si no estan contratando a nuestra gente.\u00a0Francamente, para muchas de estas iniciativas vamos a necesitar la intervenci\u00f3n de Springfield, de las cuales muchas de esas cosas que se he propuesto como organizador, las apoyare mucho. Va a requerir relaciones, especialmente en torno a c\u00f3mo vemos el costo de la renta, y c\u00f3mo nos aseguramos de que la renta no supere los ingresos en los que muchos de nuestros j\u00f3venes profesionales Negros en particular est\u00e1n atrapados. Entiendo muy bien que requiere alguna intervenci\u00f3n del estado para asegurarnos de que ese alivio est\u00e9 disponible.Ha recibido importantes respaldos financieros de varios sindicatos nacionales y locales, incluida la Federaci\u00f3n Estadounidense de Maestros, el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago, SEIU Healthcare y United Working Families. \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 manera asume usted su responsabilidad ante los sindicatos que lo respaldan? \u00bfY cu\u00e1l es su relaci\u00f3n con esos grupos?Asumo mi responsabilidad ante todas las personas a las que representar\u00e9. Asumo mi responsabilidad ante los trabajadores, ante aquellos que luchan por existir en la clase media, y ante aquellas familias que est\u00e1n pasando por la pobreza. Asumo mi responsabilidad ante aquellas familias que han experimentado un poco de seguridad econ\u00f3mica pero a\u00fan no se sienten seguros.Mi relaci\u00f3n con el movimiento laboral est\u00e1 profundamente ligada a una larga historia en este pa\u00eds donde los derechos civiles y los derechos laborales han trabajado mano a mano para finalmente traer justicia econ\u00f3mica a la gente Negra. As\u00ed que esa es mi relaci\u00f3n. Como docente de estudios sociales, soy consciente de ello. Soy consciente de eso. Fui criado por alguien que era parte del movimiento obrero. Mi padre era un empleado p\u00fablico que formaba parte del Sindicato de Trabajadores de AFSCME. Entonces, hay una larga historia de trabajadores Negros atados al movimiento laboral que tambi\u00e9n luchaban por los derechos civiles en Chicago, y yo soy parte de esa historia.Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?La rendici\u00f3n de cuentas es importante. Mira, como te dije, soy uno de 10 [hijos]. As\u00ed que he aprendido a ser responsable de mis hermanos menores, pero tambi\u00e9n hacia mis hermanos mayores. La mejor manera en que el movimiento puede asegurarse de que asuma mis responsabilidades es manteniendose conectado con la administraci\u00f3n. No tienen que esperar a que mi administraci\u00f3n convoque una reuni\u00f3n comunitaria o una reuni\u00f3n familiar.\u00a0\u00a0Vamos a aprobar uno de los presupuestos m\u00e1s dram\u00e1ticos para el tercer a\u00f1o de mi administraci\u00f3n, debido a los desaf\u00edos estructurales que las administraciones anteriores han ignorado. Voy a necesitar que nuestra familia me ayude a hacer eso. Espero que nuestra familia me acompa\u00f1e y tambi\u00e9n mire lo que he hecho hasta ahora.No hay otro candidato que arm\u00f3 un presupuesto completo en torno a las necesidades de la gente Negra. No s\u00e9 si alguien ha hecho eso en todo el pa\u00eds. Soy el \u00fanico candidato en esta contienda que pidi\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente invertir en cosas que funcionan y no en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos. Nadie tuvo que entrar y golpear mi puerta para convencerme de hacer lo que he prometido hacer.\u00a0Habr\u00e1 fuerzas por ah\u00ed tratando de interrumpir eso y separarnos unos de otros. Esas fuerzas han estado tratando de hacer eso durante cu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os en este pa\u00eds, separando a la gente Negra de nuestros intereses. Soy docente de estudios sociales, tengo claro c\u00f3mo se ve eso. Quiero unir a la familia. Por eso me postulo para alcalde de Chicago, reunamos a la familia. Cuando se ponga dif\u00edcil, hay que estar unidos y construir juntos. La administraci\u00f3n que voy a dirigir como alcalde de Chicago tiene que ver con construir puentes, no cerrar puentes.\u00a0No hay otro candidato que arm\u00f3 un presupuesto completo en torno a la gente Negra de Chicago. No s\u00e9 si alguien ha hecho eso en todo el pa\u00eds. Soy el \u00fanico candidato en esta contienda que pidi\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente invertir en cosas que funcionan y no en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos. Nadie tuvo que entrar y golpear mi puerta para convencerme de hacer lo que he prometido hacer."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Brandon Johnson",
  "text": "Last fall, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson entered the 2023 Chicago mayoral race with a truly progressive platform and campaign centering coalition-building across racial lines.Since then, Johnson has gotten endorsements from politicians such as U.S. Reps. Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-4); the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Healthcare, Cook County College Teachers Union, and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. He\u2019s got $1.8 million on hand.\u201cI\u2019m in a position to be the next mayor of Chicago because the movement is being heard, and I\u2019m a reflection of that movement,\u201d he said.\u00a0On Jan. 3 Johnson, who lives in Austin with his wife and children, invited The TRiiBE to principle barbers in North Lawndale. After getting a quick edge-up by his friend Bobby Price, he discussed his vision for Chicago.Throughout our interview, Johnson repeatedly emphasized the need to invest in people first and foremost. He advocates for sustainable community schools, employment opportunities, affordable housing, and funding robust summer youth programs and a gun violence and prevention office.He reiterated his commitment to redirecting funds from police and jails to public services, one he led as commissioner in 2020.\u201cYou prioritize based upon the values that you have,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI believe in our people. I love our people, and everything that I want for my children, I want that for every single child in the city of Chicago, and I want parents to be able to deliver that.\u201d\u00a0A former Chicago Public Schools teacher, Johnson started at Jenner Academy in Cabrini Green. As a CTU organizer, he was part of the 2012 strike and connected with community organizers who shared the union\u2019s progressive social vision. Many, like him, are now elected officials: State Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th), and Alds. Jeanette Taylor (20th), Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th).With Taylor, he joined parents and community members in a 34-day hunger strike in 2015 demanding the city reopen Washington Park\u2019s Walter H. Dyett High School. The hunger strikers saved the school. Revived as Dyett High School for the Arts, its first class graduated in 2020.\u00a0Johnson\u2019s district is anchored by Austin on the east side and suburban Bellwood on the west. He told The TRiiBE he wasn\u2019t initially trying to be a politician but felt compelled to because elected leaders \u201cwe were pushing wouldn\u2019t react, so we had to beat them.\u201d\u00a0Read our full interview with Johnson as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.The TRiiBE:\u00a0Growing up, what shaped your politics and outlook on life?As leaders and pastors, my parents helped shape my worldview.\u00a0The simplest way I can articulate this is that we are not our own, we have a responsibility to one another, and are only as strong as we are collectively. So the type of selflessness is the act of service recognizing that we are ultimately accountable to something bigger than ourselves. That's what shaped my view of the world. It's how I've led as a husband, a father, teacher, organizer, and as county commissioner, and what my intentions will be as mayor of Chicago.You would be the first mayor living on the West Side. How has living and working in Austin shaped your views?Yeah, so not a native South sider. But the dynamic on the West Side of Chicago, particularly Austin, it\u2019s the largest Black city inside the city of Chicago. It's a beautiful place. It has a tremendous rich history. Many of our relatives and family members and Black folks in general\u2014during that second migration\u2014set up shop on the West Side of Chicago.\u00a0It's also the place, of course, where Dr. King visited. We're in North Lawndale. So this is where Dr. King wanted to ensure he was connected to people he described as the world's most realest people.\u00a0 That's what the West Side of Chicago is. It's the place where it doesn't get more authentic. The full expression of blackness is on the west side of Chicago, working people. You know, middle-class folks, political leaders. You have artists. So you have everyone from Dorothy Tucker to Robert Townsend.\u00a0\u00a0The West Side of Chicago has certainly been a place where Black political power and Black existence have found its richness in a variety of disciplines. And it is the place where again, everyday working people come just to be able to experience that which is like righteous, but that which is, to some extent, just chill.The dynamic on the West Side of Chicago, particularly Austin, it\u2019s the largest Black city inside the city of Chicago.

And it is the place where again, everyday working people come just to be able to experience that which is like righteous, but that which is, to some extent, just chill.Gun violence is a significant issue in Chicago. On your website, you cited it as a city's biggest problem and pledged to take preventative measures to address it. How will your administration invest in safety?Studies have indicated that youth employment reduces violence. It does. The most dramatic thing that we can do to reduce violence is to hire young people and give them opportunities that have been missing from our political space for too long. We just haven't done enough.We can\u2019t simply nibble around the edges. This is why I\u2019m calling for a very robust youth hiring program that will provide the type of opportunities and purpose that young people need.\u00a0 The second thing is the launch of an office of gun violence and violence prevention so that we are putting together all the tactical solutions that get guns off the street. The third thing is that Chicago is under enormous trauma. If we're not treating that trauma, and we're only doing things that further exacerbate it, then we're not being very honest about our desire to see transformation in the city of Chicago.  So that requires, again, someone who believes in public accommodations. And so reopening our health clinics, which many organizers, Black organizers, particularly around the city of Chicago, have been pushing for that.I'm going to respond to that. The Treatment Not Trauma ordinance is sponsored by the 33rd Ward alderperson [Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez].We have a lot of Black organizers around the city who've been pushing for that. I'm gonna respond to that positively. As you know, last spring, Mayor Lori Lightfoot extended the citywide curfew after the shooting of a 16-year-old in Millennium Park, despite critics saying it would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within CPS and outside CPS? What initiatives or policies need to be drafted?We know that schools can be hubs for the community as a whole.The second thing is this: we have these amazing parks that do not get supportedin a way that can be a place for young people. Let\u2019s just start there. My children attended Garfield Park over the summer.The summer program ends at one o'clock. Thank God for Memaw; that's my mother-in-law. Otherwise, it wouldn't work.So, the initiative, besides expanding community spaces within our public school system, but it\u2019s also our park districts.All those things are important. I\u2019m going to invest in those things. But it\u2019s also about ensuring young people experience purpose and know someone loves them and cares for them. As mayor of Chicago, especially as somebody who has taught in public schools, I know what the look of desperation looks like.\u00a0If young people are prepared and willing to go through programming, and they\u2019re willing to work, there\u2019s going to be a space for them. We\u2019re going to find the resources to fund it. So that it\u2019s not just a place for young people are kicking it. It\u2019s a place where they\u2019re contributing. Because the best thing that you could do for any human being is to help them find purpose. And as mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m gonna do that.You introduced a nonbinding resolution that the Cook County Board passed in the summer of 2020 that supported redirecting \u201cfunds from policing and incarceration to public services not administered by law enforcement that promote community health and safety equitably.\u201d Do you still support reallocating dollars away from police?The addiction that this city, and quite frankly this country has on jails and incarceration has proven to be problematic. Are we any safer? Are our communities walkable? So my 15-year-old son, who's a student in Kenwood, in his third week at school, one of the students leaves out for lunch and gets murdered, and we're spending $5 million a day [on policing].We're talking about a $3 billion budget. and the clearance rate for solving crimes is abysmal. Folks still don't have a trusted, strong connection between law enforcement and the community. We spend more money on jails and incarceration than we do on housing and violence prevention. Here\u2019s the impetus behind it. As mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m about doing what works.If we\u2019re saying that we have to get at the root causes of the ailment that has plagued communities that have been disinvested in for generations, then let\u2019s do that. The whole point of the 2020 resolution was to provoke us into doing what works, and to remove ourselves from these really bad habits that only exacerbate the conditions in which we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re trying to transform and change. Let's do what safe communities do. They fully fund their schools. Look at Oak Park, two fully funded school districtsin one town.They have libraries that stay open to nine o'clock at nightwith programs. They have parks that are fully supported. They love their children so much that they will provide opportunities for children to be able to experience childhood. Why is that any different for those of us who live in Chicago? It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be. And as mayor of Chicago, we\u2019re transforming that.We\u2019re going to stop relying upon these age-old systems that continue to harm and terrorize our communities. When we know that things that work require us to love our children, to love the people who are raising those children and to invest in them. So clearly, my position is still the same. I love our people enough to invest in them and will do that as mayor of Chicago.The main question that people will want to know and have a clear answer to is about CPD\u2019s budget. Is that something you would increase or decrease as mayor?The police budget is almost $3 billion, and our communities aren\u2019t safer.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how we can continue to go down a path that has demonstrated that it doesn\u2019t work.It\u2019s about where our priorities should be. I can say emphatically, and based upon the record that my priorities are going to be in education, housing, mental health, jobs, transportation and our parks. That\u2019s where our priorities are gonna be. Look, we\u2019re going to have to examine every aspect of the city\u2019s budget, but this one, in particular, has demonstrated that the return that folks said we would get as a result of these investments that return hasn\u2019t manifested.There\u2019s no return on that so-called investment. I\u2019m not going to commit to anything budgetarily that has demonstrated that it has failed our people and failed our communities. So you know, as I\u2019ve committed to justice for Black lives, budget for Black lives, that doesn't change when I\u2019m the mayor of Chicago. We have to invest in the areas in which we know that work. Right now,the way this budget is situated, particularly around policing, hasn't worked.What initiatives and policies will you enact for neighborhood elementary and high schools so that Black and brown children won't have to be in their communities to go to school? Many have to leave because their schools don't have the resources they need to thrive.I will be the first mayor in recent history that actually believes in public education because not only am I a product of public schools, my children are the students in Chicago Public Schools. So when you talk about the dynamics within the community, my wife and I live in Austin, and we take two babies \u2014 eight and ten years old; they\u2019re in the third and fifth grades \u2014\u00a0 20 to 25 minutes northwest to Portage Park.\u00a0\u00a0Our 15-year-old [is] a freshman at Kenwood. So we take him 25 to 30 minutes south, primarily because we don't have a school in Austin that fully supports the arts. So we had to leave our community to have orchestra, sports and a nurse. These are not unattainable things.\u00a0The first thing that I'm going to push for is something called Sustainable Community Schools. It's a policy we've been promoting through the work of community-based organizations and labor, where labor and the community are coming together to provide the type of enriched or fully supported school communities that are needed.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing, of course, is making sure that we have a plan to help transform our high schools because, as you mentioned, it's important to note that the decline we are experiencing is by design.This is not something that occurred by happenstance. You've had administration after administration in this city that has disrupted public housing. They've closed public schools and eliminated public employee work, which Black folks, in particular, benefited from. So it shouldn't be a surprise that the number of students and families we lost during the school closings is almost equivalent to the number needed to keep a Black ward.  Is simply investing in schools enough to address the declining enrollment?\u00a0 What are other long-term things needed? You mentioned sustainable community schools, and the second point is a plan to transform high schools. What other things would you propose outside of that?The best thing you can do for a child's education and academic success is to ensure their parents have W-2s. However, we do have to have a commitment to public education and funding.If children are coming to school every single day unhoused, hungry and sick, they\u2019re not thinking about drawing conclusions or the author\u2019s approach or balancing equations or the periodic table.\u00a0As mayor of Chicago, my top priority is to make sure that people will have access to economic security without a baseline of economic security. Everything else becomes not just a stress on that particular family. It becomes a stress on the community and it becomes a stress on the government. To relieve that stress, we have to provide you with opportunities. The big thing that we have to do is create opportunities for folks that have to go to work every day, have decent-paying jobs, access to insurance and they have dignity and respect in their workspaces.So beginning in 2025, Chicago will have an elected school board. So if elected, how will you work to support this effort? And who would you appoint to the hybrid board?I'm very excited that in the midst of a country where democracy is being curtailed, we're actually expanding that in Chicago. The mayor of Chicago [Mayor Lori Lightfoot] promised that, and then she flaked and went against one of her campaign promises.So I want to lean into that a bit because it's actually incredibly disrespectful because of the work, time, effort and sacrifices people put forward to have that type of democratic accountability.We've lost schools, and we've lost Black educators, and the curriculum has been narrowed around mayoral control. Mayoral control has been a failure for Black people in particular, but for the system as a whole. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do in 2024 because we don\u2019t get the fully elected board until 2026.I\u2019m going to go to the community, and I\u2019m going to the City Council to make sure that the representation that we have for those 11 seats reflects the values that actually promoted the elected representative school board in the first place. It has to be people who actually believe in public accommodations.\u00a0They have to believe that a budget has to speak to the needs of people. They have to believe that the teaching force and the entire education force, whether you\u2019re a teacher\u2019s assistant, a teacher, a nurse or custodial, that the workers should be supported. Those are the baseline for anyone who is going to be on the board going to go through a vetting process with the community and City Council, and they have to stand up for those three principles. Anything less than that would be will be irresponsible. It\u2019ll just simply be more of the same.What are your plans to reopen closed mental health clinics?I'm working with mental health advocates. Part of my criteria has to be where violence and poverty per capita is at its worst. Let's look at neighborhoods like Englewood, North Lawndale, Garfield Park or Roseland, where violence and poverty per capita has been described in certain parts of the city as [comparable to] developing nations. This is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, and we have pockets of the city that reflect and mirror developing nations.The advocates who understand and know this work will help guide how we reopen and how we classify these spaces. I\u2019m incredibly impressed with the young Black organizers who have been leading on this. They will have not just have a seat at the table on the fifth floor. They will get to help set it. All I\u2019m saying is that [at] the very least, the baseline has to be violence and poverty per capita. Where those two dynamics intersect, we should start to build up from there. I\u2019m gonna lean on the experts and the organizers to help guide that in my administration.What policies or initiatives will you enact to support renters and homeowners from displacement? And also, what will you do to support people experiencing homelessness?No one should be too poor to live in the city of Chicago. No one. So part of what we have to do is make sure that the real estate transfer tax gets a real look and figure out how to appropriate dollars towards those unhoused families.The second thing that we have to do is that we have to have a real commitment to public housing.So that's why I'm supportive of not building anything on land that was once the home for public housing.The third thing is the type of investments that we need to make in our communities, particularly around revenue. That\u2019s something that, as mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m going to be very much focused on, progressive revenue, to be able to make the type of investments to address the economic insecurity that is playing out, particularly in housing.You mentioned the Real Estate Transfer Tax. Does that mean you support Bring Chicago Home?Yes, I do support it.You specifically mentioned homeowners, but a lot of our readers are renters. What type of support do you see for helping people be able to afford rent?It's two-fold. If we're not providing real economic opportunities for folks [to] actually get jobs and give well-paying jobs whether that rent is $675 or $1,200 dollars month, if you don't have real economic opportunity to have a good decent paying job, we're going to continue to lose talent, especially within our community.So that\u2019s everything from creating opportunities in the public space that I will have jurisdiction over challenging our corporations to incentivize them actually to hire our people. So one of the things that we are pushing is that for our larger corporations, there are ways in which we can provide tax incentives and raise revenue and tax incentives. Hiring our people in these big corporations could alleviate some of the tax burdens that some of these corporations want some relief from. At the same time, if you\u2019re not prioritizing our folks, then you can contribute more skin in the game since you ain\u2019t hiring us.So a lot of these initiatives, quite frankly, we're going to need intervention from Springfield, of which many of those things that have been proposed as an organizer, very supportive of them. It's going to require those relationships, especially around how we look at rent, and how we make sure that rent is not outpacing the income that many of our young Black professionals particularly are stuck in. I very much understand that it does require some intervention from the state to make sure that that relief is available.You've received major financial endorsements from several national and local labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Healthcare and United Working Families. In what ways are you accountable to those labor unions that are endorsing you? And what is your relationship with those groups?I'm accountable to all the people who I will represent. I'm accountable to working people. I'm accountable to those who are struggling to exist in the middle class. I'm accountable to those families that are experiencing poverty. I'm accountable to those families who have experienced some economic security but still don't feel safe.My relationship to the labor movement is deeply tethered to a long history in this country where civil rights and labor rights have worked hand in hand to ultimately bring economic justice to Black folksSo that's my relationship. As a social studies teacher, I'm aware of that. I'm conscious of that. I was raised by someone who was part of the labor movement. My father was a public employee who was a part of the AFSCME Labor Union. So there's a long history of Black workers tethered to the labor movement who were also fighting for civil rights in Chicago, and I'm a part of that history.We\u2019ve witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist organizer language, and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to go back on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?Accountability is important. Look, as I said, I'm one of 10 [children]. So I've learned how to be responsible for my younger siblings, but also accountable to my older siblings. The best way in which the movement can hold me accountable is to stay connected with the administration. You don't have to wait on my administration to call for a community gathering, or for a family sit-down.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to pass one of the most dramatic budgets by the third year of my administration, because of the structural challenges that previous administrations have ignored. I'm gonna need the family to help me do that. I am. I hope that the family will hang in there with me and also take a look at what I've done thus far.There\u2019s no other candidate that put together an entire budget around Black people. I don't know if anyone's done that in the entire country. I'm the only candidate in this race that specifically called for investing in the things that work and not in jails and incarceration. No one had to come in and pound on my door to do what I promised to do.\u00a0There will be forces out there trying to disrupt that and separate us from one another. Those forces have been trying to do that for how many years in this country, separating Black folks from our interests. I'm a social studies teacher, I'm clear on how that looks. I want to bring the family together. That's why I'm running to be the mayor of Chicago, let's bring the family together. When it gets tough, let's hang in there together and let's build it together. The administration that I'm going to lead as mayor of Chicago is all about building bridges; it's certainly ain't going to be raising them.There\u2019s no other candidate that put together an entire budget around Black people.I don't know if anyone's done that in the entire country. I'm the only candidate in this race that specifically called for investing in the things that work and not in jails and incarceration. No one had to come in and pound on my door to do what I promised to do."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "Population: 53,526Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0On Jan. 25, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Emma Mitts (37th Ward) and other elected officials gathered in West Humboldt Park for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a police and fire academy that was built despite protests from some community members.\u00a0\u201cI think this is a win for the United States of America since this is the first joint public safety academy in the United States,\u201d Mitts said during the press conference.\u00a0The training facility was five years in the making. In 2019, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s proposal for the multi-million project because they said further investments in police would mean more state-sanctioned violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, through their grassroots campaign, they demanded that the City fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0Despite the protests, the City Council voted 38 to 8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019 (5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston was the only member of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus\u00a0 who voted against it at the time). Last September, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the total cost to $128 million.\u00a0The facility includes a \u201ctactical scenario village\u201d for police and fire training and a six-story tower, with each floor simulating different environments firefighters encounter.\u00a0The facility sits on a 30.4-acre former rail yard that sat vacant for more than 40 years before the City purchased it in 2017. The site will also include two restaurants and 27,000-square-foot Boys and Girls Club, which will open this summer.\u00a0Mitts faces three challengers in the 37th Ward aldermanic race: Corey Dennelle Braddock, Jake Towers and Howard Ray. She was first appointed to the seat in 2000 by then-Mayor Richard M. Daley. Her predecessor, Percy Giles, was convicted of taking a bribe and sentenced to just over three years in prison in 1999.\u00a0During her tenure, Mitts opened the city\u2019s first Walmart, the ward\u2019s first public library branch, and most recently, the police and fire academy. A not-yet-open but completed Amazon warehouse is also situated in the 37th Ward. There\u2019s also a brand-new youth sports and community center, the North Austin Community Center, that opened its doors on Feb. 2.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed two people who live in the 37th Ward. Both residents spoke with pride about the community within their different blocks in Austin. They also expressed passion for the ward\u2019s future and discussed various improvements that could help the 37th Ward, which has experienced decades of disinvestment.

I mean, it\u2019s not the best. It\u2019s not the worst. Most of the homeowners on my block are seniors because they\u2019ve been there for over 30 to 40 years. There are a few newcomers. Some have moved out to other areas, but most people on my block are seniors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0Where do Black people gather and socialize in the 37th Ward? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I think people are indoors. You don\u2019t see people hanging out. It\u2019s not just happening in the 37th Ward. I think Chicago is deserted now due to COVID and the crime rates. People are scared to come out. Kids don\u2019t come out and play as much because there are drive-bys. This is happening all over. It\u2019s not just in the 37th Ward. The West Side Health Authority is on my block on Division. Young folks like to go there. I noticed a lot of them coming around the neighborhood and passing out flyers for different types of events going on. They\u2019re trying to get the young folks to get involved. But it\u2019s kind of hard, though.\u201d\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to vote right now for early voting.

I don\u2019t support the business because of the labor agreements, but as far as bringing resources to the neighborhood, it was a good thing. But as far as them not employing union people, that\u2019s my issue.\u201dWhat do you like about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0"

Chris Taliaferro Headed to runoffContesting candidates:Population: 53,635Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0Austin was once a bustling community area that boasted more than 120,000 middle-class residents at its peak in 1930. There were street railways to downtown every half mile, and booming businesses on Madison Street, Lake Street and Chicago Avenue.\u00a0However, there\u2019s been a tremendous population loss since then. Today, there are just a little over 53,000 residents in Austin, and most of them are Black. And those bustling business corridors are now vacant lots, dilapidated storefronts and crumbling facades after experiencing decades of divestment.In the 29th ward, incumbent Chris Taliaferro is focused on retaining his aldermanic power after a fleeting run for Cook County Judge in 2021. Contesting candidates CB Johnson, who last ran in 1999, Walter Adamcyzk, a republican, and Corey Dooley, who is facing allegations that he is not a registered voter in the ward, have a hard-won battle ahead.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed three Black women who reside in Austin and in Galewood, a small bungalow enclave within the community. Together, they painted an eclectic portrait of a neighborhood that once had rich communal ties but is now lacking affordable housing, political power, amenities such as grocery stores that are abundant in neighboring towns like Oak Park.

That\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d\u00a0Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cI guess so. I read about him in a paper or something. He\u2019s never come to this block [Newcastle Avenue]. People on this block don\u2019t know who he is. Most of them. And I\u2019ve only seen him at meetings. He\u2019s never ever in the neighborhood.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in person [outside of a political setting] and the one time I reached out to him via email, he responded he would get to repaving our street and alley [in his] next term . . . .Is he really the alderman? Are we in the 29th Ward?\u201d\u00a0What do you like about your ward? \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s nothing to write home about like it was 20 years ago. Because, one thing is, it was like six Blacks on this block when we moved here. Now it\u2019s many more Blacks from Austin that\u2019s on this block now.\u201d\u00a0What do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0How do you get your news? \u201cNextdoor app.\u201d She also used to get a lot of her news from Ald.\u00a0 Nicholas Sposato\u2019s newsletter when she lived in Humboldt Park.What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0More police patrols: \u201cI\u2019ve been here about 13 years and I guess I\u2019ve seen a police car drive through here five times.\u201dNeighborhood you live in: GalewoodOccupation: Retail Store Manager\u00a0Homeowner or renter? Homeowner. Also owns another home in the same neighborhood.Do you feel safe? \u201cYes\u201d.Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cMmhmm. I know he was trying to run for judge but I don\u2019t really know anything [else about him] actually.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him out, only when he was knocking on my door [while campaigning].\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cI\u2019ve owned another house down the street, so 20 years I\u2019ve lived over here. The neighborhood is a quiet neighborhood. Finally, some friendly neighbors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you feel like your neighborhood is communal? \u201cNo, not really. I think on my block it\u2019s more communal, but I think outside of the block, I don\u2019t think people know each other. A lot of blocks have block club parties. We\u2019ve never had one, at least since I\u2019ve been here.\u201dDo you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? I definitely will be up there to vote, as usual. I just voted in this last election. So I definitely plan on voting.\u201dHow do you get your news about the election? \u201cI know Lightfoot\u2019s the current mayor but I don\u2019t know who\u2019s running. I only watch TV.

Chris Taliaferro.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI know him through family relationships. My mother was an avid supporter of his during his first campaign [for alderperson in 2015]. So I am familiar with him on a more personal level. Now, politically? I am not as keen as I would like to be on his platform. The one thing that I do recall him being open and willing to engage in the conversation was around the Anjanette Young ordinance. He participated in the conversation, but it didn\u2019t pass. I sat on the Concerned Women of Illinois Committee of Rainbow PUSH. And we had a forum where he was open to answering questions from not just the West Side, but the statewide coalition of women, regarding the Anjanette Young ordinance.\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cThe West Side is the best side. It\u2019s the rich history and culture, and the families. I\u2019ve lived in Austin for 37 years. There\u2019s so many other families that have remained in the neighborhood and have survived the concerted efforts of disinvestment. I think that the resiliency and pride of the residents is part of the beauty of Austin. And, I mean, Austin does have some really beautiful homes, and Columbus Park is a very beautiful feature of the community as well.\u201dWhat do you dislike?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes. My parents were politicians so I absolutely do vote. I gotta vote. It\u2019s like brushing my teeth. I truly believe that our power, our voice is in our vote. It hits different now.\u201d"

  "text": "2023 Chicago mayoral candidate Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda endorsed Samie Martinez, a challenger to incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18. The endorsement puts Garc\u00eda in bed with allies of former Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s fiercest enemies, including former 33rd Ward Ald. Dick Mell. Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "title": "Lightfoot calls CPS teacher emails a \u2018mistake\u2019",
  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired. Lightfoot said doing so would be the easy political thing to do but explained that it wasn\u2019t the appropriate action to take. Instead, she\u2019s calling what happened a teachable moment.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I\u2019m a role model to young women across the city, and I have an obligation given that to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to teach and mentor,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to learn and for me to be a mentor and nurture her,\u201d she added.\u00a0Also, on Thursday, the City Colleges of Chicago confirmed receiving an email from Lightfoot\u2019s campaign last August seeking student volunteers.\u201cCity Colleges staff notified the campaign of CCC\u2019s ethics policy and purged the emails from CCC accounts. City Colleges is not aware of having received subsequent campaign emails but is looking into the matter,\u201d the statement reads.\u00a0On Wednesday evening, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s campaign came under fire after asking Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage students to help her get re-elected in exchange for school credit. WTTW Politics Reporter Heather Cherone first reported the story.\u00a0\u201cLate yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to the campaign . . . a campaign staffer accessed publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a one-on-one interview with The TRiiBE before a Thursday afternoon press conference. \u201cObviously, that was a mistake. From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ald. Sophia King",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward) carries her roots with her each and every day. Her mother went from picking cotton in the Mississippi Delta to getting a scholarship to Northwestern University, earning a PhD over time while raising her family. Spending her childhood between Mississippi and Evanston deepened King\u2019s love for her culture.King has long been in community with other prominent Black Chicagoans. Barack Obama is a longtime friend and hoop-buddy of her husband (attorney and Chosen Few DJ Alan King), and the former president endorsed her 2017 aldermanic run. And before she got into politics, King helped establish the Ariel Community Academy, and founded Harriet\u2019s Daughters, a group named for Harriet Tubman that brings Black professional women together to increase employment and wealth in the community.\u201cI\u2019ve always been about uplifting our community,\u201d she told the The TRiiBE, noting that as an alder she championed efforts to rename streets after Black luminaries such as Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, the first non-indigenous Chicagoan, and journalists Ida B. Wells and Lerone Bennett Jr.\u00a0As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, King invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 10 to her Kenwood home, about a block away from Louis Farrakhan\u2019s million-dollar manse. King sat on a leather couch in her living room, which was also furnished with a writing desk and accented by esteemed Black literary works such as Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019s The 1619 Project and Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Barracoon, an Indigenous painting, another depicting revolutionary Black men, and a sculpture made by her biological father.\u201cI\u2019m very Afrocentric. Proud of who I am. My mother is a sociologist. I have two fathers. My biological father, who\u2019s passed away, his focus was African American art,\u201d King said. \u201cI get a difference of opinion about who people think I am. They think they know me.\u201dCurrently, King serves as chair of the City Council\u2019s Progressive Reform Caucus, and a member of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus. Since her appointment \u2014 by Rahm Emanuel \u2014 to City Council in 2016, King has been a co-sponsor of multiple progressive initiatives, including the Anjanette Young Ordinance to ban no-knock police raids, the Community Commission of Public Safety and Accountability and the Bring Home Chicago ordinance, and she led the 2014 drive to raise Chicago\u2019s minimum wage to $15.During our interview, King said she doesn\u2019t believe in decreasing the Chicago police budget. She believes that good policing works, and in her public safety plan, that means redirecting resources to community policing, alternative response and violence intervention programs, as well as putting more cops in neighborhoods and \u201cembracing\u201d surveillance technology.Read our full interview with King, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)Why did you enter the mayoral race this year? And what power does being in the mayor's office give you that you don't already have as alderwoman?There are a number of reasons.There's just a lot of dissension coming from the mayor's office between that office and teachers, police, my colleagues \u2014 another one just left yesterday, I believe we\u2019re up to 16.It's not coincidental. There's just a lot of tension.I tried very early to make a connection, because I wanted to see an African American woman do well, as, that\u2019s me, part of me, right? But, yeah, the tension continues. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that this is one of the most difficult periods in the country, in the world, with social unrest, with COVID. And so you have to acknowledge that and put it in that context, and I did.\u00a0But the issue, I think \u2014 and it took me a while \u2014 is that, given that instability and insecurity that everybody was feeling, it was a time when we should have come together as a city, and we didn\u2019t. And again, I think that\u2019s part of leadership.\u00a0And the other reason is because when I saw people stand up [to run for mayor], I didn\u2019t see somebody who could represent the entire city while doubling down in our communities.I represent [a ward that runs] from downtown to Hyde Park, and I have Bronzeville in the middle \u2014 we called it the Low End growing up \u2014 you know, it's very diverse. I got some of the poorest people. I have more CHA senior homes than probably any other ward in the city, but I also have part of downtown. I go up to Jackson Boulevard, Grant Park, Northerly Island, Soldier Field, Museum Campus, and I have Hyde Park, which is kind of the city\u2019s epicenter of diversity and equity. And then I have some of the most segregated parts and poorest parts with plans for transformation sites. I've got Ida B. Wells, I've got the Washington Park Corridor, I've got Lake Park, North Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Douglas. I've got all of the CHA homes. I get to see everything.Most wards are more contiguous, homogenous, and [made up of] similar folks, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s different; I have all of these communities that are very distinct and unique in their own ways. But I also get to see those similarities.\u00a0I have two different police districts; one\u2019s downtown, one south. I get to see the disproportionate amount of resources going to, in real time, I get to see the disproportionate amount of clearance rates. But I also lead with equity. So, with our [aldermanic] menu money, Grand Boulevard gets most of that money because they\u2019re the most under-resourced area that I have.\u00a0I see the juxtaposition of A Tale of Two Cities, as people would say it. But I think that puts me in good stead to kind of understand the challenges that we face as well as what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.And more specifically about the power aspect. What power would you get as mayor compared to the power that you already have as alderwoman?That's a great question. The difference is, as alderman, I spend all my time advocating for resources that the mayor\u2019s office controls on behalf of my constituents. I have no control over it. And not that I want to have control, but I certainly want to be able to get those resources for my community.\u00a0In this diverse ward, crime has touched places where people with power can weigh in, and they're paying attention. I've been able to see the differences and disparity there. But what I can't do is control how officers are deployed in a more equitable fashion. That comes from the mayor's office. If the garbage isn't picked up, if the snow isn\u2019t plowed, the mayor's office controls that. The power is too centralized now. We need to decentralize it so that the community can feel that.\u00a0There's no reason why me as an elected official shouldn't have better communication with the mayor. We share constituents. And so that challenge is a challenge for our city, because there's no way that she can singularly understand how each community is feeling. And that's why the City Council was made to be a strong council/weak mayor, so that you can balance that better. And so that's what I've found, that the challenges that I face for really helping my residents lay in the mayor's office. And so that's where I feel the differences.\u00a0A city councilman really has two jobs. One is to balance a budget every year and legislate. Now, that's probably 10% of what I actually do. Ninety percent of it is truly advocating for, on behalf of, my constituents for their needs, whether that be for housing, or whether it be, you know, for violence intervention programs, or police presence, or homeless insecurities, or all of those things.In October, you said we can deploy drones as first responders, and they can chase offenders if need be, and that we can also use other technology better, such as ShotSpotter. Also, your 10-point safety plan includes immediately increasing police presence in the community. To be honest, much of this sounds similar to efforts by previous administrations who have increased policing and surveillance.\u00a0Is there any evidence that supports that the items that you highlight in your 10-point safety plan will effectively reduce crime in Chicago?For our campaign, the power of \u201cand\u201d is really important. And so in the 10-point Plan, one of the biggest points of it is several hundred million dollars for violence intervention. I think that\u2019s part of it. If you really read it, it\u2019s a people\u2019s racial redress plan. So, you know, having $600 a week to incent our most vulnerable [residents] and those likely to be shot and get shot to come into the legal market and to use wraparound services to supplement that. And, you know, job training, I think that\u2019s the important piece of it.But I do actually think that good policing works. And that's why I said that we can uplift police and hold them accountable, that they're not mutually exclusive. I've seen the evidence of that in my own ward. And I've also seen the evidence of the false narrative that we don't need [police] in our community. So let me explain.It's our communities that have the lowest clearance rates, meaning the unsolved murders, the unsolved shootings, unsolved everything. It's also our communities that disproportionately have less police than everyone else.And I get it. It is not the only solution.How do you want to fund your 10-point plan?The state has billions from the federal government; the city does, so does the county, and everybody's doing their own thing for violence intervention. So we need to come together, pool those resources. I would commit the $200 million from the city, I would get $50 million from the state, I would get $50 million from private industry. Let's take this opportunity to actually do something about [violence] for real this time. So let's put real money towards it. We have it, and we won't in three years. But we should be saying our goal this year is to meaningfully impact 2,000 [residents]. Then next year, another 2,000. And after six months, and a year, they\u2019ll be a productive member of our community, they\u2019ll have a job, so it'll pay for itself ultimately. But the money immediately will come from federal funds that are here. Hell, I got $85 million to spend that [Lightfoot] didn't spend. We as a City Council said violence intervention is a priority. Here\u2019s $85 million. She didn\u2019t spend it. And that also speaks to the dissension; we\u2019ve lost a lot of institutional knowledge at the City, because people have just left. There\u2019s so many vacancies. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s not personal. But it\u2019s hard for us to move our city forward under this leadership, because everybody is either frustrated, moved on, and there is no sense of bringing us together as a city like, \u201cOkay, we know we\u2019ve got these challenges and issues, but how do we do it together?Do you support the SAFE-T Act?Do I support the SAFE-T Act? Yeah, I think they've got some tweaks to [do to] it . . . but in general, I do.Do you support the GoodKids MadCity Peace Book, or any other initiatives outside of policing to invest in safety for Black Chicago neighborhoods?Yeah, I do. I've told them that they need to tweak some of the budget issues, but the ideas of what they're talking about, yeah. I was the first to work with GoodKids MadCity. We put on the 1919 Project around the race riots. I brought them as well as Dr. [Timuel] Black together around that initiative.\u00a0Besides policing, [on] the violence intervention, my recommendation is $300 million per year to put a dent, and kind of long-term systemic issues to really bring people and communities back together. And by the way, that should have an impact on housing, on jobs, on all kinds of things.Does that mean increasing or decreasing the police budget in order to make that happen?I don't believe the police budget needs to be decreased at this point. I will just tell you that. Because first of all, it's hard to tell whether we have enough police or not. But I do know that they're not in the places where they need to be at the right time. I do know that there's a disproportion. I see it. I see that my police district, which had over 600 officers, now has less than 200. And by the way, District 19, which doesn't have nearly [as much] crime, has more than mine. So if we were to redistribute it, would we then have enough? Perhaps.\u00a0I think that's something that I need to take a look at. But what I see right now is that the places that need it the most don't have it, and they should have it in areas. I see how they do it up north. I see how many police are there to mitigate things before they're happening, to be able to talk to the community while they're there to really have that relationship. I think that's needed before things get bad. So, to me, there are two big things. There's the alternative responses to policing, as well as the violence intervention.Do you support Treatment Not Trauma? So it's called all of these things. So that's the mental health first responders, that's the pilot that I got money for singularly. I partnered with Ald. Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez on it, but elevated it to give to her because that's who I am as a leader.I supported it under Rahm when no other aldermen spoke up about bringing that back. So these aren\u2019t things that are new for me. They\u2019re things that are probably new to the public, because I haven\u2019t been about marketing what I do, because I wasn\u2019t doing it for that. I\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t care who gets credit. We just need to get this done. We need to have, you know, mental health first responders in the pilot and the treatment that trauma comes from that, comes from rebuilding the clinics.Mayor Lightfoot promised an elected school board, but later fought against such a board. Will you support an elected school board? And who would you think about appointing to the hybrid aspect of the board?I haven't thought about who I would appoint. But educators are important. It would be important, you know, just to find people who understand how to engage disengaged students, because that's a huge part about it. Also, we need to bring the trades and the tech industry into the schools. And I want to make clear that apprentice programs, you can only access them after you graduate, after you turn 18, and they're generally in the suburbs. They need to be brought to our schools. So I would want somebody who really understands the importance of that and the tech industry. I certainly would want people who understand the impacts of education on the community from a very deep way. Because we really, we have to bring more engagement or more after school programs.I think, ideally, it should have been smaller. It's kind of big and unwieldy. But it is what it's going to be right now. But I certainly like the elected part of it.For decades, the mayor has been at odds with the teachers union, and many rank and file teachers, staff and students who complain about the lack of resources and other\u00a0 important issues within the schools. What do you think the disconnect is there? And what will be your policy around improving CPS, especially in black and brown communities?I have a relationship with CTU. I have a relationship with most of the unions. I would probably say that I\u2019m everybody\u2019s second choice, which is okay, because it shows that I have those relationships. I think if they didn't support Brandon [Johnson], they would support me. But my bigger point is that I have that relationship with them. And I'll continue to have a relationship where you can have honest discussions about what's going on for our kids, and what's in the best interest of our kids.\u00a0Some of the big things in terms of education would be a co-curricular model. And because I come out of education, I use that vernacular, but it's really the after-school programming, to make a whole school. I think that's really important. I think we lose that opportunity to really do that. Because you've got these young babies who, you know, after school, why can't we still engage them? So disengaged students are one of the biggest hurdles that we face.\u00a0I definitely [would] make better use of the park district. There's no reason why high school students shouldn't have some engagement there. That's a missed opportunity.\u00a0I think it\u2019s super important to make sure that not only are our kids\u00a0 introduced to STEM at a very early age, but that we continue that through the job market and bring all these companies and all these universities, like Northwestern, University of Illinois, DePaul, USC. We have some of the best schools in the country, we don't take advantage of that.Historically, we've watched big developments displace and erase black communities in Chicago, and folks in the areas surrounding the upcoming Obama library, for example, are already experiencing some elements of displacement. How would you create policies to support Black residents who are being priced out by new developments, such as the Obama Presidential Center?I've already shown how I've done it. So there are four striking developments in this city, the Obama library, the 78 Lincoln yards, and the Michael Reese Hospital, and I'm over the Michael Reese development. It's being heralded by the New York Times as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But you never heard any protests. We never heard about displacement or about any of that, because we formed a Michael Reese Advisory Committee. We brought people who care about housing, who cared about all of these things to the table, and we ended up with a $25 million commitment for education for schools. We ended up with 20 percent affordable housing on site, which is unheard of. We ended up with a 60 percent commitment to diversity, mostly African American because it's in Bronzeville, we've renamed it \u2014 from Michael Reese to Bronzeville Lakefront.Many of your donors are from the Black elite professional class in Chicago. I noticed that your husband contributed $50,000 to your campaign. According to Illinois Sunshine. How are you accountable to the people who have contributed to your campaign? What did you promise them?Never promise anybody anything. I've gotten contributions in the past six-and-a-half years from different types of people from different walks of life, and I don't look at donations like that. First of all, it's illegal. And second of all, I just, I'm just a different type of person. I know what my North star is, I know why I got into this, and I know that it's not about me, or any personal gains or political gains.I've always been focused on what's best for our community, and our community means something different to me in terms of the city. But again, I still think my background, whether it's in Evanston, Mississippi, all of those things, when people talk about the Great Migration, I lived that. I had an uncle who had to leave the South go to New York, because of fear of being lynched and things of that nature. So it's part of who I am."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "La Concejal Sophia King (Distrito 4) lleva sus ra\u00edces con ella todos los d\u00edas. Su madre pas\u00f3 de piscar algod\u00f3n en el delta del Mississippi a obtener una beca para la Universidad Northwestern y obtener un doctorado con el tiempo mientras criaba a su familia. Pasar su infancia entre Mississippi y Evanston profundiz\u00f3 el amor de King por su cultura.King ha estado en comunidad durante mucho tiempo con otros l\u00edderes prominentes Negros de Chicago. Barack Obama es amigo desde hace mucho tiempo y compa\u00f1ero de baloncesto de su esposo (el abogado y DJ Chosen Few, Alan King), y el expresidente respald\u00f3 su candidatura a concejal en el 2017. Y antes de dedicarse a la pol\u00edtica, King ayud\u00f3 a establecer la Academia Comunitaria Ariel y fund\u00f3 Harriet\u2019s Daughters, un grupo llamado as\u00ed por Harriet Tubman que re\u00fane a mujeres Negras profesionales para aumentar el empleo y la riqueza en la comunidad.\u201cSiempre me ha gustado animar a nuestra comunidad\u201d, dijo a The TRiiBE, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que, como concejal, defendi\u00f3 los esfuerzos para cambiar el nombre de las calles en honor a luminarias Negras como Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, el primer no ind\u00edgena de Chicago, y los periodistas Ida. B. Wells y Lerone Bennett Jr.\u00a0Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a la alcald\u00eda del 2023, King invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 10 de enero a su casa de Kenwood, a una cuadra de la mansi\u00f3n de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares de Louis Farrakhan. King se sent\u00f3 en un su sala en un sof\u00e1 hecho de piel, su casa estaba amueblada con un escritorio y acentuada por apreciadas obras literarias de escritores Negros como The 1619 Project de Nikole Hannah-Jones y Barracoon de Zora Neale Hurston, una pintura ind\u00edgena, otra que representa a hombres negros revolucionarios, y una escultura realizada por su padre biol\u00f3gico.\u201cSoy muy Afroc\u00e9ntrica. Orgullosa de quien soy. Mi madre es soci\u00f3loga. Tengo dos padres. Mi padre biol\u00f3gico, quien falleci\u00f3, su enfoque era el arte Afroamericano\u201d, dijo King. \u201cSiempre hay una diferencia de opini\u00f3n entre la gente acerca de qui\u00e9n piensan que soy. Creen que me conocen.Actualmente, King se desempe\u00f1a como presidente del Caucus de Reforma Progresista del Concejo Municipal y miembro del Caucus Negro Concejal de Chicago. Desde su nombramiento, por Rahm Emanuel, para el Concejo Municipal en el 2016, King ha sido copatrocinadora de m\u00faltiples iniciativas progresistas, incluida la Ordenanza Anjanette Young para prohibir las redadas policiales sin previo aviso, la Comisi\u00f3n Comunitaria de Seguridad P\u00fablica y Responsabilidad y la ordenanza Bring Home Chicago, y lider\u00f3 la campa\u00f1a de 2014 para aumentar el salario m\u00ednimo de Chicago a $15.Durante nuestra entrevista, King dijo que no cree en disminuir el presupuesto de la polic\u00eda de Chicago. Ella cree que una buena vigilancia funciona, y en su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, eso significa redirigir los recursos a programas de vigilancia comunitaria, respuesta alternativa e intervenci\u00f3n contra la violencia, as\u00ed como poner m\u00e1s polic\u00edas en los vecindarios y \u201cadoptar\u201d la tecnolog\u00eda de vigilancia.Lea nuestra entrevista completa con King como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 entr\u00f3 a la carrera por la alcald\u00eda este a\u00f1o? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 poder le dar\u00eda estar en la alcald\u00eda que no tenga ya como Concejal?Hay un n\u00famero de razones. Hay muchos desacuerdos entre la oficina del alcalde y la oficina de los maestros, la polic\u00eda, mis colegas; otro colega se fue ayer, creo que llegamos a 16. No es coincidencia. Simplemente hay mucha tensi\u00f3n.Trat\u00e9 muy temprano de hacer una conexi\u00f3n, porque quer\u00eda ver a una mujer afroamericana hacerlo bien, como, esa soy yo, parte de m\u00ed, \u00bfverdad? Pero, s\u00ed, la tensi\u00f3n contin\u00faa. Ser\u00eda negligente si no mencionara que este es uno de los per\u00edodos m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles en el pa\u00eds, en el mundo, con problemas sociales, con COVID. Y entonces tienes que reconocer eso y ponerlo en ese contexto, y lo hice.\u00a0Pero creo que el problema, y \u200b\u200bme tom\u00f3 un tiempo, es que, dada la inestabilidad y la inseguridad que todos sent\u00edan, era un momento en el que deber\u00edamos habernos unido como ciudad, y no lo hicimos. Y de nuevo, creo que eso es parte del liderazgo.\u00a0Y la otra raz\u00f3n es porque cuando vi a la gente ponerse de pie [para postularse para alcalde], no vi a alguien que pudiera representar a toda la ciudad mientras se duplicaba en nuestras comunidades.Represento [un distrito que se extiende] desde el centro de la ciudad hasta Hyde Park, y tengo a Bronzeville en el medio; lo llam\u00e1bamos Low End (de bajos recursos) mientras crec\u00edamos, ya sabes, es muy diverso. Tengo algunas de las personas m\u00e1s pobres. Tengo m\u00e1s hogares para personas mayores de CHA que probablemente cualquier otro distrito de la ciudad, pero tambi\u00e9n tengo parte del centro de la ciudad. Voy a Jackson Boulevard, Grant Park, Northerly Island, Soldier Field, Museum Campus, y tengo Hyde Park, que es una especie de epicentro de diversidad y equidad de la ciudad. Y luego tengo algunas de las partes m\u00e1s segregadas y m\u00e1s pobres con planes para sitios de transformaci\u00f3n. Tengo a Ida B. Wells, tengo Washington Park Corridor, tengo Lake Park, North Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Douglas. Tengo todas las casas de CHA. Puedo ver todo.La mayor\u00eda de los distritos son m\u00e1s contiguos, homog\u00e9neos y [compuestos por] personas similares, y eso es algo diferente; Tengo todas estas comunidades que son muy distintas y \u00fanicas a su manera. Pero tambi\u00e9n puedo ver esas similitudes.\u00a0Tengo dos distritos policiales diferentes; uno en el centro, otro en el sur. Puedo ver la cantidad desproporcionada de recursos que reciben al momemnto, puedo ver la cantidad desproporcionada de tasas de liquidaci\u00f3n. Pero tambi\u00e9n dirijo con equidad. Entonces, con nuestro dinero del concejal, Grand Boulevard obtiene la mayor parte de ese dinero porque es el \u00e1rea con menos recursos que tengo.\u00a0Veo la yuxtaposici\u00f3n de Historia de dos ciudades, como dir\u00eda la gente. Pero creo que eso me ayuda a comprender los desaf\u00edos que enfrentamos, as\u00ed como lo que funciona y lo que no.Y m\u00e1s espec\u00edficamente sobre el aspecto del poder. \u00bfQu\u00e9 poder obtendr\u00eda usted como alcaldesa en comparaci\u00f3n con el poder que ya tiene como Consejal?Esa es una gran pregunta. La diferencia es que, como concejal, paso todo mi tiempo abogando por los recursos que controla la oficina del alcalde en nombre de mis electores. Yo no tengo control sobre ello. Y no es que quiera tener el control, pero ciertamente quiero poder obtener esos recursos para mi comunidad.\u00a0En este distrito diverso, el crimen ha tocado lugares donde las personas con poder pueden opinar y est\u00e1n prestando atenci\u00f3n. He podido ver las diferencias y disparidades all\u00ed. Pero lo que no puedo hacer es controlar c\u00f3mo se distribuyen los oficiales de una manera m\u00e1s equitativa. Eso viene de la oficina del alcalde. Si no se recoge la basura, si no se quita la nieve, eso lo controla la alcald\u00eda. El poder est\u00e1 demasiado centralizado ahora. Necesitamos descentralizarlo para que la comunidad pueda sentir eso.\u00a0No hay raz\u00f3n por la que yo, como funcionario electo, no deba tener una mejor comunicaci\u00f3n con el alcalde. Compartimos constituyentes. Y entonces ese desaf\u00edo es un desaf\u00edo para nuestra ciudad, porque no hay forma de que ella pueda entender singularmente c\u00f3mo se siente cada comunidad. Y es por eso que el Concejo Municipal fue creado para ser un concejo fuerte y un alcalde d\u00e9bil, para que pueda equilibrar eso mejor. Y eso es lo que descubr\u00ed, que los desaf\u00edos que enfrento para ayudar realmente a mis residentes est\u00e1n en la oficina del alcalde. Y ah\u00ed es donde siento las diferencias.\u00a0Un concejal de la ciudad realmente tiene dos trabajos. Una es equilibrar un presupuesto cada a\u00f1o y legislar. Ahora, eso es probablemente el 10% de lo que realmente hago. El noventa por ciento es realmente abogar por, en nombre de, mis electores por sus necesidades, ya sea para vivienda, o ya sea, ya sabes, para programas de intervenci\u00f3n de violencia, o presencia policial, o inseguridades de personas sin hogar, o todas esas cosas.En octubre, dijo que podemos desplegar drones como socorristas, y que pueden perseguir a los delincuentes si es necesario, y que tambi\u00e9n podemos usar mejor otras tecnolog\u00edas, como ShotSpotter. Adem\u00e1s, su plan de seguridad de 10 puntos incluye el aumento inmediato de la presencia policial en la comunidad. Para ser honesta, gran parte de esto suena similar a los esfuerzos de las administraciones anteriores que han aumentado la vigilancia y la policia en las comunidades.\u00a0\u00a0\u00bfHay alguna evidencia que respalde que los elementos que destaca en su plan de seguridad de 10 puntos reducir\u00e1n efectivamente el crimen en Chicago?Para nuestra campa\u00f1a, el poder de \"y\" es realmente importante. Y as\u00ed, en el Plan de 10 puntos, uno de los puntos m\u00e1s importantes son varios cientos de millones de d\u00f3lares para la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia. Creo que eso es parte de eso. Si realmente lo lees, es un plan de reparaci\u00f3n racial del pueblo. Entonces, ya sabes, tener $600 a la semana para incentivar a nuestros [residentes] m\u00e1s vulnerables y a aquellos que probablemente recibir\u00e1n un disparo y recibir un disparo para ingresar al mercado legal y usar servicios integrales para complementar eso. Y, ya sabes, capacitaci\u00f3n laboral, creo que esa es la parte importante.Pero en realidad creo que la buena vigilancia funciona. Y es por eso que dije que podemos animar a la polic\u00eda y hacerla responsable, que no se excluyen mutuamente. He visto la evidencia de eso en mi propio distrito. Y tambi\u00e9n he visto la evidencia de la narrativa falsa de que no necesitamos [a la polic\u00eda] en nuestra comunidad. As\u00ed que d\u00e9jame explicarte. Son nuestras comunidades las que tienen las tasas de resoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1s bajas, es decir, los asesinatos sin resolver, los tiroteos sin resolver, todo sin resolver. Tambi\u00e9n son nuestras comunidades las que desproporcionadamente tienen menos polic\u00edas que los dem\u00e1s. Y lo entiendo. No es la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n.\u00bfC\u00f3mo quieres financiar tu plan de 10 puntos?El estado tiene miles de millones del gobierno federal; la ciudad lo hace, tambi\u00e9n lo hace el condado, y todos est\u00e1n haciendo lo suyo para la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia. As\u00ed que tenemos que unirnos, juntar esos recursos. Comprometer\u00eda los $200 millones de la ciudad, obtendr\u00eda $50 millones del estado, obtendr\u00eda $50 millones de la industria privada.Aprovechemos esta oportunidad para hacer algo sobre [la violencia] de verdad esta vez. As\u00ed que vamos a poner dinero real para ello. Lo tenemos, y no lo tendremos en tres a\u00f1os. Pero deber\u00edamos decir que nuestro objetivo este a\u00f1o es impactar significativamente a 2,000 [residentes]. Luego, el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o, otros 2,000. Y despu\u00e9s de seis meses y un a\u00f1o, ser\u00e1n miembros productivos de nuestra comunidad, tendr\u00e1n un trabajo, por lo que finalmente se pagar\u00e1 solo. Pero el dinero de inmediato vendr\u00e1 de fondos federales que est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Demonios, yo recibi $85 millones para gastar que [Lightfoot] no gast\u00f3.Nosotros, como Concejo Municipal, dijimos que la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia es una prioridad. Aqu\u00ed hay $85 millones. Ella no lo gast\u00f3. Y eso tambi\u00e9n habla de los desacuerdos; hemos perdido mucho conocimiento institucional en la Ciudad, porque la gente se va. Hay tantas vacantes. Y por eso no es personal. Pero es dif\u00edcil para nosotros hacer avanzes a nuestra ciudad bajo este liderazgo, porque todos est\u00e1n frustrados, siguen adelante y no tiene sentido de unirnos como ciudad como, \"Est\u00e1 bien, sabemos que tenemos estos desaf\u00edos y problemas\", pero \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo hacemos juntos?\u00bfApoya la Ley SAFE-T?\u00bfApoyo la Ley SAFE-T? S\u00ed, creo que tienen algunos ajustes para [hacerle] . . . pero en general, si la apoyo.\u00bfApoya a GoodKids MadCity Peace Book o cualquier otra iniciativa fuera de la polic\u00eda para invertir en la seguridad de los vecindarios Negros de Chicago?S\u00ed lo apoyo. Les dije que necesitan modificar algunos de los problemas del presupuesto, pero las ideas de lo que est\u00e1n hablando, s\u00ed. Fui la primera en trabajar con GoodKids MadCity. Presentamos el Proyecto 1919 en torno a los disturbios raciales. Los reun\u00ed a ellos y al Dr. [Timuel] Black en torno a esa iniciativa.\u00a0Adem\u00e1s de vigilar, [en] la intervenci\u00f3n contra la violencia, mi recomendaci\u00f3n es $300 millones por a\u00f1o para hacer cambios y ver los problemas sist\u00e9micos a largo plazo para realmente unir a las personas y las comunidades. Y por cierto, eso deber\u00eda tener un impacto en la vivienda, en el trabajo, en todo tipo de cosas.\u00bfEso significa aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto policial para que esto suceda?No creo que el presupuesto policial deba reducirse en este momento. Solo te dir\u00e9 eso. Porque, en primer lugar, es dif\u00edcil saber si tenemos suficientes polic\u00edas o no. Pero s\u00e9 que no est\u00e1n en los lugares donde deben estar en el momento adecuado. S\u00e9 que hay una desproporci\u00f3n. Yo lo veo. Veo que mi distrito policial, que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s de 600 agentes, ahora tiene menos de 200. Y, por cierto, el Distrito 19, que no tiene casi [tantos] delitos, tiene m\u00e1s que el m\u00edo. Entonces, si tuvi\u00e9ramos que redistribuirlo, \u00bftendr\u00edamos suficiente? Tal vez.\u00a0Creo que eso es algo que necesito echarle un vistazo. Pero lo que veo en este momento es que los lugares que m\u00e1s lo necesitan no lo tienen, y deber\u00edan tenerlo en esas \u00e1reas. Veo c\u00f3mo lo hacen en el norte. Veo cu\u00e1ntos polic\u00edas hay para mitigar las cosas antes de que sucedan, para poder hablar con la comunidad mientras est\u00e1n all\u00ed para tener realmente esa relaci\u00f3n. Creo que eso es necesario antes de que las cosas se pongan mal. Entonces, para m\u00ed, hay dos cosas importantes. Est\u00e1n las respuestas alternativas a la vigilancia, as\u00ed como la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia.\u00bfApoya Tratamiento No Trauma?Entonces se le llama todas estas cosas. As\u00ed que esos son los socorristas de salud mental, ese es el programa para el que obtuve dinero singularmente. Me asoci\u00e9 con la Concejal Rosanna Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez en eso, pero lo elev\u00e9 para d\u00e1rselo porque eso es lo que soy como l\u00edder.Lo apoy\u00e9 bajo Rahm cuando ning\u00fan otro concejal habl\u00f3 sobre recuperar eso. As\u00ed que estas no son cosas nuevas para m\u00ed. Son cosas que probablemente sean nuevas para el p\u00fablico, porque no me he dedicado a comercializar lo que hago, porque no lo hac\u00eda por eso. Estoy bien. No me importa qui\u00e9n recibe el cr\u00e9dito. S\u00f3lo tenemos que hacer esto. Necesitamos tener, ya sabes, socorristas de salud mental y el tratamiento que se deriva del trauma proviene de la reconstrucci\u00f3n de las cl\u00ednicas.La alcaldesa Lightfoot prometi\u00f3 una junta escolar electa, pero luego luch\u00f3 contra dicha junta. \u00bfApoyar\u00e1 una junta escolar electa? \u00bfY a qui\u00e9n pensar\u00eda en nombrar para el aspecto h\u00edbrido de la junta?No he pensado en a qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00eda. Pero los educadores son importantes. Ser\u00eda importante, ya sabes, encontrar personas que entiendan c\u00f3mo involucrar a los estudiantes desinteresados, porque eso es una gran parte. Adem\u00e1s, debemos llevar los oficios y la industria tecnol\u00f3gica a las escuelas. Y quiero dejar en claro que los programas de aprendices solo pueden acceder a ellos despu\u00e9s de graduarse, despu\u00e9s de cumplir 18 a\u00f1os, y generalmente est\u00e1n en los suburbios. Necesitan ser llevados a nuestras escuelas. As\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda alguien que realmente entienda la importancia de eso y de la industria tecnol\u00f3gica. Ciertamente quisiera personas que comprendan los impactos de la educaci\u00f3n en la comunidad de una manera muy profunda. Porque realmente, tenemos que traer m\u00e1s participaci\u00f3n o m\u00e1s programas extracurriculares.Idealmente creo que deber\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o. Es un poco grande y dif\u00edcil de manejar. Pero es lo que va a ser ahora mismo. Pero ciertamente me gusta la parte elegida.Durante d\u00e9cadas, el alcalde ha estado en desacuerdo con el sindicato de maestros y muchos maestros, personal y estudiantes de base que se quejan de la falta de recursos y otros problemas importantes dentro de las escuelas. \u00bfCu\u00e1l cree que es la desconexi\u00f3n? \u00bfY cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su pol\u00edtica para mejorar CPS, especialmente en las comunidades Negras y Latine?Tengo una relaci\u00f3n con la CTU. Tengo relaci\u00f3n con la mayor\u00eda de los sindicatos. Probablemente dir\u00eda que soy la segunda opci\u00f3n de todos, lo cual est\u00e1 bien, porque demuestra que tengo esas relaciones. Creo que si no apoyaran a Brandon [Johnson], me apoyar\u00edan a m\u00ed. Pero mi punto m\u00e1s importante es que tengo esa relaci\u00f3n con ellos. Y continuar\u00e9 teniendo una relaci\u00f3n en la que puedan tener discusiones honestas sobre lo que est\u00e1 pasando con nuestros hijes y lo que es mejor para nuestros hijes.\u00a0Algunas de las grandes cosas en t\u00e9rminos de educaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda un modelo co-curricular. Y como vengo de la educaci\u00f3n, uso esa lengua vern\u00e1cula, pero en realidad es la programaci\u00f3n extracurricular, para hacer una escuela completa. Creo que eso es realmente importante. Creo que perdemos usar esta oportunidad para hacer eso realmente. Porque tienes estos beb\u00e9s peque\u00f1os que, ya sabes, despu\u00e9s de la escuela, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no podemos involucrarlos todav\u00eda? Entonces, los estudiantes desconectados son uno de los mayores obst\u00e1culos que enfrentamos.\u00a0Definitivamente [har\u00eda] un mejor uso del distrito de parques. No hay ninguna raz\u00f3n por la cual los estudiantes de secundaria no deber\u00edan participar all\u00ed. Esa es una oportunidad perdida.\u00a0Creo que es muy importante asegurarse de que no solo se introduzca a nuestros hijos a STEM a una edad muy temprana, sino que continuemos con eso a trav\u00e9s del mercado laboral y traigamos todas estas empresas y todas estas universidades, como Northwestern, University of Illinois, DePaul, UofC. Tenemos algunas de las mejores escuelas del pa\u00eds, no nos aprovechamos de eso.Hist\u00f3ricamente, hemos visto grandes compa\u00f1ias de desarrollo desplazar y borrar comunidades Negras en Chicago. La gente en las \u00e1reas que rodean la pr\u00f3xima biblioteca de Obama, por ejemplo, ya est\u00e1n viviendo algunos elementos de desplazamiento. \u00bfC\u00f3mo va a crear pol\u00edticas para apoyar a los residentes negros a quienes los nuevos desarrollos les est\u00e1n costando mucho, como el Centro Presidencial Obama?Ya he mostrado c\u00f3mo lo he hecho. Entonces, hay cuatro desarrollos sorprendentes en esta ciudad, la biblioteca Obama, las yardas 78 de Lincoln y el Hospital Michael Reese, y ya terminamos el desarrollo de Michael Reese. Est\u00e1 siendo anunciado por el New York Times como uno de los desarrollos m\u00e1s equitativos del pa\u00eds. Pero nunca escuchaste ninguna protesta. Nunca escuchamos sobre el desplazamiento ni nada de eso, porque formamos un Comit\u00e9 Asesor de Michael Reese. Trajimos a la mesa a personas que se preocupan por la vivienda, que se preocupan por todas estas cosas, y terminamos con un compromiso de $25 millones para la educaci\u00f3n de las escuelas. Terminamos con un 20 por ciento de viviendas asequibles en el lugar, lo cual es inaudito. Terminamos con un compromiso del 60 por ciento con la diversidad, en su mayor\u00eda afroamericanos porque est\u00e1 en Bronzeville, le cambiamos el nombre: de Michael Reese a Bronzeville Lakefront.Muchos de sus donantes pertenecen a la \u00e9lite profesional Negra de Chicago. Not\u00e9 que su esposo aport\u00f3 $50,000 para su campa\u00f1a. Seg\u00fan Illinois Sunshine. \u00bfC\u00f3mo rinde cuentas a las personas que han contribuido a su campa\u00f1a? \u00bfQu\u00e9 les prometio?Nunca prometas nada a nadie. He recibido contribuciones en los \u00faltimos seis a\u00f1os y medio de diferentes tipos de personas de diferentes \u00e1mbitos de la vida, y no miro las donaciones de esa manera. En primer lugar, es ilegal. Y en segundo lugar, simplemente soy un tipo de persona diferente. S\u00e9 cu\u00e1l es mi estrella polar, s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 me met\u00ed en esto y s\u00e9 que no se trata de m\u00ed, ni de ning\u00fan beneficio personal o pol\u00edtico.Siempre me he concentrado en lo que es mejor para nuestra comunidad, y nuestra comunidad significa algo diferente para m\u00ed en t\u00e9rminos de la ciudad. Pero nuevamente, sigo pensando en mis antecedentes, ya sea en Evanston, Mississippi, todas esas cosas, cuando la gente habla de la Gran Migraci\u00f3n, yo viv\u00ed eso. Yo ten\u00eda un t\u00edo que tuvo que dejar el sur para ir a Nueva York, por miedo a que lo lincharan y cosas por el estilo. As\u00ed que es parte de lo que soy."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "El Concejal Roderick Sawyer (sexto distrito) no es ajeno a la pol\u00edtica de Chicago. Se ha desempe\u00f1ado en el Concejo Municipal desde 2011, cuando derrot\u00f3 a Freddrenna Lyle, quien fue nombrada concejal por el entonces alcalde Richard M. Daley en 1998.\u00a0Sawyer naci\u00f3 y se cri\u00f3, y a\u00fan reside, en Park Manor, uno de los vecindarios que representa en el Concejo Municipal, al igual que su padre. Al igual que Daley, Sawyer es hijo de un exalcalde de Chicago.\u00a0Tras la muerte de Harold Washington, Concejal Eugene Sawyer el padre de Sawyer, fue elegido por un grupo de concejales blancos para ser alcalde en vez de el aliado de Washington, Timothy Evans. Eugene Sawyer sirvi\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os hasta que fue derrotado por Daley en las elecciones para alcalde del 1989. Daley mantuvo el poder durante casi tres d\u00e9cadas, m\u00e1s que cualquier otro alcalde de Chicago. Sawyer explic\u00f3 que sigue los pasos de su padre no por legado familiar, sino como servidor p\u00fablico.\u00a0\u201cNo me postulo para alcalde por \u00e9l. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo\u201d, dijo.\u00a0Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a alcalde del 2023, Sawyer invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 5 de enero al restaurante Oooh Wee It Is, el cual es un negocio dirigido por personas Negras en Chatham conocido por su comida reconfortante sure\u00f1a.\u00a0Actualmente, Sawyer se desempe\u00f1a como presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Salud y Relaciones Humanas del Concejo Municipal. Adem\u00e1s, fue presidente del Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus y copresidente del Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0Dijo que su historial en el Concejo Municipal y el hecho de que se haya ganado el apoyo y la confianza de sus colegas en la c\u00e1mara prueban que est\u00e1 preparado para ser el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago.\u00a0\u201cHe presentado y se ha aprob\u00f3 legislaci\u00f3nes innovadoras en el Concejo Municipal, por lo que tengo una capacidad comprobada para hacer las cosas\u201d, dijo Sawyer.\u00a0Durante su mandato en el Concejo Municipal, ha defendido temas como la ordenanza Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) que estableci\u00f3 una junta civil electa de residentes de Chicago para supervisar el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Chicago (CPD), la lucha por un salario m\u00ednimo de $15, el impulso para una junta escolar representativa electa y la ordenanza de GoodKids Madcity\u2019s Peace Book.Tambi\u00e9n vot\u00f3 a favor de medidas impopulares, incluyendo el presupuesto del 2011 de Emanuel, que se aprob\u00f3 por unanimidad y cerr\u00f3 seis de las 12 instalaciones de salud mental de la ciudad, y una medida del 2017 para adquirir una propiedad en West Garfield Park para una academia de polic\u00eda, que se aprob\u00f3 48 a 1.Durante nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, Sawyer habl\u00f3 sobre sus planes para abordar la violencia, la salud mental, la juventud, la vivienda asequible, las reparaciones para los habitantes Negros de Chicago y m\u00e1s.\u00a0No est\u00e1 llamando a aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto del CPD. En cambio, de acuerdo con su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, quiere reclutar m\u00e1s polic\u00edas, reparar el sistema de respuesta de emergencia de la ciudad, mejorar el bienestar de los oficiales, invertir en capacitaci\u00f3n policial integral y m\u00e1s. Adem\u00e1s, apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma, quiere abordar las causas profundas de la violencia y llama a revitalizar los vecindarios que han sufrido desinversi\u00f3n durante d\u00e9cadas.Como concejal, su vot\u00f3 estaba alineado con el del alcalde Rahm Emanuel el 100 por ciento del tiempo desde abril del 2017 hasta noviembre del 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Sawyer como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE:\u00a0 \u00bfC\u00f3mo impact\u00f3 y molde\u00f3 el crecer en Park Manor su pol\u00edtica?Concejal Roderick Sawyer: Crecer en Park Manor y todav\u00eda seguir viviendo aqu\u00ed habla muy bien del vecindario y la gente de aqu\u00ed. Cuando era ni\u00f1o, lo vi en su mejor momento. He visto a la comunidad de Park Manor luchar, y pasar por tiempos dif\u00edciles. Nunca cambi\u00f3 mi decision de querer quedarme aqu\u00ed y tratar de mejorar lo que hay aqu\u00ed.Soy muy firme sobre de d\u00f3nde vengo. Paso una cantidad excesiva de tiempo en mi vecindario porque siento mucho por la gente de aqu\u00ed. Ellos me formaron en lo que ahora soy. Entonces, como abogado, como persona de negocios y como residente, es abrumador el amor que recibo de mis vecinos de Park Manor, mis vecinos de Chatham, porque todos hemos superado esa lucha. Todos \u00e9ramos ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os juntos, traviesos, jug\u00e1bamos en los callejones y and\u00e1bamos en bicicleta por la zona. As\u00ed que para m\u00ed quedarme aqu\u00ed y elegir estar aqu\u00ed no es un testamento para m\u00ed, pero es un testamento para los que me rodean. Eso es extremadamente importante.Eres hijo del segundo alcalde Negro de Chicago, Eugene Sawyer.S\u00ed.Cuando el Concejo Municipal estaba seleccionando un sucesor despu\u00e9s del fallecimiento de Harold Washington, exist\u00eda la preocupaci\u00f3n de que nombrar a su padre para el puesto significar\u00eda un regreso a las pol\u00edticas anteriores. Adem\u00e1s, la mayor parte del apoyo que recibi\u00f3 de la c\u00e1mara provino de concejales blancos que obstru\u00edan al entonces alcalde Harold Washington y su agenda. Tambi\u00e9n hubo algunas acusaciones de algunos en la comunidad que acusaron a su padre de venderse a pol\u00edticos blancos.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ingreso a la contienda? \u00bfEs para seguir los pasos de su padre? \u00bfQu\u00e9 aprendio de su padre sobre el servicio p\u00fablico?Bueno, hagamos algunas correcciones. Primero, mi padre fue elegido porque era el mejor candidato para ese puesto. Fue un momento problem\u00e1tico despu\u00e9s de la muerte de nuestro amigo Harold Washington.Mi padre fue presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Reglas y presidente pro tempore. Eso significaba que \u00e9l dirig\u00eda el Comit\u00e9 de Reglas, y cuando Harold sali\u00f3, asumi\u00f3 el mando. Esa fue una enorme cantidad de responsabilidad dada a mi padre. Nadie ha ocupado nunca dos presidencias de comit\u00e9 al mismo tiempo adem\u00e1s de \u00e9l. As\u00ed que lo doy como testamento de confianza del alcalde a mi padre. El alcalde sab\u00eda que el trabajo se iba a hacer. Adem\u00e1s, cuando muri\u00f3 Harold, mi padre aprob\u00f3 todas las iniciativas que Harold trat\u00f3 de aprobar y no pudo debido a su prematura muerte. Incluso cosas que iban en contra de sus propios intereses personales.Mi padre era devoto de Harold Washington. As\u00ed que toda esa charla era una tonter\u00eda acerca de que \u00e9l estaba en deuda con los intereses de los blancos. Mi padre era un orgulloso hombre Negro de este vecindario [Park Manor] y Greensboro, Alabama. Una persona que estuvo all\u00ed protegiendo la casa de Martin Luther King mientras estaba en el estado de Alabama.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que todo ese ruido que hac\u00eda la gente en ese entonces era muy preocupante. Fue desalentador porque los intereses de mi padre eran sus residentes, la ciudad, Chicago y el Distrito 6.\u00a0Sin embargo, para responder a su \u00faltima pregunta, mi padre me ense\u00f1\u00f3 mucho sobre lo importante que es ser un buen administrador de su comunidad y lo importante que es el servicio p\u00fablico. Entonces en ese sentido, si, estoy siguiendo los pasos de mi padre, no como alcalde sino como servidor p\u00fablico aqu\u00ed en un \u00e1rea donde nac\u00ed y crec\u00ed, y por eso y lo que vi de \u00e9l, c\u00f3mo la gente lo ten\u00eda en alto estima porque ayudaba a los que estaban en este barrio. As\u00ed que quer\u00eda continuar ese mismo tipo de servicio. No me postulo para alcalde por mi padre. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo.Le\u00ed que cree que el crimen es el problema m\u00e1s importante de nuestra ciudad. Sin embargo, si es elegido, dijo que primero despedir\u00eda al superintendente de polic\u00eda de CPD. David Marr\u00f3n. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 o por qu\u00e9 no?Creo que nuestro mayor problema es la ansiedad por el crimen. Eso significa que no importa d\u00f3nde vivas en la ciudad. Si sales, sientes que existe la posibilidad de que te pase algo. Esa es la ansiedad, y eso tiene un costo econ\u00f3mico.\u00a0Los que tienen medios y recursos no salen porque sienten esa ansiedad. Eso significa que no gastan dinero en restaurantes, bares, teatros, gimnasios, cervecer\u00edas, clubs de salud y todas las cosas en las que esperar\u00edamos que gastaran dinero [en].Cuando vi a David Brown en Dallas , me anim\u00f3. Pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda un buen superintendente porque apoyaba a sus polic\u00edas en Dallas. Vi que era duro con el crimen y un tipo con fuerza. Desafortunadamente, no estamos recibiendo a ese mismo tipo aqu\u00ed ahora. Este no es el mismo David Brown.Si fuera elegido, aprovechar\u00eda esa oportunidad para usar la plataforma en la que trabaj\u00e9 durante siete a\u00f1os, Empowering Communities for Public Safety, o ECPS [ordenanza].Me enorgullece decir que fui el patrocinador principal de la ordenanza ECPS y ayud\u00e9 a llevarla a cabo. Entonces, elegiremos miembros de la comunidad para restablecer la confianza entre la comunidad y la polic\u00eda y, cuando lo hagamos, la gente se sentir\u00e1 m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda hablando con la polic\u00eda. Eso significa que le dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a la polic\u00eda, lo que significa que podemos resolver m\u00e1s cr\u00edmenes, as\u00ed es como funciona. Es un efecto domin\u00f3.Soy un gran defensor de eso. Tambi\u00e9n usar\u00e9 esa misma plataforma para elegir un superintendente que tenga el respeto del departamento de polic\u00eda, de las bases, que haya pasado por el sistema, que comprenda lo que necesitamos para que los oficiales se concentren en su trabajo, lo cual es detener a la gente mala y atarlos para que tengan un juicio.\u00bfUsted piensa en aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto de CPD? \u00bfC\u00f3mo piensa que deber\u00eda asignarse el presupuesto policial?Debemos tener los recursos necesarios para responder a las llamadas de servicio. La Ciudad de Chicago est\u00e1 en un negocio de servicios. Eso es especialmente cierto para la polic\u00eda. La polic\u00eda es un servicio. Son servidores p\u00fablicos; te sirven y sirven a todos aqu\u00ed.Entonces, si no tenemos suficientes oficiales para responder a las llamadas y toma m\u00e1s de una hora responder a las llamadas, eso es un problema. Eso est\u00e1 aumentando esa misma ansiedad de la que habl\u00e9. As\u00ed que ahora me han robado, llamo a la polic\u00eda y no aparece nadie. Eso se siente como si nadie me estuviera protegiendo. Esa es esa ansiedad continua. As\u00ed que no me har\u00e1 sentir mejor si nadie aparece.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, esto es lo que estamos hablando de hacer para las llamadas no violentas, digamos, desafortunadamente, te robaron, pero est\u00e1s bien. No te hicieron da\u00f1o. Se llevaron tu billetera, bolso o auto. Puede llamar al 9-1-1, y podemos enviar a alguien para obtener un informe de usted, un oficial uniformado. Puede ser un oficial retirado que sabe c\u00f3mo tomar el informe y obtener descripciones de usted y transmitir esa informaci\u00f3n a aquellos en la calle que, con suerte, pueden detener a ese sospechoso o delincuente y llevarlos a juicio.\u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 en seguridad? Seg\u00fan lo que dijo, \u00bfeso significa que contratar\u00eda m\u00e1s polic\u00edas?Contratar\u00eda polic\u00edas cuando sea apropiado. Me asegurar\u00eda de que superemos el nivel de jubilaciones y deserciones. La gente se est\u00e1 yendo. Y aseg\u00farese de que no sea un enfoque de uno u otro. Creo en dotar a los oficiales del nivel adecuado. Tal vez sean oficiales jubilados o civiles que necesitamos contratar para conseguir a esos oficiales que necesitamos para salir a la calle.\u00a0Es posible que solo necesitemos reasignar algunas posiciones. Pero eso no significa que no debamos invertir en servicios de salud mental, oportunidades laborales, capacitaci\u00f3n laboral, abuso de drogas y sustancias, o adicci\u00f3n. No, es un enfoque de ambos y. Tenemos que invertir en todas esas cosas.\u00bfHay otras formas fuera de la polic\u00eda en las que invertir\u00eda en seguridad?Nuevamente, invertir en la respuesta del tratamiento de los servicios de salud mental para que, tal vez, alguien pueda reducir la intensidad de una situaci\u00f3n en lugar de arrestar a alguien. Podemos proporcionar servicios de adicci\u00f3n a las drogas a aquellos que son dependientes a ellas. Tenemos que invertir en ambas cosas. No es de hacer esto y no hacer aquello. Se deben hacer ambas cosas.En el 2020, propuso eliminar CPD de CPS en el Concejo Municipal. \u00bfHa cambiado su opini\u00f3n acerca de eso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?Bueno, d\u00e9jame decir esto. Mi objetivo no era sacar a los polic\u00edas de las escuelas. Quer\u00eda iniciar una conversaci\u00f3n sobre lo que hacen los oficiales de polic\u00eda en ciertas escuelas y c\u00f3mo a veces tiene un efecto negativo en sus estudiantes. Me alegro de que haya funcionado como lo hizo porque las escuelas ahora toman una decisi\u00f3n. Pueden elegir si quieren oficiales en su escuela o no quieren oficiales, y es una elecci\u00f3n del LSC [Consejo Escolar Local] de la escuela. Estoy muy contento con la forma en que sali\u00f3.\u00a0La gente simplemente malinterpret\u00f3 mi objetivo. Mi objetivo era provocar una discusi\u00f3n, lo cual sucedi\u00f3. A veces tienes que hacer cosas audaces, y es por eso que necesitas un l\u00edder que no tenga miedo de tomar una decisi\u00f3n audaz. No tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n precipitada; Tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n audaz.\u00a0Terminamos ahorrando algo de dinero. Ahorramos varios millones de d\u00f3lares para aquellas escuelas que eligieron no tener oficiales en su escuela y aquellas que mantuvieron oficiales en escuelas que estaban contentas con sus oficiales. Empoder\u00f3 a los representantes del LSC y a otros a tomar decisiones sobre el futuro de sus escuelas, lo cual me alegro mucho de poder haber hecho.Muchos de sus colegas votaron a favor de la propuesta del alcalde Lightfoot de extender y ampliar el toque de queda para los j\u00f3venes en toda la ciudad a pesar de que cr\u00edticos decian que afectar\u00eda desproporcionadamente a los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latine. Fue uno de los concejales negros que vot\u00f3 en contra. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS? \u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda estos planes?Est\u00e1bamos pensando en c\u00f3mo mantenerlos alejados, en lugar de relacionarnos con ellos y tenerlos en un espacio seguro donde puedan divertirse, y cuando llegue el momento de irse a casa, se ir\u00e1n a casa. Est\u00e1n cansados \u200b\u200by se la pasaron bien. Les proporcionamos algo bueno y los organizadores ganaron un poco de dinero. As\u00ed es como gan\u00e9 dinero cuando era ni\u00f1o. Hice fiestas. Yo era DJ, organizaba fiestas y estaba involucrado en eso.\u00a0As\u00ed que no veo eso en la juventud en este momento. Por eso est\u00e1n tan frustrados que no tienen d\u00f3nde desahogarse. Cuando eres joven, tienes mucha energ\u00eda reprimida que necesitas liberar, as\u00ed que eso es bailar y actuar chistoso por un momento. Necesit\u00e1bamos proporcionarles eso. Entonces se frustran y se van a comportar mal, y eso es lo que sucedi\u00f3 y eso es un fracaso de nuestra parte.Como concejal, usted vot\u00f3 para cerrar la mitad de las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental de la ciudad durante la administraci\u00f3n del entonces alcalde Rahm Emanuel. Sin embargo, en el sitio de web de su campa\u00f1a, dijo que apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma. Si apoya Tratamiento No Trauma, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 vot\u00f3 para cerrar esas cl\u00ednicas de salud mental?Cuando me eligieron, entr\u00e9 como presidente del comit\u00e9 de salud y relaciones humanas, y lo primero que hice fue visitar los centros de salud mental restantes. Estaban vac\u00edos.\u00a0\u00a0Apenas hab\u00eda pacientes de ning\u00fan nivel. Los visit\u00e9 a todos. Dijeron que nunca los visit\u00f3 ning\u00fan consejal. Los he visitado todos. Lo primero que hice fue mirarlos todos y ver cu\u00e1les eran los recursos y si estaban ocupados. Me pregunte, \u00bfNecesit\u00e1bamos proporcionar m\u00e1s recursos?Cuando hice esa votaci\u00f3n sobre los centros de salud mental, un par de a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s escrib\u00ed un art\u00edculo, y dije que si pod\u00eda retirar un voto, el \u00fanico voto que retirar\u00eda era el cierre del servicio de salud mental [las cl\u00ednicas]. Deber\u00edamos haber tomado m\u00e1s tiempo antes de hacer esa decisi\u00f3n.No creo que no deber\u00edan de ver sido cerradas. Lo que deber\u00edamos haber hecho es enfocarnos un poco m\u00e1s y averiguar por qu\u00e9 la administraci\u00f3n quer\u00eda que se cerraran las clinicas. Nosotros no hicimos eso; era una medida de ahorro de dinero para reducir costos. Mis ojos se abrieron cuando visit\u00e9 las clinicas y me di cuenta de que no las est\u00e1bamos usando. No las anunciamos ni las promocionamos. No se sab\u00eda que exist\u00edan y que la gente pod\u00eda ir all\u00ed gratis.\u00a0Me di cuenta de que no aceptaban ni\u00f1es. Gracias a nuestra defensa, ahora est\u00e1n dando cuidado a ni\u00f1es. Est\u00e1n ampliando sus horarios y est\u00e1n empezando a promocionar las clinicas. As\u00ed que tuve un papel para garantizar que la administraci\u00f3n se diera cuenta de un problema relacionado con nuestro servicio de salud mental.Como sabe, los votantes de su distrito apoyaron abrumadoramente el refer\u00e9ndum Tratamiento, No Trauma durante en las votaciones al mitad del mandato del 2022. Si es elegido, \u00bfc\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda los planes espec\u00edficos bajo la ordenanza Tratamiento No Trauma?Tenemos fondos disponibles para Tratamiento No Trauma. El Departamento de Salud tiene un presupuesto s\u00f3lido. Podemos financiar Tratamiento No Trauma, sin problemas. Debido a que ese dinero est\u00e1 destinado a ciertas cosas, podemos tener ese dinero disponible para cosas como servicios de salud mental. Podemos usar el dinero que est\u00e1 disponible ahora.\u00a0No es tanto un problema de financiaci\u00f3n. Es un problema de intencionalidad. \u00bfLa gente quiere que esto suceda? No veo por qu\u00e9 no lo quicieran. Puede salvar la vida de alguien brind\u00e1ndole servicios de salud mental en lugar de traer a un oficial de polic\u00eda.\u00a0Un oficial de polic\u00eda est\u00e1 entrenado para hacer una determinada cosa. Los oficiales de polic\u00eda est\u00e1n capacitados para detener y arrestar. Ese es su trabajo. Es necesario en ciertos casos: cuando alguien te est\u00e1 robando, quieres a la polic\u00eda. Cuando alguien tiene un problema de salud mental, no quieres a la polic\u00eda. Quieres un experto en salud mental. Quiere a alguien que pueda decirle \"c\u00e1lmese\" o dirigirlo a los servicios adecuados. Necesita ese tipo de voz que te tranquiliza y que pueda ayudarte.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?Estamos a punto de tener una junta escolar representativa electa que ser\u00e1 aut\u00f3noma y trabajar\u00e1 de manera independiente. Mientras tanto, me asegurar\u00e9 de que las escuelas tengan todos los recursos necesarios para que tengan \u00e9xito. Soy un gran defensor de las escuelas del vecindario.\u00a0\u00a0Quiero asegurarme de que obtengamos todos los recursos posibles para la mayor\u00eda de los estudiantes porque eso es lo importante. El futuro de nuestra ciudad son nuestros ni\u00f1es. Quiero asegurarme de que todo lo que hagamos, en lo que se refiere a las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago, est\u00e9 en la l\u00ednea correcta, sin cometer ninguna locura. He trabajado con CTU [Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago] en el pasado y continuar\u00e9 trabajando con CTU en el futuro. Simplemente no estoy en deuda con CTU. No voy a dejarme dictar por nadie.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00e1 los planes para invertir en las escuelas del vecindario?He estado involucrado por mucho tiempo y tambi\u00e9n he sido presidente de LSC durante 12 a\u00f1os. Siempre he sido de la opini\u00f3n de que tenemos que manejar bien las finanzas de las escuelas. El dinero gastado en ciertas cosas rid\u00edculas a veces tiene que ser mirado y eliminado. Por lo tanto, desea asegurarme de que las escuelas puedan operar de manera independiente, dentro de los l\u00edmites de su presupuesto basado en la f\u00f3rmula del estudiante. Eso necesita ser cambiado, pero eso es parte de invertir en las escuelas. Creo que eso es parte de una discusi\u00f3n m\u00e1s larga que se tiene que hacer con el estado. Voy a sumergirme en ese tipo de cosas. Porque cuando hablo de restablecer Chicago, estos son los tipos de cosas que debemos restablecer.\u00bfA qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00e1 para la junta h\u00edbrida?Me gustar\u00eda una mezcla de educadores, personas de la comunidad y personas interesadas en el futuro de nuestros hijes. No creo que tenga una medida establecida probada y verdadera de a qui\u00e9n quiero nombrar en cuanto a personas. A\u00fan as\u00ed, deseo que las personas en la industria financiera entiendan c\u00f3mo operar los presupuestos y se adhieran a ellos. Quiere educadores, para que tengamos un plan adecuado para todes los estudiantes, no solo para los de alto rendimiento.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiero personas que puedan involucrar a los padres y otros miembros del comit\u00e9 para que se involucren en lo que sucede en las escuelas. Las escuelas deben estar abiertas todo el d\u00eda y la noche, con recursos y programas para los estudiantes y, si es necesario, para los padres. A veces los padres necesitan alguna formaci\u00f3n o educaci\u00f3n adicional. As\u00ed que quiero que todo eso suceda, y que la escuela sea el centro de ese vecindario con todos esos recursos en un solo lugar.Usted mencion\u00f3 que ha trabajado con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago. \u00bfHay alg\u00fan plan o propuesta espec\u00edfica que tenga para financiar las escuelas? Estuve mirando su sitio de web y no estaba muy claro c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan esas pol\u00edticas.Los fondos provienen de una variedad de fuentes: algunos provienen de los impuestos a la propiedad, algunos de nuestro gobierno estatal y federal, algunos de la ciudad de Chicago. Queremos asegurarnos de analizar todas esas fuentes de financiaci\u00f3n y ver c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n funcionando.Seguimos aumentando la financiaci\u00f3n escolar, aunque el n\u00famero de matr\u00edculas sigue bajando, algo no tiene sentido. Una vez que pueda llegar all\u00ed, echarle un vistazo a las fuentes de fondos y sumergirme en \u00e9l, veremos cu\u00e1l es el problema. \u00bfEs muy pesado al principio? \u00bfTiene CPS demasiadas propiedades inmobiliarias que no est\u00e1n funcionando? \u00bfSon cuestiones presupuestarias? \u00bfTenemos demasiados directores adjuntos y comisionados adjuntos en la oficina principal y necesitamos m\u00e1s personas en primera l\u00ednea ense\u00f1ando a nuestros hijes?S\u00e9 que muchas escuelas han eliminado los AP [subdirectores]. Pero, por ejemplo, eso no deber\u00eda pasar. Quitamos ayudantes en k\u00ednder y primer grado, donde ahora tienes una maestra sola con 35 ni\u00f1es de cinco a\u00f1os. No es un m\u00e9todo de apoyo, y no mejorar\u00e1 la educaci\u00f3n.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda investigar estas cosas y asegurarme de que estamos haciendo lo correcto para nuestros estudiantes, no necesariamente para el sindicato [CTU] o el personal de la oficina principal. Tenemos que concentrarnos en lo que es importante, y son esos ni\u00f1es.Nuestros lectores estan curiosos acerca de los impuestos. Entonces, \u00bflo que est\u00e1 proponiendo hacer requerir\u00eda aumentar los impuestos de la propiedad?No, ese ser\u00eda el \u00faltimo recurso. Dir\u00e9 que muchos candidatos usan esto como un punto de venta para decir \"no impuestos\" o \"nunca impuestos\". Deben de tener una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable. Una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable, por ejemplo, en lo que se refiere a los impuestos de bienes y ra\u00edces, son pasos peque\u00f1os e incrementales para mejorar los impuestos.\u00a0Si nuestro IPC [\u00edndice de precios al consumidor] sube, deber\u00edamos tener un peque\u00f1o aumento en los impuestos a la propiedad para reflejar el aumento en el costo de los bienes y servicios. Entonces, si eso sucede, debemos hacer ese cambio incremental en lugar de lo que hemos estado haciendo ahora, diciendo que todo est\u00e1 bien. \u201cNo, no necesitamos aumentar los impuestos nunca, nunca, nunca hasta despu\u00e9s de una elecci\u00f3n de, 'oh, tenemos que aumentar los impuestos'. Eso es irresponsable, y est\u00e1 mal. Deber\u00edamos buscar pol\u00edticas fiscales m\u00e1s responsables, algo que la gente ni siquiera notar\u00e1 un aumento del uno al dos por ciento en sus impuestos de vez en cuando.Si el IPC baja, entonces podemos buscar descuentos y tal vez reembolsos para aquellos que pagan impuestos. Pero nuevamente, solo si el panorama financiero parece estar justificado, no solo porque a la gente le gusta escucharlo y no lo hacemos. Eso es lo que nos meti\u00f3 en el problema en primer lugar de no pagar nuestras obligaciones de pensi\u00f3n y no aumentar los impuestos para hacer cosas necesarias, en lugar de hacer cosas populares.Chicago es una ciudad llena de barrios vibrantes. Pero se est\u00e1 volviendo dif\u00edcil para muchas personas permanecer en la ciudad. Hay nuevos desarrollos que se avecinan en el centro de los barrios. Me refiero espec\u00edficamente al proyecto de Bally\u2019s casino. Usted vot\u00f3 a favor de eso. Entonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para ayudar a los propietarios e inquilinos del desplazamiento o a las personas sin hogar?Vot\u00e9 a favor de eso. Uno, tenemos un presupuesto muy s\u00f3lido en este momento para personas sin hogar. El problema es que solo gastamos alrededor del 5 por ciento del dinero. Tenemos mucho dinero esperando para gastarlo en iniciativas para personas sin hogar. A veces estamos mirando en la direcci\u00f3n equivocada. No quiero gastar dinero que beneficiar\u00e1 a los desarrolladores m\u00e1s de lo que beneficia a las personas sin hogar. Ah\u00ed es donde realmente tengo un problema, y \u200b\u200blo mantengo.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, cuando la gente habla de cosas como Bring Chicago Home, me encanta la intenci\u00f3n. Pero cuando empiezas analizar con mas cuidado, te das cuenta que los desarrolladores tender\u00edan a beneficiarse m\u00e1s que las personas sin hogar. Podemos ayudar a las personas sin hogar ahora mismo. Casi podemos erradicar la falta de vivienda excepto por un par de problemas.\u00a0Tenemos dinero para albergar a las personas que contamos. La mayor\u00eda de ellos no quieren entrar en los tipos de estructuras que estamos acostumbrados a construir. Prefieren estar en esa comunidad en la que est\u00e1n a la salida de Roosevelt Road en la autopista porque al menos saben que se van a cuidar unos a otros. Ah\u00ed es donde est\u00e1 su comunidad.\u00a0Puede que no lo entendamos. He hablado con suficientes personas sin hogar para saber que a veces la ayuda que buscan no es la ayuda que estamos acostumbrados a proporcionar. Si estamos diciendo, puedo cuidarte y ponerte en un refugio. No quieren estar en un refugio. Saben que les han robado, violado y asaltado en los albergues, tienen una mala experiencia en los albergues, no quieren volver.\u00a0Hablemos de brindarles recursos, tratamiento, oportunidad, empleo y capacitaci\u00f3n, para llevarlos a un espacio donde podamos conseguirles una casa o un apartamento de inicio, y luego puedan continuar recibiendo el tratamiento o la experiencia laboral para ganar dinero. Eso es lo que miro. Busco soluciones m\u00e1s org\u00e1nicas, no solo decir, oye, vamos a dejarlas en un albergue y hemos cumplido con nuestra parte. Eso no es suficiente.Recuerdo estar en una reuni\u00f3n en la que estaba con otros funcionarios electos Negros. En la reuni\u00f3n, explic\u00f3 lo desafiante que es para usted y sus colegas representar partes de Englewood porque tiene muchas propiedades vacantes y abandonadas. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus planes para revitalizar vecindarios, como Englewood, con muchas \u00e1reas/propiedades vacantes?Lo que no hacemos es dar a nuestros desarrolladores Negros y todos los desarrolladores que son minor\u00edas recursos y oportunidades para desarrollar en sus vecindarios. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, lo que sea. Tenemos \u00e1reas abandonadas por toda la ciudad y podr\u00edamos beneficiarnos de la llegada de desarrolladores. Ning\u00fan desarrollador del centro va a venir aqu\u00ed y te dir\u00e1 lo mismo. Un desarrollador me dijo que si construyo en Fulton Market, puedo obtener cierta cantidad por unidad que alquile o venda. Y si construyo en los otros vecindarios, no puede obtener tanto. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es mi incentivo para venir aqu\u00ed a construir?\u00a0Tenemos constructores afroamericanos que construir\u00e1n. Tendr\u00edamos que relajar algunos de los problemas sindicales y otros para darles una ventaja para hacer desarrollos de calidad aqu\u00ed en los lados sur y oeste.\u00a0Necesitamos comenzar a hacer eso y lograr que estos desarrolladores se involucren para que ya no puedan ser peque\u00f1os desarrolladores. Tendr\u00e1n una meta y una mentalidad para negociar m\u00e1s en un vecindario que los ayud\u00f3 a criarse en lugar de simplemente ir al centro.Pueden construir una cuadra a la vez. Tal vez dos o tres desarrolladores, luego construyan la cuadra completa y luego podemos hacer otra cuadra. Porque literalmente tengo cuadras de terreno bald\u00edo en esta peque\u00f1a \u00e1rea de Englewood que tengo. S\u00e9 que mis colegas tienen extensiones de tierra a\u00fan m\u00e1s grandes que podr\u00edan desarrollarse y venderse o alquilarse, o en cualquier caso, a propietarios que est\u00e1n trabajando, pero necesitan ayuda para llegar a fin de mes.\u00a0Podemos conseguirles esa vivienda asequible y de calidad aqu\u00ed. Cerca del tren. Si est\u00e1n trabajando en el centro de la ciudad, pueden subirse al tren y en 15 minutos llegar al trabajo o la escuela o donde tengan que estar. Necesitamos comenzar a ver eso en lugar de solo concentrarnos en el centro de la ciudad. Sin embargo, s\u00e9 lo importante que es el centro de la ciudad para nosotros. Pero no lo es todo.Los habitantes Negros de Chicago se han ido de la ciudad desde la d\u00e9cada del 2000 por muchas razones. Pero me pregunto, qu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas o planes espec\u00edficos promulgar\u00e1 su administraci\u00f3n para que no perdamos m\u00e1s habitantes Negros de Chicago.Debemos tener un plan de mercadotecnia para traer a la gente de regreso a Chicago. Literalmente deber\u00eda ser: traer a los habitantes de Chicago de vuelta a casa. Necesitamos comprometernos con la gente de mercadotecnia, preferiblemente con personas Negras. Chicago es una gran ciudad. Chicago tiene muchas comodidades. Es una ciudad de clase mundial. Podemos eliminar las cosas problem\u00e1ticas y hacerlas vibrantes. No hay otra ciudad mejor.\u00a0Necesitamos promover eso y hacer una inversi\u00f3n. A veces hay que invertir para recuperar algo. No me gusta gastar dinero por gastar dinero; los sorteos y trucos no son lo mio. As\u00ed que vamos a hacer verdaderas inversiones en Chicago, invertir en el futuro de Chicago, asegur\u00e1ndonos de que las personas sepan lo grandiosa que es Chicago y las comodidades que podemos brindarles.\u00a0Englewood se puede restaurar a gran gloria. Es intencional de quien est\u00e1 a la cabeza, encabezando eso, y tiene ese sentido de visi\u00f3n para decir que podemos hacer esto aqu\u00ed en Englewood, podemos hacer esto en East Garfield Park, podemos hacer esto en Lawndale. Podemos hacer esto y todas estas otras \u00e1reas desafiantes, como Pilsen y La Villita. Podemos hacerlo en \u00e1reas que han sido marginadas en el pasado. Se necesita que el l\u00edder en la cima diga, esto es lo que vamos a hacer, y as\u00ed es como lo haremos.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiamos eso?Hay una variedad de formas de financiarlo. Hay financiaci\u00f3n de bonos. Hay muchos mecanismos de financiaci\u00f3n diferentes, especialmente en las zonas deterioradas. Trabajaremos con nuestros socios en el gobierno estatal y federal. Puede que tengamos que emitir bonos. Tuvimos que emitir algo de deuda para hacer algunas de las cosas y ponerlas en marcha. Hay una variedad de formas. No estamos sin dinero. A veces luchamos porque tomamos malas decisiones, y necesitamos tomar menos malas decisiones y m\u00e1s decisiones conservadoras desde el punto de vista financiero que tengan sentido. Haces inversiones; no gastas dinero.Hablando de invertir en Black Chicago y mantener a los Negros aqu\u00ed, \u00bfdeber\u00edan las reparaciones estar al frente como prioridad en el 2023?Siento que si deber\u00eda ser asi. He estado tratando de impulsar las reparaciones durante a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de conocer m\u00e1s al respecto, lo present\u00e9 al Concejo Municipal. El alcalde me dijo: \u201cYo no voy a hacer nada sobre las reparaciones; eso no es m\u00e1s que un truco de Willie Wilson\u201d.El Sr. Wilson nos estaba ayudando financieramente con la difusi\u00f3n de las reparaciones. Tambi\u00e9n estaba aprendiendo sobre las reparaciones. Est\u00e1bamos haciendo lo que pod\u00edamos para mostrar lo importante es la reparaci\u00f3n. He hablado con epidemi\u00f3logos y epigenetistas.Los problemas que tenemos actualmente se remontan a que estabamos esclavizados y atravesamos la era de Jim Crow, y la discriminacion basado en los vecindarios, y todas las cosas por las que hemos pasado durante d\u00e9cadas y d\u00e9cadas, y eso nos hace reaccionar de cierta manera. Necesitamos sumergirnos en eso y descubrir cu\u00e1l es ese problema, y \u200b\u200buna vez que lo hagamos, todos se beneficiar\u00e1n. As\u00ed que no estoy tan interesado en otra cosa que no sean los 40 acres y el dinero. Eso es m\u00e1s una conversaci\u00f3n federal. Lo m\u00edo son m\u00e1s las brechas de salud, las brechas educativas y cosas as\u00ed que son importantes, y hay una raz\u00f3n para ello. Hay una raz\u00f3n para eso, y no creo que lo hayamos profundizado lo suficiente. Hay una palabra para eso. La alcalde [Lightfoot] no usar\u00eda la palabra reparaciones. Si le preguntas, no dir\u00eda reparaciones.\u00bfSu plan inicial era solo obtener una comisi\u00f3n de personas?Ya hemos estudiado bastante. No se trataba de un estudio. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n de reparaciones igual a Calles y Saneamiento y al Departamento de Transporte. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n a nivel ejecutivo sobre reparaciones para discutir la reparaci\u00f3n que necesitamos como descendientes de africanos esclavizados.\u00a0\u00a0No pude obtener apoyo. Ni siquiera pude obtener el apoyo de la gente Negra. Fue dif\u00edcil porque la gente no lo entend\u00eda. Recuerdo que algunos de mis colegas asistieron a un par de reuniones porque ten\u00eda que tener reuniones fuera del sitio y no pude obtener una reuni\u00f3n en el consejo.\u00a0Bajo mi administraci\u00f3n, las reparaciones estar\u00e1n a primera fila. Tenemos que hablar de eso. Tenemos que hacerlo. Tenemos que entender, y quiero que m\u00e1s gente entienda. Quiero que los blancos y todos lo entiendan porque es vital para todos.Me di cuenta de que no necesariamente tiene patrocinios a gran escala como sus otros oponentes en la carrera.No, porque no estoy en deuda con nadie en esta carrera.Entonces, \u00bfa qui\u00e9n le rindes cuentas?Soy responsable ante los ciudadanos de la ciudad de Chicago. Estas son las personas que tengo en alta estima y me siento responsable ante los residentes cotidianos, las personas que van a trabajar todos los d\u00edas, las personas desempleadas, las personas que luchan y las personas que les va bien. Represento a los verdaderos habitantes de Chicago, aquellos que quieren buenas escuelas, distritos comerciales vibrantes, calles seguras y disfrutar de sus vecindarios y volver a casa seguros. Estas son las personas que represento. Estas son las personas que me apoyan.Tuve que repasar algunos art\u00edculos y entrevistas anteriores para preparar mis preguntas de hoy porque su sitio web al momento de esta entrevista todavia no tiene una plataforma de pol\u00edticas escrita. \u00bfC\u00f3mo pueden los votantes de Chicago confiar en usted como legislador y responsabilizarlo por sus promesas de campa\u00f1a?He sido tan prodigioso en asuntos de pol\u00edtica como cualquier concejal del Concejo Municipal. Desde la lucha contra la privatizaci\u00f3n hasta la reforma policial y las iniciativas comerciales, he demostrado mis habilidades para hacer que las cosas avancen y cumplirlasa.\u00a0La junta escolar representativa electa, estuvimos all\u00ed; paz laboral en los aeropuertos y cuidado de ni\u00f1es. Estas son cosas en las que siempre tuve al frente, liderando, no solo votando por ello, liderando, abogando por obtener votos, azotando votos y aprob\u00e1ndolo.\u00a0Mi historia habla por s\u00ed misma, tengo los antecedentes y experiencia. He demostrado que puedo trabajar en diferentes comit\u00e9s. Trabajo con miembros de DSA [Socialistas Democr\u00e1ticos de Am\u00e9rica]. Trabajo con el caucus conservador. Trabajo con el caucus de veteranos, trabajo con todos. Me aseguro de que mis ordenanzas obtengan el apoyo de todos los niveles de representaci\u00f3n en el consejo. Eso es lo que obtendr\u00e1n del alcalde Sawyer."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ald. Roderick Sawyer",
  "text": "Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward) is no stranger to Chicago politics. He\u2019s served in the City Council since 2011, when he defeated Freddrenna Lyle, who was appointed by then-mayor Richard M. Daley in 1998.\u00a0Sawyer was born and raised \u2014 and still resides \u2014 in Park Manor, one of the neighborhoods he represents in City Council, just like his father did. Like Daley, Sawyer is the son of a former Chicago mayor.\u00a0Following the death of Harold Washington, Sawyer\u2019s father, Ald. Eugene Sawyer, was tapped by a bloc of white aldermen to be mayor over Washington ally Timothy Evans. He served for two years until his defeat by Daley in the 1989 mayoral election. Daley maintained power for nearly three decades, longer than any other Chicago mayor. Sawyer explained that he follows in his father\u2019s footsteps not for family legacy, but as a public servant.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it,\u201d he said.\u00a0As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, Sawyer invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 5 to Oooh Wee It Is, a Black-owned restaurant in Chatham known for its Southern comfort food.\u00a0Currently, Sawyer serves as chairman of the City Council\u2019s Health and Human Relations Committee. In addition, he was chair of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus and the co-chair of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0He said that his record in City Council and the fact that he has garnered the support and trust of his colleagues in the chamber prove that he\u2019s equipped to be Chicago\u2019s next mayor.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had groundbreaking legislation introduced and passed in City Council, so I have a proven ability to get things done,\u201d Sawyer said.\u00a0During his tenure in City Council, he has championed issues such as the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that established an elected civilian board of Chicago residents to oversee the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the fight for a $15 minimum wage, the push for an elected representative school board and GoodKids MadCity\u2019s Peace Book Ordinance.\u00a0He\u2019s also voted in favor of unpopular measures, including Emanuel\u2019s 2011 budget, which passed unanimously and closed six of the city\u2019s 12 mental health facilities, and a 2017 move to acquire property in West Garfield Park for a cop academy, which passed 48 to 1.During our conversation, Sawyer discussed his plans to address violence, mental health, youth, housing, reparations for Black Chicagoans and more.\u00a0He is not calling to increase or decrease the CPD\u2019s budget. Instead, according to his public safety plan, he wants to recruit more police officers, fix the city\u2019s emergency response system, improve officer wellness, invest in comprehensive police training and more. In addition, he supports Treatment Not Trauma, wants to address the root causes of violence and calls for revitalizing neighborhoods that have seen decades-long disinvestment.As an alder, he voted in line with mayor Rahm Emanuel 100 percent of the time from April 2017 to November 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Read our full interview with Sawyer, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: How did growing up in Park Manor shape your politics? Ald. Roderick Sawyer: Growing up in Park Manor and still living here today is quite a testament to the neighborhood and the people there. When I was growing up, I saw it at its best. I've seen it struggling, and I've seen it in challenging times. It never eliminated my resolve to want to stay here and try to improve upon what's here.I'm very adamant about where I came from. I spend an inordinate amount of time in my neighborhood because I feel strongly about the people here. They formed me into who I am now. So as a lawyer, as a business person and as a resident, it is overwhelming the love I get from my Park Manor neighbors, my Chatham neighbors, because we've all come through that struggle. We were all little kids together, delinquents, playing in the alleys and riding our bikes throughout the area. So for me to stay here and choose to be here is not a testament to me, but it's a testament to the others around me. So that is extremely important.You are the son of Chicago's second Black mayor, Eugene Sawyer. Yes.When the City Council was selecting a successor after the passing of Harold Washington, there was concern that appointing your father to the role would mean a return to machine politics. Also, most of the support he received from the chamber came from white alderpersons who were obstructionists to then-mayor Harold Washington and his agenda. There were also some accusations from some in the community that accused your father of selling out to white politicians.\u00a0\u00a0Why are you entering the race? Is it to follow in your father's footsteps? What did you learn from your father about public service?Well, let's just make some corrections. First, my father was chosen because he was the best candidate for that position. It was a troubling time after our friend Harold Washington died.My father was both chairman of the Rules Committee and president pro tempore. So that meant he ran the Rules Committee, and when Harold stepped out, he took over the mantle. That was an enormous amount of responsibility given to my father. No one has ever held two committee chairs at the same time besides him. So I give that as a testament of trust from the mayor to my father. The mayor knew that the job was going to get done. Furthermore, when Harold died, my father passed every initiative that Harold sought to pass and was unable to because of his untimely death. Even things that were against his own personal interests.My father was a devotee of Harold Washington. So all that talk was nonsense about him being beholden to white interests. My father was a proud Black man from this neighborhood [Park Manor] and Greensboro, Alabama. A person that stood there protecting Martin Luther King\u2019s house while he was at Alabama State.\u00a0\u00a0So all that noise people made back then was very troubling. It was disheartening because my father\u2019s interests were for his residents, the city, Chicago and the 6th Ward.\u00a0To answer your ultimate question, though, my father taught me a lot about how important it is to be a good steward of your community and how important public service is. So in that regard, yes, I am following my father\u2019s footsteps, not as mayor but as a public servant here in an area where I was born and raised, and because of that and what I saw from him, how people held him in high esteem because he helped those that were in this neighborhood. So I wanted to continue in that service. I\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it.I read that you feel that crime is our city's most pressing issue. Yet, if elected, you said you would first fire CPD Police Supt. David Brown. Is that still the case? Why or why not?I think our biggest problem is crime anxiety. That means no matter where you live in the city. If you go outside, you feel there\u2019s a chance that something might happen to you. That\u2019s the anxiety, and that has a financial cost.\u00a0Those that are of means don\u2019t go out because they feel that anxiety. That means they don\u2019t spend money at restaurants, bars and theaters and gyms, breweries and health clubs and all the things that we would expect them to spend money [on].When I saw David Brown down in Dallas, I was encouraged. I thought he would be a good superintendent because he supported his police officers down in Dallas. I saw that he was hard on crime and a tough guy. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not getting that same guy here right now. This is not the same David Brown.If elected, I would use that opportunity to use the platform that I worked on for seven years, the Empowering Communities for Public Safety, or ECPS [ordinance].I'm proud to say I was the lead sponsor of the ECPS ordinance, that I helped bring it to fruition. So we'll be electing community-based members to reestablish the trust between the community and the police and when we do that, people will feel more comfortable about talking to the police. That means they'll give police more information, which means we can solve more crimes, so that's how that works. It's a ripple effect.So I am a big proponent of that. I will also use that same platform to choose a superintendent that has the respect of the police department, of the rank and file, that has been through the system, that understands what we need in order to have officers laser focus on their job, which is to apprehend bad guys and bound them over for trial.Do you believe in increasing or decreasing CPD's budget? How do you feel the police budget should be allocated? We should have the resources necessary to respond to service calls. The City of Chicago is in a service business. That's especially true for the police. Police are a service. They're public servants; they serve you and serve everyone here.So if we don't have enough officers to respond to calls and it takes more than an hour to respond to calls, that's a problem. That's increasing that same anxiety I talked about. So now I've got robbed, I call the police, and no one shows up. That feels like no one's protecting me. That's that continued anxiety. So it won't make me feel better if no one shows up.\u00a0\u00a0So here\u2019s what we're talking about doing for nonviolent calls, let's say, unfortunately, you got robbed, but you're okay. You don\u2019t get harmed. They took your wallet, purse or car. You can call 9-1-1, and we can send somebody over to get a report from you, a uniformed officer. It can be a retired officer that knows how to take the report and get descriptions from you and pass on that information to those on the street that can hopefully apprehend that suspect or that offender and get them bound over for trial.How will you be investing in safety? Based on what you said, does that mean that you would hire more police officers?I would hire police officers where appropriate. I would make sure that we get past the level of retirements and defections. People are leaving. And ensure that it's not an either-or approach. I believe in getting the officers staffed to the appropriate level. Maybe it's retired officers or civilians that we need to hire to get those officers that we need to get on the street.\u00a0We may just need to reallocate some positions. But that doesn't mean we should not invest in mental health services, job opportunities, employment training, drug and substance abuse, or addiction. No, it's a both-and approach. We need to invest in all of those things.Are there other ways outside of police that you would invest in safety? Again, invest in mental health services treatment response that, maybe, someone can de-escalate a situation instead of arresting somebody. We can provide drug addiction services to those that are dependent. We need to invest in both of those things. It's not a do this and don't do that. You do both.In 2020, you proposed removing CPD from CPS in City Council. Has your opinion on that changed? Why or why not?Well, let me say this. My goal was not to remove police officers from schools. I wanted to spark a conversation on what police officers do in certain schools and how it sometimes has a negative effect on its students. I\u2019m glad it worked out the way it did because schools now make a choice. They can choose whether they want officers in their school or don\u2019t want officers, and it\u2019s a school LSC [Local School Council] choice. I\u2019m really happy with the way it came out.\u00a0People just misconstrued my goal. My goal was to spark a discussion, which it did. Sometimes you have to do bold things, and that\u2019s why you need a leader that will not be afraid to make a bold decision. I didn\u2019t make a rash decision; I made a bold decision.\u00a0We ended up saving some money. We saved several million dollars for those schools that chose not to have officers in their school and those that kept officers in schools that were happy with their officers. It empowered LSCs and others to make decisions on the future of their schools, which I'm happy that I did.Many of your colleagues voted in favor of Mayor Lightfoot's proposal to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth despite critics saying it would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth. You were one of the Black alders that voted against it. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? How would you fund these plans?We were thinking about how to keep them away, as opposed to how we engage with them and have them in a safe space where they can enjoy themselves, and when it's time to go home, they'll go home. They're tired, and they had a good time. We provided something good for them, and the organizers made a little money. That's how I made money as a kid. I threw parties. I was a DJ, threw parties, and was involved in that.\u00a0So I don't see that in youth right now. That's why they're so frustrated they don't have anywhere to let off that steam. When you're young, you have a lot of pent-up energy that you need to release, so that's dancing and acting silly for a minute. We needed to provide that for them. So they get frustrated, and they're going to act out, and that's what happened and that's a failure on our part.As an alderperson, you voted to shut down half of the city's mental health clinics during then-mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration. Yet, on your campaign website, you said you support Treatment Not Trauma. If you support Treatment Not Trauma, why did you vote to close those mental health clinics?When I was elected, I came in as chairman of the health and human relations committee, and the first thing I did was visit the remaining mental health centers. They were empty.\u00a0\u00a0There were hardly any patients at any level. I visited all of them. They said no alder ever visited them. I\u2019ve visited all of them. The first thing I did was to look at all of them and see what the resources were and if they were busy. Did we need to provide more resources?Back when I made that vote about the mental health centers, I did an article a couple of years later, and I said if I could take one vote back, the only vote I would take back was the closing of the mental health service [clinics]. We should have dived into that further.I don\u2019t think they shouldn\u2019t have been closed. We should have dived into it a bit further to find out why the administration wanted them closed. We did not do that; it was a cost-cutting money-saving measure. My eyes were opened when I visited them and realized that we were not using them. We were not advertising for them, and we\u2019re not promoting them. It wasn\u2019t known that they existed and that people could go there for free.\u00a0I realized they weren\u2019t accepting children. Because of our advocacy, they\u2019re caring for children now. They\u2019re expanding their hours, and they\u2019re starting to put promotions on. So I played a role in ensuring the administration became aware of a problem related to our mental health service.As you know, voters in your ward overwhelmingly supported the Treatment Not Trauma ballot referendum during the 2022 midterm. If elected, how would you fund the specific plans under the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance?We have funding available for Treatment Not Trauma. The Department of Health has a robust budget. We can fund Treatment Not Trauma, with no problems. Because that money is earmarked for certain things, we can have that money available for things like mental health services. We can use the money that's available now.\u00a0It's not as much a funding issue. It's an intentionality issue. Do people want this to happen? I don't see why you would not want it. You can save someone's life by providing them with mental health services instead of bringing in a police officer.\u00a0A police officer is trained to do a certain thing. Police officers are trained to apprehend and arrest. That's their job. It is needed in certain instances: when someone's robbing you, you want the police. When someone's having a mental health breakdown, you don't want the police. You want a mental health expert. You want somebody that can say, \u201ccalm down,\u201d or direct you to proper services. You need that kind of calming, de-escalating voice that could assist you.The COVID-19 pandemic has already highlighted existing disparities in schools with funding and resources, especially for Black and brown students. What policies will you enact in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school.We're about to have an elected representative school board that will be autonomous and work independently. In the interim, I will ensure that the schools have all the necessary resources to make them successful. I'm a big proponent of neighborhood schools.\u00a0\u00a0I want to ensure that we're getting all the resources possible to the most students because that's what's important. The future of our city is our children. I want to ensure that whatever we do, as relates to Chicago Public Schools, is in the right vein, without doing something crazy. I've worked with CTU [Chicago Teachers Union] in the past, and I'll continue to work with CTU going into the future. I'm just not beholden to CTU.\u00a0 I'm not going to be dictated to by anyone.How will you fund plans to invest in neighborhood schools?I've been around a long time, and I've been an LSC Chairman for 12 years as well. I've always been of the opinion that we run a lean, mean ship, as relates to your school finances. Money spent on certain ridiculous things sometimes has to be looked at and has to be eliminated. So you want to make sure that the schools can operate independently, within the confines of their budget based on student formula. That needs to be changed, but that's part of it. I think that's part of a longer discussion that has to be done with the state. I am going to dive into those types of things. Because when I talk about resetting Chicago, these are the types of things that we need to be resetting.Who will you appoint to this hybrid board?I would like a mix of educators, community people and those interested in our children's future. I don't think I have a tried-and-true set measure of who I want to appoint as far as people. Still, you want people in the financial industry so they understand how to operate budgets and adhere to them. You want educators, so we have a proper plan for all students, not just the high-performing ones.\u00a0You also want people that can engage parents and other committee members to get involved in what's happening in the schools. Schools should be open all day and evening, with resources and programs for students, and if necessary, parents. Sometimes parents need some additional training or education. So you want all that to happen, and that school should be that center of that neighborhood with all those resources in one place.You mentioned that you\u2019ve worked with the Chicago Teachers Union. Is there a specific plan or proposal that you have to fund schools? Because I was looking at your website, it wasn't clear what those policies would look like. Funding comes from a variety of sources: some from property taxes, some from our state and federal government, some from the city of Chicago. We want to make sure that we look at all those funding sources and see how they\u2019re operating.We keep increasing school funding, even though the number of enrollments keeps going down, something's not making sense. Once I can get there, take a look at it, and dive into it, we'll see what the problem is. Is it heavy on the front end? Does CPS hold too much real estate that's not performing? Is it budgetary issues? Do we have too many assistant directors and assistant commissioners in the front office and need more people on the frontline teaching our children?I know that many schools have eliminated the APs [assistant principals]. But, for example, that should not happen. We removed assistants in kindergarten and first grade, where now you have a teacher alone with 35 five-year-olds. Not a sustaining method, and it won\u2019t improve education.\u00a0\u00a0So I would like to look into these things and ensure that we\u2019re doing what\u2019s right by our students, not necessarily by the union [CTU] or front office personnel. We have to focus on what\u2019s important, and it\u2019s those children.Our readers are curious about taxes. So would what you\u2019re proposing to do require raising property taxes?No, that's a last resort. I will say that many candidates use this as a selling point about saying \"no taxes\" or \"never tax.\" You should have a responsible tax policy.\u00a0 A responsible tax policy, for example, as it relates to real estate taxes, is small, incremental steps in improving taxes.\u00a0If our CPI [consumer price index] goes up, we should have a small raise in property taxes to reflect the increased cost of goods and services. So if that happens, we need to make that incremental change instead of what we've been doing now, saying everything's fine. \u201cNo, we don't need to raise taxes ever, ever, ever until after an election to, \u201coh, we got to raise taxes.\u201d That's irresponsible, and it's wrong. We should be looking at more responsible tax policies, something that people won't even notice a one to two percent increase in their taxes every so often.If the CPI goes down, then we can look at rebates and maybe refunds for those that pay taxes. But again, only if the financial picture looks like it's warranted, not just because people like to hear it and we don't do it. That's what got us into the problem in the first place about not paying our pension obligations and not raising taxes to do necessary things, as opposed to doing popular things.Chicago is a city full of vibrant neighborhoods. But it\u2019s becoming difficult for many people to remain in the city. There are new developments that are coming in the center of neighborhoods. I\u2019m speaking specifically about Bally's casino project. You voted in favor of that. So what policies will you enact to support homeowners and renters from displacement and or people experiencing homelessness?I did vote in favor of that. One, we do have a very robust budget right now for homelessness. The problem is we only spent about 5 percent of the money. We have a lot of money sitting there just waiting to spend on homeless initiatives. We're sometimes looking in the wrong direction. I don't want to spend money that will benefit developers more than it benefits the homeless. That's where I really have a problem, and I stand by that.\u00a0\u00a0So when people talk about things like Bring Chicago Home, I love what the intention is. But when you peel back the onion, and I peeled back the onion, developers would tend to benefit more than the homeless people will. We can help the homeless right now. We can almost eradicate homelessness except for a couple of issues.\u00a0We have money to house the people that we count. Most of them don't want to go into the types of structures we've been used to building. They'd rather be in that community that they're in off of Roosevelt Road on the expressway because at least they know that they're going to care for each other. That\u2019s where their community is.\u00a0We may not understand it. I've talked to enough homeless people to know that sometimes the help they're looking for is not the help that we're used to providing. If we're saying, I can take care of you and put you in a shelter. They don't want to be in a shelter. They know they've been robbed and raped and assaulted in shelters, they have a bad experience in the shelters, they don't want to go back.\u00a0Let's talk about giving them resources, treatment, opportunity, employment, and training, to get them to a space where we can get them a starter home or starter apartment, and then they can continue to get the treatment or work experience to earn money. That's what I look at. I look at more organic solutions, not just saying, hey, let's plop them in a flophouse down in a mission and we've done our part. That's short-sighted.I remember being at a meeting where you were with other Black elected officials. At the meeting, you explained how challenging it is for you and your colleagues to represent parts of Englewood because it has so many vacant and abandoned properties. What are your plans to revitalize neighborhoods, like Englewood, with many vacant areas/properties? What we don't do is give our Black developers and all minority developers, for that sake, resources and opportunities to develop in their backyards and their homes. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, you name it. We have abandoned areas all over the city, and could benefit from developers coming. No downtown developer is going to come out here, and they'll tell you the same thing. I\u2019ve had a developer tell me if I build in Fulton Market, I can get this much per unit rent or sell it. If I build out here, I can\u2019t get this much unless you can find the difference. What's my incentive in coming out here to build?\u00a0We got African American builders that will build. We\u2019d have to relax some of the union issues, and other issues to give them a leg up to do quality developments here on the South and the West sides.\u00a0We need to start doing that and getting these developers engaged so they can no longer be small developers. They'll have a goal and a mindset to deal more in a neighborhood that helped raise them as opposed to just going downtown.They can build a block at a time. Maybe two or three developers, then build the entire block then we can do another block. Because I literally have blocks of vacant land in this little area of Englewood that I have. I know my colleagues have even larger swaths of land that could be developed and sold or rented, or whatever the case may be, to homeowners who are working, but they need help to make ends meet.\u00a0We can get them that quality, affordable housing out here. Close to the L line. If they're working downtown, they can pop on the L in 15 minutes, then be at work or school or whatever the case may be. We need to start looking at that instead of just being downtown centric. However, I know how important downtown is to our bottom line. But it's not the end all be all.Black Chicagoans have been leaving for the city in droves since the 2000s for many reasons. But I wonder what specific policies or plans your administration will enact so we don't lose more Black Chicagoans. We must have a marketing plan for bringing people back home to Chicago. It should literally be: bring Chicagoans back home. We need to engage with marketing people, preferably Black people. Chicago is a great city. Chicago has plenty of amenities. It's a world-class city. We can trim off the problematic things and get those vibrant. There's no other city better.\u00a0We need to promote that and make an investment. Sometimes you have to invest to get something back. I don't like spending money just to be spending money; giveaways and gimmicks are not my thing. So we're going to make true investments in Chicago, invest in the future of Chicago, ensuring that people know how great Chicago is and the amenities we can provide them.\u00a0Englewood can be restored to great glory. It's intentionality who's at the head, spearheading that, and has that sense of vision to say that we can do this here in Englewood, we can do this in East Garfield Park, we can do this in Lawndale. We can do this and all these other challenging areas, like Pilsen and Little Village. We can do it in areas that have been marginalized in the past. It takes the leader at the top to say, this is what we're going to do, and this is how we will do it.How do we fund that?There are a variety of ways to fund it. There's bond funding. There are a lot of different funding mechanisms, particularly in blighted areas. We will work with our partners in the state and federal government. We might have to issue bonds. We had to issue some debt in order to get some of the things done and kick-start it.\u00a0 There's a variety of ways. We're not broke. We sometimes struggle because we make bad decisions, and we need to make fewer bad decisions and more financially conservative decisions that make sense. You make investments; you don't spend money.Speaking of investment in Black Chicago and keeping Black people here, should reparations be at the forefront in 2023?I feel it should be. I've been trying to push reparations for years. After learning more about it, I introduced it to the City Council.The mayor told me: \u201cI wasn't doing \"s---\" about reparations; that's nothing but a Willie Wilson gimmick.\u201dMr. Wilson was helping us financially with getting the word out about reparations. He was learning about reparations as well. We were doing what we could to show how important the repair part was. I\u2019ve talked to epidemiologists and epigeneticists.The problems that we have currently go back to us being enslaved and going through the Jim Crow Era, and the redlining and all the things that we\u2019ve gone through over decades and decades, and it makes us react a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0We need to dive into that and find out what that problem is, and once we do that, everybody benefits. So I\u2019m not as interested in something other than the 40 acres and mule money type of thing. That\u2019s more of a federal conversation. Mine is more the health disparities, educational disparities and things like that that are important, and there\u2019s a reason for that. There\u2019s a reason for that, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve dove into it enough. There\u2019s a word for that. The mayor [Lightfoot] would not use the word reparations. If you ask her, she would not say reparations.Your initial plan was just getting a commission?We've done enough studying. It wasn\u2019t about a study. I wanted a reparations commission equal to Streets and Sanitation and the Department of Transportation. I wanted an executive-level commission on reparations to discuss the repair we need as descendants of enslaved Africans.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't get support. I couldn't even get Black support. It was difficult because people didn't understand it. I remember having a few of my colleagues go to a couple of meetings because I had to have off-site meetings, and I could not get a meeting in council.\u00a0Under my administration, reparations will be at the forefront. We got to talk about it. We have to do it. We have to understand, and I want more people to understand. I want white people and everybody to understand it because it's vital for all.I noticed that you don't necessarily have large-scale endorsements like your other opponents in the race.No, because I'm not beholden to anybody in this race.So who are you accountable to?I'm accountable to the citizens of the city of Chicago. These are the people I hold in high esteem, and I feel accountable to everyday residents, people that go to work every day, unemployed people, people that are struggling and people that do well. I represent true Chicagoans, those that want good schools, vibrant business districts, safe streets and to enjoy their neighborhoods and go home safely. These are the people that I represent. These are the people that support me.I had to look at some previous articles and interviews to prepare my questions today because your website doesn\u2019t have a policy platform written out in detail at the time of this interview. How can Chicago voters be confident in you as a policymaker and hold you accountable for your campaign promises?I've been as prodigious on policy matters as any alderman in the City Council. From anti-privatization to police reform to business initiatives, I've shown my chops in bringing things forward and getting things done.\u00a0The elected representative school board, we were there \u2014 labor peace at the airports and childcare. These are things that I was always at the forefront of, leading, not just voting for it \u2014 leading, advocating getting votes, whipping votes for it, and passing it.\u00a0My history speaks for itself. I have the background. I have proven that I can work within different committees. I work with DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] members. I work with the conservative caucus. I work with the veteran's caucus, I work with everyone. I ensure that my ordinances get support from all levels of representation on the council. That's what you'll get from Mayor Sawyer."

  "text": "An audio recording allegedly between Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant Rickey Hendon and a volunteer for Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s campaign has leaked \u2014 and the talk details a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson.Green is also accusing Wilson of violating the residency requirements to run for Chicago mayor, claiming Wilson\u2019s main home is in south suburban Hazel Crest. The two candidates have a history dating back to at least the 2019 Chicago municipal election, when Hendon \u2014 who was Wilson\u2019s campaign advisor at the time \u2014 challenged Green\u2019s petitions. After that, Green clashed with Hendon, with Hendon later posting on Facebook that he and Green exchanged threats about fighting one another.\u00a0\u201cIf you withdraw, I will take care of you. And you can tell me how much you would need,\u201d Hendon, a former state senator and Chicago alder (27th Ward), allegedly said on the recent phone call. That audio was released on Thursday.\u00a0Chicago-based What\u2019s the Word TV was the first media outlet to publish the full recording on its Instagram page on Thursday morning. What\u2019s the Word TV has since removed the video, although The TRiiBE has retained the audio and video. (Read the full transcript below.)\u00a0Additionally, Chicago-based blog Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s posted the video on its Instagram page, and it was still up at publishing time.\u201cYou know, don\u2019t nobody want you to lose money, you know, \u2018cause Ja\u2019Mal ain\u2019t \u2018gon be on the ballot, bro. I wouldn\u2019t do that shit,\u201d Hendon allegedly continued on the call. He also mentioned Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), who is also in the 2023 race for mayor.\u201cSawyer ain\u2019t gon be on the ballot,\u201d Hendon allegedly said. \u201cI never miss. Don\u2019t shoot if I\u2019ma miss.\u201dIn a response to The TRiiBE, Wilson\u2019s campaign spokesperson Richard Boykin confirmed that Hendon\u2019s voice is on the recording.\u201cThe comments made by former Sen. Rickey Hendon were not authorized by me or my campaign. This is a personal issue between Sen. Hendon and Mr. Green,\u201d Boykin wrote in a press release on Thursday.In a press release issued at 4:45 p.m. on Thursday, Green\u2019s team identified the volunteer on the call as Kevin Hobby and acknowledged the conversation. Green said, \u201cI\u2019m glad someone was able to capture the corrupt openness Ricky has. Let me just say that the old way of politics is pulling some desperate moves to drag me and my campaign down, going so far as to offer financial compensation to my ally. This city\u2019s corrupt nature shows its face almost out in the open now. The sleazy deals, the open bribery, the big money talking \u2014 it needs to end! That\u2019s why I am running for mayor in the first place.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for the new generation of leadership, if the audio didn\u2019t prove it then I\u2019m not sure what will.\u201dIllinois law makes it a felony to intercept, record or transcribe any private telephone or electronic communication unless all parties consent. The TRiiBE has not yet been able to verify if the conversation was recorded legally.\n        \u201cWe should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a South Side resident.According to Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, businessman Wilson and community activist and entrepreneur Green are attempting to rid the current 11-candidate field of the other, while Wilson also filed a separate challenge to Sawyer. Other candidates are seeking to knock off long-shot candidates Frederick Collins and Johnny Logalbo.TRANSCRIPT:Rickey Hendon: And I ain\u2019t even gotta tell you, you know. The lines, we both know y\u2019all weren\u2019t in there looking at them [unintelligible] lines. So Willie\u2019s gonna make it. Ja\u2019Mal is not. Why you have to suffer? We can work something out. You come on our team or not. But I didn\u2019t want to jam you, bruh. I got people that know you that\u2019s [unintelligible] a game called [unintelligible]. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m coming from.\u00a0Kevin Hobby: What you, what you, what you offering?Rickey Hendon: Say what now?Kevin Hobby: What you offering?Rickey Hendon: Well, you know, everybody can use some help financially. So I will help you there if that was the case. I mean, I could just go through the case, you know, Willie got money. He can pay the lawyer. Done paid the lawyer already. But I\u2019d like to get it over with, you know, so let me know what you\u2019re trying to do.

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired. Lightfoot said doing so would be the easy political thing to do but explained that it wasn\u2019t the appropriate action to take. Instead, she\u2019s calling what happened a teachable moment.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I\u2019m a role model to young women across the city, and I have an obligation given that to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to teach and mentor,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to learn and for me to be a mentor and nurture her,\u201d she added.\u00a0Also, on Thursday, the City Colleges of Chicago confirmed receiving an email from Lightfoot\u2019s campaign last August seeking student volunteers.\u201cCity Colleges staff notified the campaign of CCC\u2019s ethics policy and purged the emails from CCC accounts. City Colleges is not aware of having received subsequent campaign emails but is looking into the matter,\u201d the statement reads.\u00a0On Wednesday evening, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s campaign came under fire after asking Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage students to help her get re-elected in exchange for school credit. WTTW Politics Reporter Heather Cherone first reported the story.\u00a0\u201cLate yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to the campaign . . . a campaign staffer accessed publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a one-on-one interview with The TRiiBE before a Thursday afternoon press conference. \u201cObviously, that was a mistake. From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "title": "Who\u2019s in the wrong? A deeper look into Willie Wilson, Ja\u2019Mal Green and the alleged bribe",
  "text": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since an audio recording leaked that featured a phone conversation between businessman Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant, Rickey Hendon, and a volunteer for community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s campaign. During that conversation, Hendon allegedly bribed the volunteer, Kevin Hobby, to drop Green\u2019s petition challenge against Wilson in the 2023 Chicago mayoral election.This also comes just as objection filings kicked off last week, which is a standard process in which one candidate objects to the signatures of another candidate. Over the next few weeks, the Chicago Board of Elections commissioners will review all the signatures that have been opposed and decide if those signatures (or challenges) are valid.\u00a0On Dec. 5, Wilson and Green filed petition challenges against one another; a victory by either would narrow the 11-candidate field for the mayor\u2019s race. Wilson also filed a separate challenge against another mayoral candidate: 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer. Other candidates seek to knock off long-shot candidates Frederick Collins and Johnny Logalbo.Chicago-based What\u2019s the Word TV was the first media outlet to publish the full recording of the leaked audio on its Instagram page on Dec. 8. The outlet has since removed the video. However, Chicago-based blog Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s also posted the video on its Instagram page.\u00a0On Dec. 8, in response to an inquiry from The TRiiBE, Wilson\u2019s campaign spokesperson, Richard Boykin, confirmed that it was Hendon\u2019s voice on the recording.\u00a0There were various opinions in the Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s comment section ranging from: \u201cPolitics as usual in the Chi,\u201d to \u201cno betta game anywhere than Chicago politics! Hollywood needs to stop,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s politics. What else is new\u201d or\u00a0 \u201cThis is why we have to support @jaymalgreen our future depends on it, these old-school politicians are outrageous.\u201d\u00a0Veteran political and media consultant Delmarie Cobb told The TRiiBE that the leaked audio recording is a bad look for both campaigns.\u00a0Although she added that what Hendon is accused of is unethical, the situation, she said, shows that Wilson\u2019s campaign will \u201cstoop to any level to win\u201d and \u201cthat it makes his [Wilson\u2019s] campaign look desperate,\u201d but added that it demonstrates that Green \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who people think did the most wrong,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cSo, what side is public perception going to fall down on? Is it going to fall on the side of \u2018You can\u2019t be trusted? Or you\u2019ll do anything to win.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n        Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant Rickey Hendon allegedly called Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s team to bribe them to drop the challenge.Commenters on Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s post mirror Cobb\u2019s view of the situation. Some suggested that by recording the conversation, Green hurt his chances of winning the race. At the same time, some indicated that Green should not have recorded the conversation or that he should have accepted the bribe and bowed out of the race altogether. Others said that it was discouraging to see two mayoral campaigns acting in such a way.\u00a0Most comments also showed that most Chicagoans are used to seeing elected officials and candidates behaving like Hendon or Green. To many commenters, what transpired between Hendon\u2019s and Green\u2019s campaigns is just the Chicago way when it comes to politics.\u00a0Think back to Rod Blagojevich, the disgraced former Illinois governor who was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0Or consider current Chicago City Councilmembers Carrie Austin (34th Ward) and Ed Burke (14th Ward) as well as former 20th Ward Ald. Willie Cochran.In 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Burke faces racketeering, bribery and extortion charges based on allegations that he used his political power to force those doing business with the city to hire his private law firm, WTTW noted. Burke\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin in November 2023. In addition, both Austin and Burke announced that they would not be running in the 2023 municipal election after serving a combined total of 81 years.\u00a0In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in prison in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0Chicago continues to be the most corrupt city in Illinois, according to a 2020 University of Illinois at Chicago study. Since 1973, 30 alderpersons have been convicted of corruption, according to Block Club Chicago.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.However, what makes this case stand out among the decades-long history of elected leaders making deals behind closed doors is that the public heard the alleged bribe on audio and it was widely shared on social media platforms, said Cobb.\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of people trading jobs, money [and] contracts. People trade all of those things,\u201d Cobb explained.\u00a0It\u2019s a political strategy. Opponents in the race want to eliminate as many people as possible to avoid a runoff. She explained that the more candidates there are, the harder it becomes to avoid a runoff. The last two mayoral races, in 2015 and 2019, resulted in runoff elections.\u00a0So Cobb said it\u2019s common for some candidates to tell their opponents, \u201cI don\u2019t want you splitting the vote when you don\u2019t have a chance of winning. You don\u2019t have a chance of being the nominee. So we need you to get out. What would it take to get you out?\u2018\u201dAlthough it is a common practice, Cobb said that what is illegal in this case is whether or not Green\u2019s campaign worker recorded the conversation without Hendon\u2019s consent.\u00a0In a Dec. 8 press release, Green\u2019s team identified the volunteer on the call as Hobby.\u00a0\u201cAfter talking with our counsel, the video did not break the law as it was a public setting & Rickey was engaging in criminal activity. We want the proper authorities to investigate this matter further,\u201d according to a statement from Green.\u00a0In Illinois, it is a felony to intercept, record or transcribe any private telephone call or electronic communication unless all parties consent.\u00a0According to Ed Mullen, a Chicago-based election attorney, the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office (CCSAO) would be the agency tasked with investigating the matter further.\u00a0\u201cThe Chicago Board of Elections doesn\u2019t have a lot of authority,\u201d Mullen explained. \u201cSo they\u2019re not going to do any type of investigation into election interference. It would be either the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office or the U.S. attorney.\u201dAt publishing time, it\u2019s unclear if Green\u2019s team filed a complaint with the CCSAO. The CCSAO could not be reached for comment.\u00a0Cobb said that some candidates decide to run for office for their own benefit.\u00a0\u201cThis is a long tradition of people offering jobs, money and contracts to get out of the race. But, on the other hand, some candidates get in the race hoping to be offered those things,\u201d she said.\u00a0Cobb said voters should examine how candidates are moving to vet their legitimacy come election time. That means researching whether they have a campaign headquarters and an updated campaign website that includes policy and their platform. In addition, their websites should not have misspelled words or grammatical errors. Without those things, it\u2019s clear to see who\u2019s a serious candidate, she said.\u00a0"

  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "text": "Mayoral candidate Paul Vallas\u2019s son Gus was one of three San Antonio police officers who fatally shot a Black man who was fleeing in March 2022, a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 8.\u00a0The family of the man, 28-year-old Kevin Donel Johnson Jr., told Texas Public Radio the officers shot him nine times. San Antonio police chief William McManus said at the time that all three officers shot Johnson. In a body-worn camera video the San Antonio Police Department (SAPD) released in April 2022, at least ten shots are audible.Johnson\u2019s sister told Texas Public Radio that officers hit Johnson, who was on a bicycle, with their patrol car at the start of the chase. The SAPD statement did not acknowledge whether this occurred.\u201cCurrently, the Bexar County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, Civil Rights Division, is reviewing the shooting of Kevin Johnson,\u201d a spokesperson for the District Attorney\u2019s Office in Bexar County, which encompasses San Antonio, told The TRiiBE.\u00a0In a statement to The TRiiBE on Feb. 8, the Vallas for Mayor campaign wrote, \u201cThe matter was the subject of a complete investigation. Gus Vallas was found not to have engaged in any violation of policy and was returned to full duty.\u201dContent warning: This video depicts graphic police violenceAccording to the SAPD, Officer Gus Vallas, who had been with the department for four years, was one of three police who began chasing Johnson because he was wanted on a warrant for parole violations and a weapons charge. In the video released by the department, the officers chased Johnson on foot until he waded across a creek and stumbled up the far embankment.\u00a0One officer can be heard shouting, \u201cGet down, boy!\u201d\u00a0As he attempted to climb the creek\u2019s far embankment, Johnson stumbled, fell to the ground and rolled onto his back, at which point officers shouted that he had a gun in his hand and opened fire from the other side of the creek, killing him in a barrage of shots. They continued to fire after he was motionless. According to the SAPD, other officers recovered a handgun near Johnson\u2019s body.Ananda Tomas, the founder and executive director of ACT4SA, a San Antonio organization that advocates for police accountability, told The TRiiBE the body camera footage shows \u201ca firing squad\u201d that shot Johnson as he was running away. At the time of the shooting, Tomas attended protests and advocated for the release of the body-worn camera video.\u201cThe officers involved were aggressive from the start,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cThey clipped Kevin\u2019s bike when they saw him. So, they already set the stage for this young man to be fearful for his life.\u201d\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Texas Public Radio reported that after the shooting, community members gathered at the scene. After officers pushed them down the street, a scuffle broke out, and Johnson\u2019s mother was left bruised by police.In June 2022, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) amended its foot pursuit policy as a result of the fatal shootings of 13-year-old Adam Toledo, who had dropped a gun and raised his hands when he was shot, and 22-year-old Anthony Alvarez, who was fleeing with a gun and was shot in the back. The updated policy prohibits foot chases for minor offenses or simply because someone is fleeing. It allows officers to use their discretion in cases where someone has committed or is committing a crime that poses \u201can obvious threat to any person.\u201d\u00a0When the amended policy was announced, candidate Paul Vallas was critical of it. In a tweet at the time, he wrote:\u201c@ChiefDavidBrown unveils new policy: @Chicago_Police no longer allowed to chase people on foot \u201cb/c they run away.\u201d This will embolden criminals & make the city even more dangerous. We need MORE proactive policing, not less! #ChiMayor23\u201dPaul Vallas has accepted the endorsement of Chicago\u2019s Fraternal Order of Police."

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "El Dr. Willie Wilson no cambiar\u00e1 por nadie. Como producto de la Gran Migraci\u00f3n, es esa parte de \u00e9l que muchos encuentran m\u00e1s respetable. Nacido en Luisiana en 1948, trabaj\u00f3 junto a sus padres como aparceros. Aterriz\u00f3 en el West Side de Chicago en 1965. Trabaj\u00f3 en trabajos ocasionales hasta que lo contrataron en McDonald\u2019s. Cruz\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de piquetes para ser ascendido a gerente y se convirti\u00f3 en uno de los primeros afroamericanos en ser due\u00f1o de una franquicia de McDonald\u2019s, lo que lo coloc\u00f3 en el camino para convertirse en un millonario hecho por s\u00ed mismo que hoy da miles de d\u00f3lares a la comunidad.\u201cNegocios, pr\u00e1cticamente he hecho eso y no quiero m\u00e1s negocios. Podemos regalar $10 millones, $5 millones a la comunidad en un a\u00f1o, lo que podamos hacer\u201d, dijo Wilson a The TRiiBE . \u201cPero si est\u00e1s en el gobierno como alcalde de la ciudad de Chicago, puedes asegurarte de que haya igualdad de oportunidades, igualdad para todos los ciudadanos, sin dejar a nadie atr\u00e1s por el color de su piel\u201d.Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos para alcalde del 2023, Before the Polls, Wilson invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 2 de enero a su penthouse en el centro de Chicago, un opulento cuartel general de campa\u00f1a en el piso 46 con vistas de 180 grados del lago Michigan. Inicialmente pens\u00f3 que \u00e9ramos \u201clos burgueses\u201d, y bromeando dijo que planeaba ser breve con nosotros.\u00a0Pero cuando se enter\u00f3 de mis ra\u00edces en el West Side, baj\u00f3 la guardia y habl\u00f3 con m\u00e1s tranquilidad. \u201cEl pan y la mantequilla de Chicago, especialmente la gente de mi edad, son b\u00e1sicamente de Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas y Alabama\u201d, dijo.\u201cEs un mundo diferente ahora. Quiero decir, la gente es diferente. \u00bfC\u00f3mo llamas a los j\u00f3venes? \u00bfProgresivos? Nunca miramos nada progresista. Solo \u00e9ramos personas normales\u201d, dijo Wilson. \u201cDecid\u00ed quedarme igual y no cambiar. Chicago, me quedar\u00e9 con mis costumbres de Luisiana. Eso es lo que sigo siendo hoy. Luisiana.\u201dLa inmutabilidad de Wilson es la parte de \u00e9l que los votantes deber\u00edan considerar al elegir al pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago.\u00a0En la secci\u00f3n de seguridad p\u00fablica de nuestra entrevista, Wilson dijo que, de ser elegido, pedir\u00eda m\u00e1s vigilancia; tambi\u00e9n dijo espec\u00edficamente \u201cTenemos que quitarle las esposas a la polic\u00eda\u201d en su anuncio de la plataforma de seguridad del verano del 2022 y que la polic\u00eda deber\u00eda \u201ccazarlos como si fueran conejos\u201d, refiri\u00e9ndose a los sospechosos, en un debate de alcaldes el 19 de enero. Eso no es sorprendente: la FOP respald\u00f3 su candidatura al Senado de los EE.UU. del 2020, y se inform\u00f3 que Wilson busc\u00f3 el respaldo de la FOP esta vez, pero Paul Vallas lo obtuvo.A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, cuando se le hicieron preguntas sobre las pol\u00edticas de seguridad p\u00fablica, como la Ley SAFE-T y el Tratamiento, no el Trauma, Wilson indic\u00f3 que no hab\u00eda le\u00eddo nada al respecto o que no estaba familiarizado con \u00e9l.(Esta entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: Su historia es una con la que muchas personas mayores Negras de Chicago se identifican. \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 su crecimiento en su entorno a qui\u00e9n es usted hoy, su pol\u00edtica y su visi\u00f3n de la vida?Willie: Ser del sur sent\u00f3 las bases para el resto de mi vida. Me ense\u00f1\u00f3 a trabajar, respeto e integridad. Hacia el sur, saludamos a todo el mundo. Podr\u00edas caminar por el sur y alguien conseguir\u00eda una casa aqu\u00ed, y literalmente podr\u00edas entrar, sentarte y empezar a comer. Todos ser\u00edan bienvenidos. No habr\u00eda cerradura en las puertas. Habr\u00eda un pestillo, pero eso era solo para el viento. Y no habr\u00eda contratos que firmar. \u00c9ramos aparceros. Simplemente confiamos en todos.Y nadie muri\u00f3 en mi comunidad en el sur por un allanamiento o un arma de fuego. Nadie. Todo el mundo muri\u00f3 [de] causas naturales. Eso fue todo.De sus apariciones p\u00fablicas en Chicago, est\u00e1 muy claro que muchos en los lados del sur, norte y oeste de la ciudad se conectan con usted. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 cree que es as\u00ed?Las personas de mi edad se relacionan conmigo porque tenemos mucho en com\u00fan. Ahora, tenemos algunos de los j\u00f3venes. Tenemos algunas de las personas de mediana edad. Se relacionaron porque creo que hemos dado el ejemplo de lo que deber\u00eda ser la gente. Deben tratar de ayudarse unos a otros y no uno solo. Trabajamos duro. Tengo una compa\u00f1\u00eda Fortune 500 como McDonald's. Todo lo que tenemos, trabajamos arduamente para obtenerlo. No lo conseguimos abusando de otras personas. Creo que los j\u00f3venes buscan tener a alguien en quien pensar y que se preocupe por ellos tambi\u00e9n. Creo que ya seas un progresista, un anciano o un ni\u00f1e, todos quieren que los cuiden.Creo que los j\u00f3venes buscan tener a alguien en quien pensar y que se preocupe por ellos tambi\u00e9n. Creo que ya seas un progresista, un anciano o un ni\u00f1e, todos quieren que los cuiden.En las calles, muchos j\u00f3venes lo respetan a usted y al trabajo que est\u00e1s haciendo, especialmente los eventos ben\u00e9ficos que ha organizado para los obsequios de gasolina y comida. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es su conexi\u00f3n con los j\u00f3venes de Chicago?He ayudado a mucha gente a salir de la c\u00e1rcel por delitos menores y no violentos. Estuvieron sentados all\u00ed durante dos, tres meses. Un a\u00f1o. Ni siquiera tienen [un] juicio. Ni siquiera han ido a la corte. No s\u00e9 cu\u00e1nto dinero tom\u00e9. Fueron cientos de miles de d\u00f3lares. Y no conoc\u00eda a nadie. Entramos all\u00ed y trajimos a mi abogado y los rescatamos. Sentimos que estaba mal mantener a alguien en la c\u00e1rcel por tanto tiempo por un delito menor, no violento. Ni siquiera pod\u00edan pagar un abogado. Creo que eso tuvo mucho que ver.Y otra [cosa] es el cuidado, en cuanto al sorteo de gasolina, el sorteo de comida. Llevamos haciendo esto desde hace 35, 40 a\u00f1os. Hemos estado regalando, tal vez no tanta gasolina, pero pagando los impuestos a la propiedad de las personas y manteniendo a las personas fuera de la c\u00e1rcel, ayudando a las iglesias, comprando alimentos. Hemos gastado $60 millones, $70 millones, $80 millones.\u00a0Cuando me met\u00ed en la pol\u00edtica, todos quer\u00edan decir que lo hago por motivos ocultos. Pero la gente sabe qui\u00e9n soy. Hay algunas personas [que] tambi\u00e9n me odian, por el bien que hacemos. No soy perfecto. Para ayudar a otras personas, particularmente a nuestra gente en particular, tienes que graduarte. Y digo graduarme porque hay que maltratarte, maltratarte cuando haces el bien. Tienes que caminar solo. Tienes que ser escupido. Tienes que ser llamado nombres. A eso lo llamo graduarse. Algunas de las mismas personas que dijeron que no les ca\u00eda bien, o que hablo de cierta manera, estaban en fila para recibir gasolina.\u00bfTe enfrentas a muchas cr\u00edticas por tu forma de hablar y tu acento?S\u00ed. Pero no le doy importancia. Siempre dile a la gente de esta manera; Firmo el frente de mi cheque. Ellos firman el reverso de los suyos. Ellos trabajan para otra persona. Trabajo para mi mismo. Puedo vivir donde quiera, hacer lo que quiera hacer. No tengo que tomar un vuelo comercial. Voy en avi\u00f3n privado. Puedo ir a donde quiera ir, donde quiera que me lleve el dinero. Ni siquiera pueden salir de Chicago.Llamo a algunos de ellos burgueses. Tengo muy poco respeto por los burgueses. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque no ayudan a nadie m\u00e1s que a s\u00ed mismos. Toda la gente de Chicago tiene mucho dinero y no mueve un dedo para ayudar a nadie. Y no respeto eso, ni me preocupo por ellos.Menciono que sacaste gente de la c\u00e1rcel bajo fianza. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente acerca de la Ley SAFE-T? \u00bfEs algo que apoyas?Ha tenido algunos altibajos. No lo he mirado personalmente. No he pensado mucho en ello. Pero nuevamente, [hay] algunas cosas que pueden ser buenas all\u00ed. No lo he le\u00eddo todo personalmente. Y hay algunas cosas que pueden estar mal all\u00ed.En 2019, hizo campa\u00f1a para reducir la violencia al restablecer los empleos en la comunidad. Y luego, en el verano del 2022, durante una conferencia de prensa en la que anunci\u00f3 sus plataformas pol\u00edticas, dijo que debemos evitar que los j\u00f3venes y los pandilleros polaricen nuestra comunidad encerr\u00e1ndolos. Dijo, \"y si el fiscal del estado o alguien los deja salir, simplemente los encerraremos de nuevo\". \u00bfHa cambiado su pol\u00edtica de seguridad en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfpuede aclarar cu\u00e1l es su pol\u00edtica ahora, especialmente cuando se trata de vecindarios Negros en Chicago?No me importa de qu\u00e9 color eres. Estoy pensando en el que comete el crimen. Mi pol\u00edtica no ha cambiado. Voy a encerrarlos. Y vuelven a salir, los encerramos de nuevo. Porque el crimen no tiene color.Yo mismo estaba en una estaci\u00f3n de servicio y fui a buscar agua. Sal\u00ed, y hab\u00edan robado mi carro. Los deje tomar lo que quer\u00edan. No volv\u00ed a salir porque no quer\u00eda que ninguno de ellos causara problemas. Si eres afroamericano, blanco, latine, asi\u00e1tico americano, no me importa el color. El crimen no se defiende porque le quitaste la vida a alguien. \u00bfQu\u00e9 derecho tienes?\u00bfCree que existe una correlaci\u00f3n entre la salud mental y la violencia en Chicago? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo piensa acerca de esa correlaci\u00f3n al redactar pol\u00edticas?En primer lugar, la gente dice que tengo problemas mentales al regalar [el] dinero que regalamos. Creo que tenemos que abrir algunas cl\u00ednicas. No creo que nuestros polic\u00edas deban encerrar a personas que tienen problemas de enfermedades mentales. Creo que esos tienen que ser gente profesional. Si nos fijamos en el departamento de polic\u00eda, arrestan a muchas personas con enfermedades mentales. No est\u00e1n entrenados para eso. Abrir 25, 50 o 30 [cl\u00ednicas] para enfermedades mentales.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no usan algunas de nuestras iglesias y crean empoderamiento econ\u00f3mico dentro de ellas? Algunas de nuestras iglesias tienen todo tipo de espacio.\u00a0Mi sobrina de 14 a\u00f1os, creo que ten\u00eda 14 o 15, se suicid\u00f3 hace cuatro meses. Ese es un problema serio que no debe ser tratado [por] nuestros polic\u00edas. Perm\u00edtales usar su tiempo para trabajar en lo que necesitan hacer. Pero incluso con el departamento de polic\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n tenemos que encontrar lugares para ellos.Muchas personas regresan a la c\u00e1rcel del condado de Cook porque pueden recibir tres comidas al d\u00eda. Algunos de ellos quieren dejar de consumir drogas. Tienen un buen centro de drogas [en la c\u00e1rcel]. Es un ciclo\u00bfHay alguna parte de Tratamiento, No Trauma que apoye en lo que respecta a la salud mental y la seguridad?No, no que yo sepa. Todo lo que s\u00e9 sobre las enfermedades mentales es que necesitamos abrir la cl\u00ednica [de salud] mental; ya sea que est\u00e9n en la escuela, el hospital, la oficina de polic\u00eda, en cualquier otro lugar. Cualquier otro nombre que pueda llamarlo, no estoy familiarizado con eso.Quiere incluir oficios en el plan de estudios para los estudiantes de CPS. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se ve eso exactamente? \u00bfC\u00f3mo hace un alcalde para implementar un cambio curricular? \u00bfCu\u00e1nto dinero se tiene que aportar a eso?Bueno, encuentran dinero para financiar todo lo dem\u00e1s. Es decir, encuentran dinero para la gente que viene a la ciudad. Lo encuentran para permitir que las grandes corporaciones entren en la ciudad.Como alcalde, \u00bfde d\u00f3nde sacar\u00eda el dinero?Usando el dinero que ya tenemos. Se trata de administrar el presupuesto. Se trata de encontrar el mejor precio para el contrato. Pero la mayor\u00eda de las mismas personas que poseen esos contratos los obtienen a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o. Nunca se encontr\u00f3 mejor precios. Esos d\u00f3lares ah\u00ed, bien.Luego tienes nuevos negocios que tambi\u00e9n entran. Uno toma, como, el porcentaje. Se tienen que crear listas de los gastos, como todos los meses, tenemos que pagar nuestra renta [de] nuestro cheque de pago. Eso es algo que va en nuestra lista de gastos. As\u00ed que ese tipo de d\u00f3lares. Lo que podr\u00eda haber sido algo bueno para usar es parte del dinero de COVID.Tienes que lidiar con las c\u00e1maras de luz roja. Eso har\u00e1 que la gente se vaya de esta ciudad. Las empresas no quieren entrar y estar en la ciudad porque [sus clientes est\u00e1n desanimados]. Los clientes de Oakbrook o de Indiana van all\u00ed y compran gasolina y cosas por el estilo. As\u00ed que empiezas a eliminar esas barreras y luego la gente va a comprar m\u00e1s en la ciudad de Chicago. Esos d\u00f3lares van a salir solo de eso.Usted ha estado aqu\u00ed desde 1965. Ha hablado sobre c\u00f3mo comunidades como North Lawndale todav\u00eda se ven igual hoy que despu\u00e9s de los disturbios en 1968. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas crear\u00e1 para mejorar los vecindarios Negros que todav\u00eda est\u00e1n en un estado de desesperaci\u00f3n, para que tengan los mismos recursos que tiene el centro de Chicago?La situaci\u00f3n es asegurarnos de que tengamos una infraestructura en su lugar. Poner esos oficios en las escuelas secundarias, escuelas primarias. Usar algunas de nuestras iglesias y centros comunitarios existentes. Poner una escuela de donde se aprender trabajos de mano de hobra en las escuelas tambi\u00e9n.\u00a0Preguntar a las grandes corporaciones que tenemos en Chicago, comun\u00edcarse con ellas tambi\u00e9n y pedirles [que] capaciten a algunas personas dentro de esa gran corporaci\u00f3n y que hagan alg\u00fan tipo de incentivo fiscal. Lo haremos.Vine a Chicago en 1965. Estaba en 223 N. Leamington. Y tambi\u00e9n viv\u00ed en 2141 S. Lawndale. As\u00ed que s\u00e9 sobre Lawndale. Conozco el West Side. No pas\u00e9 demasiado tiempo en el South Side, pero soy del West Side desde 1965.\u00a0Entonces creo que lo que ha pasado es que tenemos que enfrentar el hecho de que hemos ense\u00f1ado a nuestros hijos que deben terminar la escuela secundaria. Pero tenemos que seguir mas alla de la secundaria. Necesitamos continuar y terminar la universidad. Pero el fracaso que creo que todos [hemos] hecho como padres, les fallamos al decir que necesitas un oficio junto con el diploma de escuela secundaria o el t\u00edtulo universitario.\u00bfC\u00f3mo construimos nuestras comunidades sin desplazar a la gente Negra que viven all\u00ed y darle un nuevo nombre a la comunidad? Hay algunas personas alrededor del Centro Presidencial de Obama que est\u00e1n siendo expulsadas por los propietarios y los nuevos desarrollos que son muy costosos y los llevan a tener que tomar la decision de irse.Muchos de nosotros nos vamos de Chicago debido al crimen. Muchos de nosotros nos vamos de Chicago por los impuestos.Las rentas siguen subiendo m\u00e1s alto. En algo as\u00ed, la biblioteca, antes de poner algo en la comunidad de alguien, debe consultar con la comunidad y debe ser a pedido de la comunidad. Por ejemplo, como el casino que se est\u00e1 construyendo aqu\u00ed en Chicago, la comunidad no lo quiere all\u00ed. Yo no lo hubiera puesto ah\u00ed. Lo habr\u00eda puesto en McCormick Place. La infraestructura ya est\u00e1 instalada all\u00ed.Tenemos que comunicarnos con nuestros ciudadanos. Porque si no te comunicas con nuestros ciudadanos, no tienes suerte.Luchar\u00e9 y me asegurar\u00e9 de que estos impuestos se reduzcan. Tenemos la l\u00ednea de pedido en ellos, que nadie pierde su hogar hasta que se recupere; algo as\u00ed como COVID-19. [Con] COVID-19, eventualmente se encargaron de eso. Impidieron que todos trabajaran y cuando impidieron que todos trabajaran, trajeron estos d\u00f3lares de COVID-19. Uno puede encontrar y hacer lo que uno quiere hacer si uno quiere hacerlo, cu\u00e1ndo uno quiera hacerlo y si tiene uno el coraz\u00f3n para hacerlo.Ha hablado de apoyar un salario digno. Se ha vuelto rico y exitoso gracias al crecimiento de los negocios, especialmente con las franquicias de McDonald's. \u00bfHa implementado un salario digno dentro de sus propios negocios? \u00bfC\u00f3mo apoyar\u00e1 a los trabajadores y sindicatos de Chicago que luchan hoy por un salario digno y mejores condiciones de trabajo?Mi salario promedio para mis empleados, creo que est\u00e1 un poco por encima del salario m\u00ednimo. Yo esperaria. Mi empleado promedio que trabaja para m\u00ed gana alrededor de $100,000 al a\u00f1o.\u00bfPuede decir qu\u00e9 negocio?Todos ellos. Ese es mi promedio. As\u00ed que puede haber una pareja que tal vez gane $70,000. Pero la mayor\u00eda gana $300,000, $200,000, $150,000. As\u00ed que sale el promedio.\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con sus franquicias de McDonald's?No. McDonald's es totalmente diferente. Somos un franquiciado. McDonald's Corporation es la propietaria de la tierra. Somos due\u00f1os de la franquicia. Es como si pag\u00e1ramos renta.En el momento de esta entrevista, no hay una buena lista de sus plataformas y pol\u00edticas en el sitio web de su campa\u00f1a. Si un votante de Chicago quiere aprender m\u00e1s sobre su campa\u00f1a, sobre sus pol\u00edticas, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede hacerlo?Bueno, van a mi Facebook de Willie Wilson. Creo que encontrar\u00e1s muchas cosas all\u00ed. Haz tu investigaci\u00f3n sobre m\u00ed. Busca mi nombre en Google. Estoy ah\u00ed. Soy muy conocido en el barrio. Todo el mundo sabe lo que representamos.Pero muchos candidatos tienen sus plataformas escritas en un sitio web u otros medios para leer cu\u00e1les son sus planes.Tenemos nuestro folleto. Todo est\u00e1 all\u00ed tambi\u00e9n. Tenemos miles y miles de entrevistas. Hacemos reuniones. No soy lo que llamas el \"candidato regular\". No voy a ser, ni voy a recibir un cheque de pago. No voy a tomar $50,000, $100,000 o $200,000 porque entonces estoy trabajando para alguien entre la gente. As\u00ed que no voy a aceptar eso. No tengo que hacer eso. Los otros pol\u00edticos toman d\u00f3lares de las personas por las que tendr\u00e1n que responder.\u00bfNo tiene que responder ante tus donantes? \u00bfNo lo har\u00e1n responsable de ninguna promesa?Yo no hago eso, respondo directamente a la gente. Pero hay algunas personas [que] no necesitan estar en la contienda, porque no tienen dinero. Solo te lo digo claramente. Cuesta mucho dinero aqu\u00ed. Necesitan estar en casa tratando de cuidar a sus familias y esperar hasta su hora. Ahora pueden tomarlo prestado, tampoco estoy criticando eso. Solo digo que estoy en una posici\u00f3n en la que no tengo que hacerlo.No quiero volver a ser esclavo como sal\u00ed de la esclavitud en el Sur. No quiero dinero de nadie. Pagar a mi manera. Mis propios comerciales, hacemos lo nuestro. Y me gusta eso. De esa manera, puedo hablar y decir lo que quiero decir a la c\u00e1mara. Si alguien me dice algo frente a la c\u00e1mara que no me gusta, puedo decirle que no me gusta tu comentario. Pero si alguien m\u00e1s me pag\u00f3, entonces tengo que responder ante un Partido Dem\u00f3crata o un Partido Republicano o cualquier otro partido. No, no tengo que hacer eso.I don\u2019t want to go back in slavery like I came out of slavery down South. I don\u2019t want nobody money. Pay my own way. My own commercials, we do our own thing. And I like that. That way, I can talk and say what I want to say on the camera. If somebody say something to me on camera I don\u2019t like, I can just tell them I don\u2019t like your remark. But if somebody else done paid me, then I got to answer to a Democratic Party or a Republican Party or any other party. Nah, I don\u2019t have to do that."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Willie Wilson",
  "text": "Dr. Willie Wilson ain\u2019t changing for nobody. As a product of the Great Migration myself, it\u2019s that part of him many find most respectable. Born in Louisiana in 1948, he worked alongside his parents as sharecroppers. He landed on Chicago\u2019s West Side in 1965. He worked odd jobs until getting hired at McDonald\u2019s. He crossed picket lines to get promoted to manager and went on to become one of the first African Americans to own a McDonald\u2019s franchise which set him on a path to become a self-made millionaire who today gives thousands of dollars to the community.\u201cBusiness, I\u2019ve pretty much did that and I don\u2019t want no more business. We can give away $10 million, $5 million to the community in a year, whatever we can afford to do,\u201d Wilson told The TRiiBE. \u201cBut if you in government as mayor of the city of Chicago, you can make sure there\u2019s equal opportunity, equality for all citizens, without leaving anybody behind because of the color of your skin.\u201dAs part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series, Wilson invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 2 to his downtown Chicago penthouse, an opulent 46th-floor campaign HQ with 180-degree views of Lake Michigan. Initially he thought we were \u201cthe bourgeois,\u201d and jokingly said he planned to be short with us.\u00a0But when he heard about my West Side roots, he let his guard down and spoke more easily. \u201cThe bread and butter of Chicago, especially people my age, they basically from Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Alabama,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a different world now. I mean, people\u2019s different. What do you call the younger people? Progressive? We never looked at nothing progressive. We was just regular people,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI decided to stay the same and not change. Chicago, I\u2019m \u2018gon stay Louisiana. That\u2019s who I remain today. Louisiana.\u201dWilson\u2019s immutability is the part of him that voters should consider when choosing Chicago\u2019s next mayor.\u00a0In the public safety section of our interview, Wilson said, if elected, he would call for more policing; he\u2019s also specifically said \u201cWe need to take the handcuffs off the police\u201d at his summer 2022 safety platform announcement and that police should \u201chunt them down like a rabbit,\u201d referring to suspects, at a Jan. 19 mayoral debate. That comes as no surprise: the FOP endorsed his 2020 U.S. Senate run, and it\u2019s been reported that Wilson sought the FOP endorsement this time around, but Paul Vallas got it.Throughout our interview, when asked questions about public safety policies such as the SAFE-T Act and Treatment Not Trauma, Wilson indicated he either hasn\u2019t read up on it or was altogether unfamiliar with it.(This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: Your story is one that many older Black Chicagoans relate to. How did your environment growing up shape who you are today, your politics, and your outlook on life?Willie: Being from down South set the foundation for the rest of my life. It taught me how to work, respect, and integrity. Down South, we wave at everybody. You could walk down South and someone got a house here, and you literally could walk in and sit down and start eating. Everybody was welcomed. There was no lock on doors. There was a latch, but that was only for the wind. And there was no contracts to sign. We were sharecroppers. We just trusted everybody.And nobody got killed in my community down South by a break-in or firearm. Nobody. Everybody died [of] natural causes. That was it.From your public appearances across Chicago, it is very clear that many on the South, North and West sides connect with you. Why do you think that is?The people that are my age related to me because we have a lot in common together. Now, we have some of the young people. We got some of the middle-aged people. They related because I believe that we have set the example of what people should be about. They should be about helping one another and not one for self. We work hard. Got some Fortune 500 company like McDonald\u2019s. Everything we have, we work hard for. We didn\u2019t get it by misusing other people. \n\nI think young people look at, like, to have someone to think about and care about them too. I think whether you progressive, senior citizen, or coming up as a kid, everybody wants to be cared for.\nI think young people look at, like, to have someone to think about and care about them too. I think whether you progressive, senior citizen, or coming up as a kid, everybody wants to be cared for.In the streets, a lot of young guys respect you and the work you\u2019re doing, especially the charitable events that you\u2019ve hosted for the gas and food giveaways. What\u2019s your connection to young folks in Chicago?I\u2019ve helped a lot of people get out of jail for misdemeanor and non-violent. They were sitting in there for two, three months. A year. They ain\u2019t even have [a] trial. They ain\u2019t even been to court. I don\u2019t know how much money I took. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I didn\u2019t know not one person. We went in there and we took my attorney and we bailed them out. We felt that was wrong to keep somebody in jail for that long for misdemeanor, non-violent. Couldn\u2019t even afford a lawyer. I think that had a lot to do with it.And another [thing] is caring, in terms of the gas giveaway, the food giveaway. We been doing this since 35, 40 years. We been giving away, maybe not gas so much, but paying people\u2019s property taxes and keeping people out of jail, helping churches, buying food. We\u2019ve spent $60 million, $70 million, $80 million.\u00a0When I got into politics, everybody wanted to say I\u2019m doing ulterior motives. But the people know who I am. There\u2019s some people [who] also hate me too, for the good that we do. I\u2019m not perfect. In order to help other people, particularly our particular people, you\u2019ve got to graduate. And I say graduate because you\u2019ve got to be misused, mistreated when you do good. You got to walk alone. You got to be spit on. You got to be called names. I call that graduating. Some of the same people that said they dislike me, or say I talk a certain way, were in lines for gasoline.You face a lot of pushback because of the way you talk and your accent?Yes. But I don\u2019t pay no mind to it. Always tell people this way; I sign the front of my check. They sign the back of theirs. They working for somebody else. I work for myself. I can live wherever I wanna, do what I wanna do. I don\u2019t have to take commercial flight. I go private plane. I can go wherever I wanna go, wherever money can take me to. They can\u2019t even get out of Chicago.I call some of them bourgeois. I have very little respect for bourgeois. Why? Because they don\u2019t help nobody but themselves. All the people in Chicago got so much money, and not lift one finger to help nobody. And I don\u2019t respect that, nor do I care about them.You mentioned that you bailed people out of jail. How do you feel about the SAFE-T Act? Is that something you support?It\u2019s had some ups and downs to it. I haven\u2019t looked at it personally. I haven\u2019t given a lot of thought to it. But again, there [are] some things that may be good in there. I haven\u2019t read it all personally. And there [are] some things may be bad in there.In 2019, you campaigned on reducing violence by putting jobs back in the community. And then in summer 2022, during a press conference where you announced your policy platforms, you said we must stop young people and gangbangers from polarizing our community by locking them up. You said, \u201cand if the state\u2019s attorney or anybody lets them out, we\u2019ll just lock them up again.\u201d Has your policy around safety changed over the last few years? If so, can you clarify what your policy is now, especially when it comes to Black neighborhoods in Chicago?I don\u2019t care what color you are. I\u2019m thinking about the one who commits the crime.My policy have not changed. I\u2019m \u2018gon lock \u2018em up. And they get out again, we\u2019ll lock \u2018em back up. Because crime has no color.I was at a service station myself and went to get some water. Came out, they broke in my car. I let them take what they want. I didn\u2019t go back out there because I didn\u2019t want any of them causing problems. If you are African American, white, Latina, Asian American, I don\u2019t care about color. Crime has no bearing because you took somebody\u2019s life. What right do you have?Do you feel that there\u2019s a correlation between mental health and violence in Chicago? If so, how are you thinking about that correlation as you draft policies?First of all, people say I have mental problems by giving away [the] money we give away. I think we need to open up some clinics. I don\u2019t think our policemen should be locking up people that have mental illness problems. I think those got to be professional people. If you look at the police department, they arrest a lot of people who are mentally ill. They\u2019re not trained for that. Open up 25, 50 or 30 mental illness [clinics].Why don\u2019t you use some of our churches and create economic empowerment within that? Some of our churches got all kinds of room.\u00a0My 14-year-old niece, I think she was 14 or 15, committed suicide four months ago. That\u2019s a serious problem that should not be dealt with [by] our police officers. Let them use their time for working on what they need to be doing. But even with the police department, we got to find places for them too.A lot of people go back in Cook County Jail because they can get three meals a day. Some of them want to stop using drugs. They got a good drug center. It\u2019s a cycle.Are there any parts of Treatment Not Trauma that you support when it comes to mental health and safety?No, not that I know of. All I know about mental illness is that we need to open up the mental [health] clinic; whether they\u2019re into the school, hospital, police office, anyplace else. Any other name that you may call it, I\u2019m not familiar with that.You want to put trades in the curriculum for CPS students. What exactly does that look like? How does a mayor go about implementing a curriculum change? How much money goes into that?Well, they find money to fund everything else. I mean, they find money for people coming to the city. They find it to let major corporations come into the city.As mayor, where would you pull the money from?Use money that you already have. It\u2019s about managing your budget. It\u2019s about bidding out the contract. But most of the same people that own those contracts get them year after year. They never bid them out. Those dollars there, alright.Then you got new businesses that comes in too. You take, like, the percentage. Put line items, like every month, we got to pay our rent out [of] our paycheck. That\u2019s a line item. So those kind of dollars. What could\u2019ve been a good thing to use is some of the COVID money.You got to deal with the red-light cameras. That\u2019ll make people go out of this city. Businesses don\u2019t want to come in and be in the city because [their customers are discouraged]. The customers out there in Oakbrook or in Indiana, they go there and buy their gasoline and stuff like that. So you start eliminating those barriers then people going to shop more in the city of Chicago. Those dollars gon\u2019 come just from that.You\u2019ve been here since 1965. You\u2019ve talked about how communities like North Lawndale still look the same today as they did after the riots in 1968. What policies will you create to uplift Black neighborhoods that are still in a state of despair, so that they have the same resources that downtown Chicago has?The situation is making sure we get an infrastructure in place. Putting those trades into high schools, elementary schools. Use some of our existing churches and community centers. Put a trade school in those as well.\u00a0Ask the major corporations that we have in Chicago, and reach out to them too, and ask them [to] train some people within that major corporation and do some type of tax incentive break. We\u2019ll get that done.I came to Chicago in 1965. I was at 223 N. Leamington. And I also lived at 2141 S. Lawndale. So I know about Lawndale. I know about the West Side. I didn\u2019t spend too much time on the South Side, but I\u2019m a West Sider since 1965.\u00a0So I think that, what has happened is that, we have to face the fact that we taught our kids that you need to finish high school. But we need to go on from high school. We need to get on and finish college. But the failure that I think we all [have] done as parents, we failed them to say you need a trade along with the high-school diploma or the college degree.How do we build up our communities without displacing the Black people who live there and giving the community a new name? There are some people around the Obama Presidential Center who are being forced out by landlords and new developments pricing them out.A lot of us leave out of Chicago because of the crime. A lot of us leave out of Chicago because of the taxes.The rent is going higher. In something like that, the library, before they put anything in anybody\u2019s community, they should check with the community and it should be at the community request. For example, like the casino that\u2019s coming in up here in Chicago, the community don\u2019t want it there. I wouldn\u2019t have put it there. I would have put it at the McCormick Place. Infrastructure\u2019s already in place there.We have to communicate with our citizens. Because if you don\u2019t communicate with our citizens, you\u2019re out of luck.I will fight and make sure these taxes get down. We got the line item in them, that nobody loses their home until they get back on their feet; kind of like COVID-19. [With] COVID-19, they took care of that eventually. They stopped everybody from working and when they stopped everybody from working, they brought these COVID-19 dollars in. You can find and do what you want to do if you want to do it, when you want to do it, and if you have the heart to do it.You\u2019ve talked about supporting a livable wage. You\u2019ve become wealthy and successful yourself off the growth of businesses, especially with the McDonald\u2019s franchises. Have you implemented a livable wage within your own businesses? How will you support Chicago workers and unions who are fighting for a livable wage and better working conditions today?My average pay for my employees, I believe it\u2019s a little over minimum wage. I would hope so. My average employee that works for me makes about over $100,000 a year. Can you say which business?All of them. That\u2019s my average. So there may be a couple maybe making $70,000. But most of them make $300,000, $200,000, $150,000. So the average comes up.What about your McDonald\u2019s franchises?No. McDonald\u2019s is totally different. We\u2019re a franchisee. McDonald\u2019s Corporation is who owns the land. We own the franchise. It\u2019s kind of like we pay rent.At the time of this interview, there isn\u2019t a good list of your platforms and policies on your campaign website. If a Chicago voter wants to learn more about your platforms, about your policies, how can they do so?Well, they go to my Willie Wilson Facebook. I think you\u2019ll find a lot of stuff there. You do your research on me. Google my name. I\u2019m there. I\u2019m well known in the neighborhood. Everybody knows what we stand for.But a lot of candidates do have their platforms written out on a website or other mediums\u00a0 to read through what their plans areWe have our handout. Everything is on that as well. We\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of interviews. We do live townhall meetings. I\u2019m not what you call the \u201caverage candidate.\u201dI\u2019m not going to be, nor will I receive a paycheck. I\u2019m not \u2018gon take $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 because then I\u2019m working for somebody in between the people. So I\u2019m not \u2018gon take that. I don\u2019t have to do that. The other politicians take dollars from people that they \u2018gon have to answer for.You don\u2019t have to answer to your donors? They won\u2019t hold you accountable to any promises?I don\u2019t do that. I answer straight to the people. But there are some people [who] don\u2019t need to be in the race, because they ain\u2019t got no money. I\u2019m just telling you point blank. It costs a lot of money out here. They need to be at home trying to take care of their families and wait til their time. Now they can borrow it \u2014 I\u2019m not knocking that either. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m in a position where I don\u2019t have to do it.I don\u2019t want to go back in slavery like I came out of slavery down South. I don\u2019t want nobody money. Pay my own way. My own commercials, we do our own thing. And I like that. That way, I can talk and say what I want to say on the camera. If somebody say something to me on camera I don\u2019t like, I can just tell them I don\u2019t like your remark. But if somebody else done paid me, then I got to answer to a Democratic Party or a Republican Party or any other party. Nah, I don\u2019t have to do that."

  "title": "Lightfoot calls CPS teacher emails a \u2018mistake\u2019",
  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired. Lightfoot said doing so would be the easy political thing to do but explained that it wasn\u2019t the appropriate action to take. Instead, she\u2019s calling what happened a teachable moment.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I\u2019m a role model to young women across the city, and I have an obligation given that to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to teach and mentor,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to learn and for me to be a mentor and nurture her,\u201d she added.\u00a0Also, on Thursday, the City Colleges of Chicago confirmed receiving an email from Lightfoot\u2019s campaign last August seeking student volunteers.\u201cCity Colleges staff notified the campaign of CCC\u2019s ethics policy and purged the emails from CCC accounts. City Colleges is not aware of having received subsequent campaign emails but is looking into the matter,\u201d the statement reads.\u00a0On Wednesday evening, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s campaign came under fire after asking Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage students to help her get re-elected in exchange for school credit. WTTW Politics Reporter Heather Cherone first reported the story.\u00a0\u201cLate yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to the campaign . . . a campaign staffer accessed publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a one-on-one interview with The TRiiBE before a Thursday afternoon press conference. \u201cObviously, that was a mistake. From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "text": "An audio recording allegedly between Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant Rickey Hendon and a volunteer for Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s campaign has leaked \u2014 and the talk details a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson.Green is also accusing Wilson of violating the residency requirements to run for Chicago mayor, claiming Wilson\u2019s main home is in south suburban Hazel Crest. The two candidates have a history dating back to at least the 2019 Chicago municipal election, when Hendon \u2014 who was Wilson\u2019s campaign advisor at the time \u2014 challenged Green\u2019s petitions. After that, Green clashed with Hendon, with Hendon later posting on Facebook that he and Green exchanged threats about fighting one another.\u00a0\u201cIf you withdraw, I will take care of you. And you can tell me how much you would need,\u201d Hendon, a former state senator and Chicago alder (27th Ward), allegedly said on the recent phone call. That audio was released on Thursday.\u00a0Chicago-based What\u2019s the Word TV was the first media outlet to publish the full recording on its Instagram page on Thursday morning. What\u2019s the Word TV has since removed the video, although The TRiiBE has retained the audio and video. (Read the full transcript below.)\u00a0Additionally, Chicago-based blog Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s posted the video on its Instagram page, and it was still up at publishing time.\u201cYou know, don\u2019t nobody want you to lose money, you know, \u2018cause Ja\u2019Mal ain\u2019t \u2018gon be on the ballot, bro. I wouldn\u2019t do that shit,\u201d Hendon allegedly continued on the call. He also mentioned Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), who is also in the 2023 race for mayor.\u201cSawyer ain\u2019t gon be on the ballot,\u201d Hendon allegedly said. \u201cI never miss. Don\u2019t shoot if I\u2019ma miss.\u201dIn a response to The TRiiBE, Wilson\u2019s campaign spokesperson Richard Boykin confirmed that Hendon\u2019s voice is on the recording.\u201cThe comments made by former Sen. Rickey Hendon were not authorized by me or my campaign. This is a personal issue between Sen. Hendon and Mr. Green,\u201d Boykin wrote in a press release on Thursday.In a press release issued at 4:45 p.m. on Thursday, Green\u2019s team identified the volunteer on the call as Kevin Hobby and acknowledged the conversation. Green said, \u201cI\u2019m glad someone was able to capture the corrupt openness Ricky has. Let me just say that the old way of politics is pulling some desperate moves to drag me and my campaign down, going so far as to offer financial compensation to my ally. This city\u2019s corrupt nature shows its face almost out in the open now. The sleazy deals, the open bribery, the big money talking \u2014 it needs to end! That\u2019s why I am running for mayor in the first place.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s time for the new generation of leadership, if the audio didn\u2019t prove it then I\u2019m not sure what will.\u201dIllinois law makes it a felony to intercept, record or transcribe any private telephone or electronic communication unless all parties consent. The TRiiBE has not yet been able to verify if the conversation was recorded legally.\n        \u201cWe should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a South Side resident.According to Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, businessman Wilson and community activist and entrepreneur Green are attempting to rid the current 11-candidate field of the other, while Wilson also filed a separate challenge to Sawyer. Other candidates are seeking to knock off long-shot candidates Frederick Collins and Johnny Logalbo.TRANSCRIPT:Rickey Hendon: And I ain\u2019t even gotta tell you, you know. The lines, we both know y\u2019all weren\u2019t in there looking at them [unintelligible] lines. So Willie\u2019s gonna make it. Ja\u2019Mal is not. Why you have to suffer? We can work something out.

And I\u2019ll look out for you.\u00a0Kevin Hobby: Mmhm.Rickey Hendon: I don\u2019t like putting, you know, amounts and stuff. We are talking on the phone. But you can tell me, \u2018Look. OK.

  "text": "El Dr. Willie Wilson no cambiar\u00e1 por nadie. Como producto de la Gran Migraci\u00f3n, es esa parte de \u00e9l que muchos encuentran m\u00e1s respetable. Nacido en Luisiana en 1948, trabaj\u00f3 junto a sus padres como aparceros. Aterriz\u00f3 en el West Side de Chicago en 1965. Trabaj\u00f3 en trabajos ocasionales hasta que lo contrataron en McDonald\u2019s. Cruz\u00f3 la l\u00ednea de piquetes para ser ascendido a gerente y se convirti\u00f3 en uno de los primeros afroamericanos en ser due\u00f1o de una franquicia de McDonald\u2019s, lo que lo coloc\u00f3 en el camino para convertirse en un millonario hecho por s\u00ed mismo que hoy da miles de d\u00f3lares a la comunidad.\u201cNegocios, pr\u00e1cticamente he hecho eso y no quiero m\u00e1s negocios. Podemos regalar $10 millones, $5 millones a la comunidad en un a\u00f1o, lo que podamos hacer\u201d, dijo Wilson a The TRiiBE . \u201cPero si est\u00e1s en el gobierno como alcalde de la ciudad de Chicago, puedes asegurarte de que haya igualdad de oportunidades, igualdad para todos los ciudadanos, sin dejar a nadie atr\u00e1s por el color de su piel\u201d.Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos para alcalde del 2023, Before the Polls, Wilson invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 2 de enero a su penthouse en el centro de Chicago, un opulento cuartel general de campa\u00f1a en el piso 46 con vistas de 180 grados del lago Michigan. Inicialmente pens\u00f3 que \u00e9ramos \u201clos burgueses\u201d, y bromeando dijo que planeaba ser breve con nosotros.\u00a0Pero cuando se enter\u00f3 de mis ra\u00edces en el West Side, baj\u00f3 la guardia y habl\u00f3 con m\u00e1s tranquilidad. \u201cEl pan y la mantequilla de Chicago, especialmente la gente de mi edad, son b\u00e1sicamente de Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas y Alabama\u201d, dijo.\u201cEs un mundo diferente ahora. Quiero decir, la gente es diferente. \u00bfC\u00f3mo llamas a los j\u00f3venes? \u00bfProgresivos? Nunca miramos nada progresista. Solo \u00e9ramos personas normales\u201d, dijo Wilson. \u201cDecid\u00ed quedarme igual y no cambiar. Chicago, me quedar\u00e9 con mis costumbres de Luisiana. Eso es lo que sigo siendo hoy. Luisiana.\u201dLa inmutabilidad de Wilson es la parte de \u00e9l que los votantes deber\u00edan considerar al elegir al pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago.\u00a0En la secci\u00f3n de seguridad p\u00fablica de nuestra entrevista, Wilson dijo que, de ser elegido, pedir\u00eda m\u00e1s vigilancia; tambi\u00e9n dijo espec\u00edficamente \u201cTenemos que quitarle las esposas a la polic\u00eda\u201d en su anuncio de la plataforma de seguridad del verano del 2022 y que la polic\u00eda deber\u00eda \u201ccazarlos como si fueran conejos\u201d, refiri\u00e9ndose a los sospechosos, en un debate de alcaldes el 19 de enero. Eso no es sorprendente: la FOP respald\u00f3 su candidatura al Senado de los EE.UU. del 2020, y se inform\u00f3 que Wilson busc\u00f3 el respaldo de la FOP esta vez, pero Paul Vallas lo obtuvo.A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, cuando se le hicieron preguntas sobre las pol\u00edticas de seguridad p\u00fablica, como la Ley SAFE-T y el Tratamiento, no el Trauma, Wilson indic\u00f3 que no hab\u00eda le\u00eddo nada al respecto o que no estaba familiarizado con \u00e9l.(Esta entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: Su historia es una con la que muchas personas mayores Negras de Chicago se identifican. \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 su crecimiento en su entorno a qui\u00e9n es usted hoy, su pol\u00edtica y su visi\u00f3n de la vida?Willie: Ser del sur sent\u00f3 las bases para el resto de mi vida. Me ense\u00f1\u00f3 a trabajar, respeto e integridad. Hacia el sur, saludamos a todo el mundo. Podr\u00edas caminar por el sur y alguien conseguir\u00eda una casa aqu\u00ed, y literalmente podr\u00edas entrar, sentarte y empezar a comer. Todos ser\u00edan bienvenidos. No habr\u00eda cerradura en las puertas. Habr\u00eda un pestillo, pero eso era solo para el viento. Y no habr\u00eda contratos que firmar. \u00c9ramos aparceros. Simplemente confiamos en todos.Y nadie muri\u00f3 en mi comunidad en el sur por un allanamiento o un arma de fuego. Nadie. Todo el mundo muri\u00f3 [de] causas naturales. Eso fue todo.De sus apariciones p\u00fablicas en Chicago, est\u00e1 muy claro que muchos en los lados del sur, norte y oeste de la ciudad se conectan con usted. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 cree que es as\u00ed?Las personas de mi edad se relacionan conmigo porque tenemos mucho en com\u00fan. Ahora, tenemos algunos de los j\u00f3venes. Tenemos algunas de las personas de mediana edad. Se relacionaron porque creo que hemos dado el ejemplo de lo que deber\u00eda ser la gente. Deben tratar de ayudarse unos a otros y no uno solo. Trabajamos duro. Tengo una compa\u00f1\u00eda Fortune 500 como McDonald's. Todo lo que tenemos, trabajamos arduamente para obtenerlo. No lo conseguimos abusando de otras personas. Creo que los j\u00f3venes buscan tener a alguien en quien pensar y que se preocupe por ellos tambi\u00e9n. Creo que ya seas un progresista, un anciano o un ni\u00f1e, todos quieren que los cuiden.Creo que los j\u00f3venes buscan tener a alguien en quien pensar y que se preocupe por ellos tambi\u00e9n. Creo que ya seas un progresista, un anciano o un ni\u00f1e, todos quieren que los cuiden.En las calles, muchos j\u00f3venes lo respetan a usted y al trabajo que est\u00e1s haciendo, especialmente los eventos ben\u00e9ficos que ha organizado para los obsequios de gasolina y comida. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es su conexi\u00f3n con los j\u00f3venes de Chicago?He ayudado a mucha gente a salir de la c\u00e1rcel por delitos menores y no violentos. Estuvieron sentados all\u00ed durante dos, tres meses. Un a\u00f1o. Ni siquiera tienen [un] juicio. Ni siquiera han ido a la corte. No s\u00e9 cu\u00e1nto dinero tom\u00e9. Fueron cientos de miles de d\u00f3lares. Y no conoc\u00eda a nadie. Entramos all\u00ed y trajimos a mi abogado y los rescatamos. Sentimos que estaba mal mantener a alguien en la c\u00e1rcel por tanto tiempo por un delito menor, no violento. Ni siquiera pod\u00edan pagar un abogado. Creo que eso tuvo mucho que ver.Y otra [cosa] es el cuidado, en cuanto al sorteo de gasolina, el sorteo de comida. Llevamos haciendo esto desde hace 35, 40 a\u00f1os. Hemos estado regalando, tal vez no tanta gasolina, pero pagando los impuestos a la propiedad de las personas y manteniendo a las personas fuera de la c\u00e1rcel, ayudando a las iglesias, comprando alimentos. Hemos gastado $60 millones, $70 millones, $80 millones.\u00a0Cuando me met\u00ed en la pol\u00edtica, todos quer\u00edan decir que lo hago por motivos ocultos. Pero la gente sabe qui\u00e9n soy. Hay algunas personas [que] tambi\u00e9n me odian, por el bien que hacemos. No soy perfecto. Para ayudar a otras personas, particularmente a nuestra gente en particular, tienes que graduarte. Y digo graduarme porque hay que maltratarte, maltratarte cuando haces el bien. Tienes que caminar solo. Tienes que ser escupido. Tienes que ser llamado nombres. A eso lo llamo graduarse. Algunas de las mismas personas que dijeron que no les ca\u00eda bien, o que hablo de cierta manera, estaban en fila para recibir gasolina.\u00bfTe enfrentas a muchas cr\u00edticas por tu forma de hablar y tu acento?S\u00ed. Pero no le doy importancia. Siempre dile a la gente de esta manera; Firmo el frente de mi cheque. Ellos firman el reverso de los suyos. Ellos trabajan para otra persona. Trabajo para mi mismo. Puedo vivir donde quiera, hacer lo que quiera hacer. No tengo que tomar un vuelo comercial. Voy en avi\u00f3n privado. Puedo ir a donde quiera ir, donde quiera que me lleve el dinero. Ni siquiera pueden salir de Chicago.Llamo a algunos de ellos burgueses. Tengo muy poco respeto por los burgueses. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque no ayudan a nadie m\u00e1s que a s\u00ed mismos. Toda la gente de Chicago tiene mucho dinero y no mueve un dedo para ayudar a nadie. Y no respeto eso, ni me preocupo por ellos.Menciono que sacaste gente de la c\u00e1rcel bajo fianza. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente acerca de la Ley SAFE-T? \u00bfEs algo que apoyas?Ha tenido algunos altibajos. No lo he mirado personalmente. No he pensado mucho en ello. Pero nuevamente, [hay] algunas cosas que pueden ser buenas all\u00ed. No lo he le\u00eddo todo personalmente. Y hay algunas cosas que pueden estar mal all\u00ed.En 2019, hizo campa\u00f1a para reducir la violencia al restablecer los empleos en la comunidad. Y luego, en el verano del 2022, durante una conferencia de prensa en la que anunci\u00f3 sus plataformas pol\u00edticas, dijo que debemos evitar que los j\u00f3venes y los pandilleros polaricen nuestra comunidad encerr\u00e1ndolos. Dijo, \"y si el fiscal del estado o alguien los deja salir, simplemente los encerraremos de nuevo\". \u00bfHa cambiado su pol\u00edtica de seguridad en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfpuede aclarar cu\u00e1l es su pol\u00edtica ahora, especialmente cuando se trata de vecindarios Negros en Chicago?No me importa de qu\u00e9 color eres. Estoy pensando en el que comete el crimen. Mi pol\u00edtica no ha cambiado. Voy a encerrarlos. Y vuelven a salir, los encerramos de nuevo. Porque el crimen no tiene color.Yo mismo estaba en una estaci\u00f3n de servicio y fui a buscar agua. Sal\u00ed, y hab\u00edan robado mi carro. Los deje tomar lo que quer\u00edan. No volv\u00ed a salir porque no quer\u00eda que ninguno de ellos causara problemas. Si eres afroamericano, blanco, latine, asi\u00e1tico americano, no me importa el color. El crimen no se defiende porque le quitaste la vida a alguien. \u00bfQu\u00e9 derecho tienes?\u00bfCree que existe una correlaci\u00f3n entre la salud mental y la violencia en Chicago? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo piensa acerca de esa correlaci\u00f3n al redactar pol\u00edticas?En primer lugar, la gente dice que tengo problemas mentales al regalar [el] dinero que regalamos. Creo que tenemos que abrir algunas cl\u00ednicas. No creo que nuestros polic\u00edas deban encerrar a personas que tienen problemas de enfermedades mentales. Creo que esos tienen que ser gente profesional. Si nos fijamos en el departamento de polic\u00eda, arrestan a muchas personas con enfermedades mentales. No est\u00e1n entrenados para eso. Abrir 25, 50 o 30 [cl\u00ednicas] para enfermedades mentales.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no usan algunas de nuestras iglesias y crean empoderamiento econ\u00f3mico dentro de ellas? Algunas de nuestras iglesias tienen todo tipo de espacio.\u00a0Mi sobrina de 14 a\u00f1os, creo que ten\u00eda 14 o 15, se suicid\u00f3 hace cuatro meses. Ese es un problema serio que no debe ser tratado [por] nuestros polic\u00edas. Perm\u00edtales usar su tiempo para trabajar en lo que necesitan hacer. Pero incluso con el departamento de polic\u00eda, tambi\u00e9n tenemos que encontrar lugares para ellos.Muchas personas regresan a la c\u00e1rcel del condado de Cook porque pueden recibir tres comidas al d\u00eda. Algunos de ellos quieren dejar de consumir drogas. Tienen un buen centro de drogas [en la c\u00e1rcel]. Es un ciclo\u00bfHay alguna parte de Tratamiento, No Trauma que apoye en lo que respecta a la salud mental y la seguridad?No, no que yo sepa. Todo lo que s\u00e9 sobre las enfermedades mentales es que necesitamos abrir la cl\u00ednica [de salud] mental; ya sea que est\u00e9n en la escuela, el hospital, la oficina de polic\u00eda, en cualquier otro lugar. Cualquier otro nombre que pueda llamarlo, no estoy familiarizado con eso.Quiere incluir oficios en el plan de estudios para los estudiantes de CPS. \u00bfC\u00f3mo se ve eso exactamente? \u00bfC\u00f3mo hace un alcalde para implementar un cambio curricular? \u00bfCu\u00e1nto dinero se tiene que aportar a eso?Bueno, encuentran dinero para financiar todo lo dem\u00e1s. Es decir, encuentran dinero para la gente que viene a la ciudad. Lo encuentran para permitir que las grandes corporaciones entren en la ciudad.Como alcalde, \u00bfde d\u00f3nde sacar\u00eda el dinero?Usando el dinero que ya tenemos. Se trata de administrar el presupuesto. Se trata de encontrar el mejor precio para el contrato. Pero la mayor\u00eda de las mismas personas que poseen esos contratos los obtienen a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o. Nunca se encontr\u00f3 mejor precios. Esos d\u00f3lares ah\u00ed, bien.Luego tienes nuevos negocios que tambi\u00e9n entran. Uno toma, como, el porcentaje. Se tienen que crear listas de los gastos, como todos los meses, tenemos que pagar nuestra renta [de] nuestro cheque de pago. Eso es algo que va en nuestra lista de gastos. As\u00ed que ese tipo de d\u00f3lares. Lo que podr\u00eda haber sido algo bueno para usar es parte del dinero de COVID.Tienes que lidiar con las c\u00e1maras de luz roja. Eso har\u00e1 que la gente se vaya de esta ciudad. Las empresas no quieren entrar y estar en la ciudad porque [sus clientes est\u00e1n desanimados]. Los clientes de Oakbrook o de Indiana van all\u00ed y compran gasolina y cosas por el estilo. As\u00ed que empiezas a eliminar esas barreras y luego la gente va a comprar m\u00e1s en la ciudad de Chicago. Esos d\u00f3lares van a salir solo de eso.Usted ha estado aqu\u00ed desde 1965. Ha hablado sobre c\u00f3mo comunidades como North Lawndale todav\u00eda se ven igual hoy que despu\u00e9s de los disturbios en 1968. \u00bfQu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas crear\u00e1 para mejorar los vecindarios Negros que todav\u00eda est\u00e1n en un estado de desesperaci\u00f3n, para que tengan los mismos recursos que tiene el centro de Chicago?La situaci\u00f3n es asegurarnos de que tengamos una infraestructura en su lugar. Poner esos oficios en las escuelas secundarias, escuelas primarias. Usar algunas de nuestras iglesias y centros comunitarios existentes. Poner una escuela de donde se aprender trabajos de mano de hobra en las escuelas tambi\u00e9n.\u00a0Preguntar a las grandes corporaciones que tenemos en Chicago, comun\u00edcarse con ellas tambi\u00e9n y pedirles [que] capaciten a algunas personas dentro de esa gran corporaci\u00f3n y que hagan alg\u00fan tipo de incentivo fiscal. Lo haremos.Vine a Chicago en 1965. Estaba en 223 N. Leamington. Y tambi\u00e9n viv\u00ed en 2141 S. Lawndale. As\u00ed que s\u00e9 sobre Lawndale. Conozco el West Side. No pas\u00e9 demasiado tiempo en el South Side, pero soy del West Side desde 1965.\u00a0Entonces creo que lo que ha pasado es que tenemos que enfrentar el hecho de que hemos ense\u00f1ado a nuestros hijos que deben terminar la escuela secundaria. Pero tenemos que seguir mas alla de la secundaria. Necesitamos continuar y terminar la universidad. Pero el fracaso que creo que todos [hemos] hecho como padres, les fallamos al decir que necesitas un oficio junto con el diploma de escuela secundaria o el t\u00edtulo universitario.\u00bfC\u00f3mo construimos nuestras comunidades sin desplazar a la gente Negra que viven all\u00ed y darle un nuevo nombre a la comunidad? Hay algunas personas alrededor del Centro Presidencial de Obama que est\u00e1n siendo expulsadas por los propietarios y los nuevos desarrollos que son muy costosos y los llevan a tener que tomar la decision de irse.Muchos de nosotros nos vamos de Chicago debido al crimen. Muchos de nosotros nos vamos de Chicago por los impuestos.Las rentas siguen subiendo m\u00e1s alto. En algo as\u00ed, la biblioteca, antes de poner algo en la comunidad de alguien, debe consultar con la comunidad y debe ser a pedido de la comunidad. Por ejemplo, como el casino que se est\u00e1 construyendo aqu\u00ed en Chicago, la comunidad no lo quiere all\u00ed. Yo no lo hubiera puesto ah\u00ed. Lo habr\u00eda puesto en McCormick Place. La infraestructura ya est\u00e1 instalada all\u00ed.Tenemos que comunicarnos con nuestros ciudadanos. Porque si no te comunicas con nuestros ciudadanos, no tienes suerte.Luchar\u00e9 y me asegurar\u00e9 de que estos impuestos se reduzcan. Tenemos la l\u00ednea de pedido en ellos, que nadie pierde su hogar hasta que se recupere; algo as\u00ed como COVID-19. [Con] COVID-19, eventualmente se encargaron de eso. Impidieron que todos trabajaran y cuando impidieron que todos trabajaran, trajeron estos d\u00f3lares de COVID-19. Uno puede encontrar y hacer lo que uno quiere hacer si uno quiere hacerlo, cu\u00e1ndo uno quiera hacerlo y si tiene uno el coraz\u00f3n para hacerlo.Ha hablado de apoyar un salario digno. Se ha vuelto rico y exitoso gracias al crecimiento de los negocios, especialmente con las franquicias de McDonald's. \u00bfHa implementado un salario digno dentro de sus propios negocios? \u00bfC\u00f3mo apoyar\u00e1 a los trabajadores y sindicatos de Chicago que luchan hoy por un salario digno y mejores condiciones de trabajo?Mi salario promedio para mis empleados, creo que est\u00e1 un poco por encima del salario m\u00ednimo. Yo esperaria. Mi empleado promedio que trabaja para m\u00ed gana alrededor de $100,000 al a\u00f1o.\u00bfPuede decir qu\u00e9 negocio?Todos ellos. Ese es mi promedio. As\u00ed que puede haber una pareja que tal vez gane $70,000. Pero la mayor\u00eda gana $300,000, $200,000, $150,000. As\u00ed que sale el promedio.\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa con sus franquicias de McDonald's?No. McDonald's es totalmente diferente. Somos un franquiciado. McDonald's Corporation es la propietaria de la tierra. Somos due\u00f1os de la franquicia. Es como si pag\u00e1ramos renta.En el momento de esta entrevista, no hay una buena lista de sus plataformas y pol\u00edticas en el sitio web de su campa\u00f1a. Si un votante de Chicago quiere aprender m\u00e1s sobre su campa\u00f1a, sobre sus pol\u00edticas, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede hacerlo?Bueno, van a mi Facebook de Willie Wilson. Creo que encontrar\u00e1s muchas cosas all\u00ed. Haz tu investigaci\u00f3n sobre m\u00ed. Busca mi nombre en Google. Estoy ah\u00ed. Soy muy conocido en el barrio. Todo el mundo sabe lo que representamos.Pero muchos candidatos tienen sus plataformas escritas en un sitio web u otros medios para leer cu\u00e1les son sus planes.Tenemos nuestro folleto. Todo est\u00e1 all\u00ed tambi\u00e9n. Tenemos miles y miles de entrevistas. Hacemos reuniones. No soy lo que llamas el \"candidato regular\". No voy a ser, ni voy a recibir un cheque de pago. No voy a tomar $50,000, $100,000 o $200,000 porque entonces estoy trabajando para alguien entre la gente. As\u00ed que no voy a aceptar eso. No tengo que hacer eso. Los otros pol\u00edticos toman d\u00f3lares de las personas por las que tendr\u00e1n que responder.\u00bfNo tiene que responder ante tus donantes? \u00bfNo lo har\u00e1n responsable de ninguna promesa?Yo no hago eso, respondo directamente a la gente. Pero hay algunas personas [que] no necesitan estar en la contienda, porque no tienen dinero. Solo te lo digo claramente. Cuesta mucho dinero aqu\u00ed. Necesitan estar en casa tratando de cuidar a sus familias y esperar hasta su hora. Ahora pueden tomarlo prestado, tampoco estoy criticando eso. Solo digo que estoy en una posici\u00f3n en la que no tengo que hacerlo.No quiero volver a ser esclavo como sal\u00ed de la esclavitud en el Sur. No quiero dinero de nadie. Pagar a mi manera. Mis propios comerciales, hacemos lo nuestro. Y me gusta eso. De esa manera, puedo hablar y decir lo que quiero decir a la c\u00e1mara. Si alguien me dice algo frente a la c\u00e1mara que no me gusta, puedo decirle que no me gusta tu comentario. Pero si alguien m\u00e1s me pag\u00f3, entonces tengo que responder ante un Partido Dem\u00f3crata o un Partido Republicano o cualquier otro partido. No, no tengo que hacer eso.I don\u2019t want to go back in slavery like I came out of slavery down South. I don\u2019t want nobody money. Pay my own way. My own commercials, we do our own thing. And I like that. That way, I can talk and say what I want to say on the camera. If somebody say something to me on camera I don\u2019t like, I can just tell them I don\u2019t like your remark. But if somebody else done paid me, then I got to answer to a Democratic Party or a Republican Party or any other party. Nah, I don\u2019t have to do that."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Willie Wilson",
  "text": "Dr. Willie Wilson ain\u2019t changing for nobody. As a product of the Great Migration myself, it\u2019s that part of him many find most respectable. Born in Louisiana in 1948, he worked alongside his parents as sharecroppers. He landed on Chicago\u2019s West Side in 1965. He worked odd jobs until getting hired at McDonald\u2019s. He crossed picket lines to get promoted to manager and went on to become one of the first African Americans to own a McDonald\u2019s franchise which set him on a path to become a self-made millionaire who today gives thousands of dollars to the community.\u201cBusiness, I\u2019ve pretty much did that and I don\u2019t want no more business. We can give away $10 million, $5 million to the community in a year, whatever we can afford to do,\u201d Wilson told The TRiiBE. \u201cBut if you in government as mayor of the city of Chicago, you can make sure there\u2019s equal opportunity, equality for all citizens, without leaving anybody behind because of the color of your skin.\u201dAs part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series, Wilson invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 2 to his downtown Chicago penthouse, an opulent 46th-floor campaign HQ with 180-degree views of Lake Michigan. Initially he thought we were \u201cthe bourgeois,\u201d and jokingly said he planned to be short with us.\u00a0But when he heard about my West Side roots, he let his guard down and spoke more easily. \u201cThe bread and butter of Chicago, especially people my age, they basically from Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Alabama,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s a different world now. I mean, people\u2019s different. What do you call the younger people? Progressive? We never looked at nothing progressive. We was just regular people,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI decided to stay the same and not change. Chicago, I\u2019m \u2018gon stay Louisiana. That\u2019s who I remain today. Louisiana.\u201dWilson\u2019s immutability is the part of him that voters should consider when choosing Chicago\u2019s next mayor.\u00a0In the public safety section of our interview, Wilson said, if elected, he would call for more policing; he\u2019s also specifically said \u201cWe need to take the handcuffs off the police\u201d at his summer 2022 safety platform announcement and that police should \u201chunt them down like a rabbit,\u201d referring to suspects, at a Jan. 19 mayoral debate. That comes as no surprise: the FOP endorsed his 2020 U.S. Senate run, and it\u2019s been reported that Wilson sought the FOP endorsement this time around, but Paul Vallas got it.Throughout our interview, when asked questions about public safety policies such as the SAFE-T Act and Treatment Not Trauma, Wilson indicated he either hasn\u2019t read up on it or was altogether unfamiliar with it.(This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: Your story is one that many older Black Chicagoans relate to. How did your environment growing up shape who you are today, your politics, and your outlook on life?Willie: Being from down South set the foundation for the rest of my life. It taught me how to work, respect, and integrity. Down South, we wave at everybody. You could walk down South and someone got a house here, and you literally could walk in and sit down and start eating. Everybody was welcomed. There was no lock on doors. There was a latch, but that was only for the wind. And there was no contracts to sign. We were sharecroppers. We just trusted everybody.And nobody got killed in my community down South by a break-in or firearm. Nobody. Everybody died [of] natural causes. That was it.From your public appearances across Chicago, it is very clear that many on the South, North and West sides connect with you. Why do you think that is?The people that are my age related to me because we have a lot in common together. Now, we have some of the young people. We got some of the middle-aged people. They related because I believe that we have set the example of what people should be about. They should be about helping one another and not one for self. We work hard. Got some Fortune 500 company like McDonald\u2019s. Everything we have, we work hard for. We didn\u2019t get it by misusing other people. \n\nI think young people look at, like, to have someone to think about and care about them too. I think whether you progressive, senior citizen, or coming up as a kid, everybody wants to be cared for.\nI think young people look at, like, to have someone to think about and care about them too. I think whether you progressive, senior citizen, or coming up as a kid, everybody wants to be cared for.In the streets, a lot of young guys respect you and the work you\u2019re doing, especially the charitable events that you\u2019ve hosted for the gas and food giveaways. What\u2019s your connection to young folks in Chicago?I\u2019ve helped a lot of people get out of jail for misdemeanor and non-violent. They were sitting in there for two, three months. A year. They ain\u2019t even have [a] trial. They ain\u2019t even been to court. I don\u2019t know how much money I took. It was hundreds of thousands of dollars. And I didn\u2019t know not one person. We went in there and we took my attorney and we bailed them out. We felt that was wrong to keep somebody in jail for that long for misdemeanor, non-violent. Couldn\u2019t even afford a lawyer. I think that had a lot to do with it.And another [thing] is caring, in terms of the gas giveaway, the food giveaway. We been doing this since 35, 40 years. We been giving away, maybe not gas so much, but paying people\u2019s property taxes and keeping people out of jail, helping churches, buying food. We\u2019ve spent $60 million, $70 million, $80 million.\u00a0When I got into politics, everybody wanted to say I\u2019m doing ulterior motives. But the people know who I am. There\u2019s some people [who] also hate me too, for the good that we do. I\u2019m not perfect. In order to help other people, particularly our particular people, you\u2019ve got to graduate. And I say graduate because you\u2019ve got to be misused, mistreated when you do good. You got to walk alone. You got to be spit on. You got to be called names. I call that graduating. Some of the same people that said they dislike me, or say I talk a certain way, were in lines for gasoline.You face a lot of pushback because of the way you talk and your accent?Yes. But I don\u2019t pay no mind to it. Always tell people this way; I sign the front of my check. They sign the back of theirs. They working for somebody else. I work for myself. I can live wherever I wanna, do what I wanna do. I don\u2019t have to take commercial flight. I go private plane. I can go wherever I wanna go, wherever money can take me to. They can\u2019t even get out of Chicago.I call some of them bourgeois. I have very little respect for bourgeois. Why? Because they don\u2019t help nobody but themselves. All the people in Chicago got so much money, and not lift one finger to help nobody. And I don\u2019t respect that, nor do I care about them.You mentioned that you bailed people out of jail. How do you feel about the SAFE-T Act? Is that something you support?It\u2019s had some ups and downs to it. I haven\u2019t looked at it personally. I haven\u2019t given a lot of thought to it. But again, there [are] some things that may be good in there. I haven\u2019t read it all personally. And there [are] some things may be bad in there.In 2019, you campaigned on reducing violence by putting jobs back in the community. And then in summer 2022, during a press conference where you announced your policy platforms, you said we must stop young people and gangbangers from polarizing our community by locking them up. You said, \u201cand if the state\u2019s attorney or anybody lets them out, we\u2019ll just lock them up again.\u201d Has your policy around safety changed over the last few years? If so, can you clarify what your policy is now, especially when it comes to Black neighborhoods in Chicago?I don\u2019t care what color you are. I\u2019m thinking about the one who commits the crime.My policy have not changed. I\u2019m \u2018gon lock \u2018em up. And they get out again, we\u2019ll lock \u2018em back up. Because crime has no color.I was at a service station myself and went to get some water. Came out, they broke in my car. I let them take what they want. I didn\u2019t go back out there because I didn\u2019t want any of them causing problems. If you are African American, white, Latina, Asian American, I don\u2019t care about color. Crime has no bearing because you took somebody\u2019s life. What right do you have?Do you feel that there\u2019s a correlation between mental health and violence in Chicago? If so, how are you thinking about that correlation as you draft policies?First of all, people say I have mental problems by giving away [the] money we give away. I think we need to open up some clinics. I don\u2019t think our policemen should be locking up people that have mental illness problems. I think those got to be professional people. If you look at the police department, they arrest a lot of people who are mentally ill. They\u2019re not trained for that. Open up 25, 50 or 30 mental illness [clinics].Why don\u2019t you use some of our churches and create economic empowerment within that? Some of our churches got all kinds of room.\u00a0My 14-year-old niece, I think she was 14 or 15, committed suicide four months ago. That\u2019s a serious problem that should not be dealt with [by] our police officers. Let them use their time for working on what they need to be doing. But even with the police department, we got to find places for them too.A lot of people go back in Cook County Jail because they can get three meals a day. Some of them want to stop using drugs. They got a good drug center. It\u2019s a cycle.Are there any parts of Treatment Not Trauma that you support when it comes to mental health and safety?No, not that I know of. All I know about mental illness is that we need to open up the mental [health] clinic; whether they\u2019re into the school, hospital, police office, anyplace else. Any other name that you may call it, I\u2019m not familiar with that.You want to put trades in the curriculum for CPS students. What exactly does that look like? How does a mayor go about implementing a curriculum change? How much money goes into that?Well, they find money to fund everything else. I mean, they find money for people coming to the city. They find it to let major corporations come into the city.As mayor, where would you pull the money from?Use money that you already have. It\u2019s about managing your budget. It\u2019s about bidding out the contract. But most of the same people that own those contracts get them year after year. They never bid them out. Those dollars there, alright.Then you got new businesses that comes in too. You take, like, the percentage. Put line items, like every month, we got to pay our rent out [of] our paycheck. That\u2019s a line item. So those kind of dollars. What could\u2019ve been a good thing to use is some of the COVID money.You got to deal with the red-light cameras. That\u2019ll make people go out of this city. Businesses don\u2019t want to come in and be in the city because [their customers are discouraged]. The customers out there in Oakbrook or in Indiana, they go there and buy their gasoline and stuff like that. So you start eliminating those barriers then people going to shop more in the city of Chicago. Those dollars gon\u2019 come just from that.You\u2019ve been here since 1965. You\u2019ve talked about how communities like North Lawndale still look the same today as they did after the riots in 1968. What policies will you create to uplift Black neighborhoods that are still in a state of despair, so that they have the same resources that downtown Chicago has?The situation is making sure we get an infrastructure in place. Putting those trades into high schools, elementary schools. Use some of our existing churches and community centers. Put a trade school in those as well.\u00a0Ask the major corporations that we have in Chicago, and reach out to them too, and ask them [to] train some people within that major corporation and do some type of tax incentive break. We\u2019ll get that done.I came to Chicago in 1965. I was at 223 N. Leamington. And I also lived at 2141 S. Lawndale. So I know about Lawndale. I know about the West Side. I didn\u2019t spend too much time on the South Side, but I\u2019m a West Sider since 1965.\u00a0So I think that, what has happened is that, we have to face the fact that we taught our kids that you need to finish high school. But we need to go on from high school. We need to get on and finish college. But the failure that I think we all [have] done as parents, we failed them to say you need a trade along with the high-school diploma or the college degree.How do we build up our communities without displacing the Black people who live there and giving the community a new name? There are some people around the Obama Presidential Center who are being forced out by landlords and new developments pricing them out.A lot of us leave out of Chicago because of the crime. A lot of us leave out of Chicago because of the taxes.The rent is going higher. In something like that, the library, before they put anything in anybody\u2019s community, they should check with the community and it should be at the community request. For example, like the casino that\u2019s coming in up here in Chicago, the community don\u2019t want it there. I wouldn\u2019t have put it there. I would have put it at the McCormick Place. Infrastructure\u2019s already in place there.We have to communicate with our citizens. Because if you don\u2019t communicate with our citizens, you\u2019re out of luck.I will fight and make sure these taxes get down. We got the line item in them, that nobody loses their home until they get back on their feet; kind of like COVID-19. [With] COVID-19, they took care of that eventually. They stopped everybody from working and when they stopped everybody from working, they brought these COVID-19 dollars in. You can find and do what you want to do if you want to do it, when you want to do it, and if you have the heart to do it.You\u2019ve talked about supporting a livable wage. You\u2019ve become wealthy and successful yourself off the growth of businesses, especially with the McDonald\u2019s franchises. Have you implemented a livable wage within your own businesses? How will you support Chicago workers and unions who are fighting for a livable wage and better working conditions today?My average pay for my employees, I believe it\u2019s a little over minimum wage. I would hope so. My average employee that works for me makes about over $100,000 a year. Can you say which business?All of them. That\u2019s my average. So there may be a couple maybe making $70,000. But most of them make $300,000, $200,000, $150,000. So the average comes up.What about your McDonald\u2019s franchises?No. McDonald\u2019s is totally different. We\u2019re a franchisee. McDonald\u2019s Corporation is who owns the land. We own the franchise. It\u2019s kind of like we pay rent.At the time of this interview, there isn\u2019t a good list of your platforms and policies on your campaign website. If a Chicago voter wants to learn more about your platforms, about your policies, how can they do so?Well, they go to my Willie Wilson Facebook. I think you\u2019ll find a lot of stuff there. You do your research on me. Google my name. I\u2019m there. I\u2019m well known in the neighborhood. Everybody knows what we stand for.But a lot of candidates do have their platforms written out on a website or other mediums\u00a0 to read through what their plans areWe have our handout. Everything is on that as well. We\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of interviews. We do live townhall meetings. I\u2019m not what you call the \u201caverage candidate.\u201dI\u2019m not going to be, nor will I receive a paycheck. I\u2019m not \u2018gon take $50,000, $100,000 or $200,000 because then I\u2019m working for somebody in between the people. So I\u2019m not \u2018gon take that. I don\u2019t have to do that. The other politicians take dollars from people that they \u2018gon have to answer for.You don\u2019t have to answer to your donors? They won\u2019t hold you accountable to any promises?I don\u2019t do that. I answer straight to the people. But there are some people [who] don\u2019t need to be in the race, because they ain\u2019t got no money. I\u2019m just telling you point blank. It costs a lot of money out here. They need to be at home trying to take care of their families and wait til their time. Now they can borrow it \u2014 I\u2019m not knocking that either. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m in a position where I don\u2019t have to do it.I don\u2019t want to go back in slavery like I came out of slavery down South. I don\u2019t want nobody money. Pay my own way. My own commercials, we do our own thing. And I like that. That way, I can talk and say what I want to say on the camera. If somebody say something to me on camera I don\u2019t like, I can just tell them I don\u2019t like your remark. But if somebody else done paid me, then I got to answer to a Democratic Party or a Republican Party or any other party. Nah, I don\u2019t have to do that."

  "title": "Who\u2019s in the wrong? A deeper look into Willie Wilson, Ja\u2019Mal Green and the alleged bribe",
  "text": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since an audio recording leaked that featured a phone conversation between businessman Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant, Rickey Hendon, and a volunteer for community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s campaign. During that conversation, Hendon allegedly bribed the volunteer, Kevin Hobby, to drop Green\u2019s petition challenge against Wilson in the 2023 Chicago mayoral election.This also comes just as objection filings kicked off last week, which is a standard process in which one candidate objects to the signatures of another candidate. Over the next few weeks, the Chicago Board of Elections commissioners will review all the signatures that have been opposed and decide if those signatures (or challenges) are valid.\u00a0On Dec. 5, Wilson and Green filed petition challenges against one another; a victory by either would narrow the 11-candidate field for the mayor\u2019s race. Wilson also filed a separate challenge against another mayoral candidate: 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer. Other candidates seek to knock off long-shot candidates Frederick Collins and Johnny Logalbo.Chicago-based What\u2019s the Word TV was the first media outlet to publish the full recording of the leaked audio on its Instagram page on Dec. 8. The outlet has since removed the video. However, Chicago-based blog Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s also posted the video on its Instagram page.\u00a0On Dec. 8, in response to an inquiry from The TRiiBE, Wilson\u2019s campaign spokesperson, Richard Boykin, confirmed that it was Hendon\u2019s voice on the recording.\u00a0There were various opinions in the Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s comment section ranging from: \u201cPolitics as usual in the Chi,\u201d to \u201cno betta game anywhere than Chicago politics! Hollywood needs to stop,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s politics. What else is new\u201d or\u00a0 \u201cThis is why we have to support @jaymalgreen our future depends on it, these old-school politicians are outrageous.\u201d\u00a0Veteran political and media consultant Delmarie Cobb told The TRiiBE that the leaked audio recording is a bad look for both campaigns.\u00a0Although she added that what Hendon is accused of is unethical, the situation, she said, shows that Wilson\u2019s campaign will \u201cstoop to any level to win\u201d and \u201cthat it makes his [Wilson\u2019s] campaign look desperate,\u201d but added that it demonstrates that Green \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of who people think did the most wrong,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cSo, what side is public perception going to fall down on? Is it going to fall on the side of \u2018You can\u2019t be trusted? Or you\u2019ll do anything to win.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\n        Willie Wilson\u2019s political consultant Rickey Hendon allegedly called Ja\u2019Mal Green\u2019s team to bribe them to drop the challenge.Commenters on Chicago Media Takeout\u2019s post mirror Cobb\u2019s view of the situation. Some suggested that by recording the conversation, Green hurt his chances of winning the race. At the same time, some indicated that Green should not have recorded the conversation or that he should have accepted the bribe and bowed out of the race altogether. Others said that it was discouraging to see two mayoral campaigns acting in such a way.\u00a0Most comments also showed that most Chicagoans are used to seeing elected officials and candidates behaving like Hendon or Green. To many commenters, what transpired between Hendon\u2019s and Green\u2019s campaigns is just the Chicago way when it comes to politics.\u00a0Think back to Rod Blagojevich, the disgraced former Illinois governor who was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0Or consider current Chicago City Councilmembers Carrie Austin (34th Ward) and Ed Burke (14th Ward) as well as former 20th Ward Ald. Willie Cochran.In 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Burke faces racketeering, bribery and extortion charges based on allegations that he used his political power to force those doing business with the city to hire his private law firm, WTTW noted. Burke\u2019s trial is scheduled to begin in November 2023. In addition, both Austin and Burke announced that they would not be running in the 2023 municipal election after serving a combined total of 81 years.\u00a0In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in prison in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0Chicago continues to be the most corrupt city in Illinois, according to a 2020 University of Illinois at Chicago study. Since 1973, 30 alderpersons have been convicted of corruption, according to Block Club Chicago.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.However, what makes this case stand out among the decades-long history of elected leaders making deals behind closed doors is that the public heard the alleged bribe on audio and it was widely shared on social media platforms, said Cobb.\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of people trading jobs, money [and] contracts. People trade all of those things,\u201d Cobb explained.\u00a0It\u2019s a political strategy. Opponents in the race want to eliminate as many people as possible to avoid a runoff. She explained that the more candidates there are, the harder it becomes to avoid a runoff. The last two mayoral races, in 2015 and 2019, resulted in runoff elections.\u00a0So Cobb said it\u2019s common for some candidates to tell their opponents, \u201cI don\u2019t want you splitting the vote when you don\u2019t have a chance of winning. You don\u2019t have a chance of being the nominee. So we need you to get out. What would it take to get you out?\u2018\u201dAlthough it is a common practice, Cobb said that what is illegal in this case is whether or not Green\u2019s campaign worker recorded the conversation without Hendon\u2019s consent.\u00a0In a Dec. 8 press release, Green\u2019s team identified the volunteer on the call as Hobby.\u00a0\u201cAfter talking with our counsel, the video did not break the law as it was a public setting & Rickey was engaging in criminal activity. We want the proper authorities to investigate this matter further,\u201d according to a statement from Green.\u00a0In Illinois, it is a felony to intercept, record or transcribe any private telephone call or electronic communication unless all parties consent.\u00a0According to Ed Mullen, a Chicago-based election attorney, the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office (CCSAO) would be the agency tasked with investigating the matter further.\u00a0\u201cThe Chicago Board of Elections doesn\u2019t have a lot of authority,\u201d Mullen explained. \u201cSo they\u2019re not going to do any type of investigation into election interference. It would be either the Cook County state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office or the U.S. attorney.\u201dAt publishing time, it\u2019s unclear if Green\u2019s team filed a complaint with the CCSAO. The CCSAO could not be reached for comment.\u00a0Cobb said that some candidates decide to run for office for their own benefit.\u00a0\u201cThis is a long tradition of people offering jobs, money and contracts to get out of the race. But, on the other hand, some candidates get in the race hoping to be offered those things,\u201d she said.\u00a0Cobb said voters should examine how candidates are moving to vet their legitimacy come election time. That means researching whether they have a campaign headquarters and an updated campaign website that includes policy and their platform. In addition, their websites should not have misspelled words or grammatical errors. Without those things, it\u2019s clear to see who\u2019s a serious candidate, she said.\u00a0"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "El Concejal Roderick Sawyer (sexto distrito) no es ajeno a la pol\u00edtica de Chicago. Se ha desempe\u00f1ado en el Concejo Municipal desde 2011, cuando derrot\u00f3 a Freddrenna Lyle, quien fue nombrada concejal por el entonces alcalde Richard M. Daley en 1998.\u00a0Sawyer naci\u00f3 y se cri\u00f3, y a\u00fan reside, en Park Manor, uno de los vecindarios que representa en el Concejo Municipal, al igual que su padre. Al igual que Daley, Sawyer es hijo de un exalcalde de Chicago.\u00a0Tras la muerte de Harold Washington, Concejal Eugene Sawyer el padre de Sawyer, fue elegido por un grupo de concejales blancos para ser alcalde en vez de el aliado de Washington, Timothy Evans. Eugene Sawyer sirvi\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os hasta que fue derrotado por Daley en las elecciones para alcalde del 1989. Daley mantuvo el poder durante casi tres d\u00e9cadas, m\u00e1s que cualquier otro alcalde de Chicago. Sawyer explic\u00f3 que sigue los pasos de su padre no por legado familiar, sino como servidor p\u00fablico.\u00a0\u201cNo me postulo para alcalde por \u00e9l. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo\u201d, dijo.\u00a0Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a alcalde del 2023, Sawyer invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 5 de enero al restaurante Oooh Wee It Is, el cual es un negocio dirigido por personas Negras en Chatham conocido por su comida reconfortante sure\u00f1a.\u00a0Actualmente, Sawyer se desempe\u00f1a como presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Salud y Relaciones Humanas del Concejo Municipal. Adem\u00e1s, fue presidente del Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus y copresidente del Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0Dijo que su historial en el Concejo Municipal y el hecho de que se haya ganado el apoyo y la confianza de sus colegas en la c\u00e1mara prueban que est\u00e1 preparado para ser el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago.\u00a0\u201cHe presentado y se ha aprob\u00f3 legislaci\u00f3nes innovadoras en el Concejo Municipal, por lo que tengo una capacidad comprobada para hacer las cosas\u201d, dijo Sawyer.\u00a0Durante su mandato en el Concejo Municipal, ha defendido temas como la ordenanza Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) que estableci\u00f3 una junta civil electa de residentes de Chicago para supervisar el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Chicago (CPD), la lucha por un salario m\u00ednimo de $15, el impulso para una junta escolar representativa electa y la ordenanza de GoodKids Madcity\u2019s Peace Book.Tambi\u00e9n vot\u00f3 a favor de medidas impopulares, incluyendo el presupuesto del 2011 de Emanuel, que se aprob\u00f3 por unanimidad y cerr\u00f3 seis de las 12 instalaciones de salud mental de la ciudad, y una medida del 2017 para adquirir una propiedad en West Garfield Park para una academia de polic\u00eda, que se aprob\u00f3 48 a 1.Durante nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, Sawyer habl\u00f3 sobre sus planes para abordar la violencia, la salud mental, la juventud, la vivienda asequible, las reparaciones para los habitantes Negros de Chicago y m\u00e1s.\u00a0No est\u00e1 llamando a aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto del CPD. En cambio, de acuerdo con su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, quiere reclutar m\u00e1s polic\u00edas, reparar el sistema de respuesta de emergencia de la ciudad, mejorar el bienestar de los oficiales, invertir en capacitaci\u00f3n policial integral y m\u00e1s. Adem\u00e1s, apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma, quiere abordar las causas profundas de la violencia y llama a revitalizar los vecindarios que han sufrido desinversi\u00f3n durante d\u00e9cadas.Como concejal, su vot\u00f3 estaba alineado con el del alcalde Rahm Emanuel el 100 por ciento del tiempo desde abril del 2017 hasta noviembre del 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Sawyer como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE:\u00a0 \u00bfC\u00f3mo impact\u00f3 y molde\u00f3 el crecer en Park Manor su pol\u00edtica?Concejal Roderick Sawyer: Crecer en Park Manor y todav\u00eda seguir viviendo aqu\u00ed habla muy bien del vecindario y la gente de aqu\u00ed. Cuando era ni\u00f1o, lo vi en su mejor momento. He visto a la comunidad de Park Manor luchar, y pasar por tiempos dif\u00edciles. Nunca cambi\u00f3 mi decision de querer quedarme aqu\u00ed y tratar de mejorar lo que hay aqu\u00ed.Soy muy firme sobre de d\u00f3nde vengo. Paso una cantidad excesiva de tiempo en mi vecindario porque siento mucho por la gente de aqu\u00ed. Ellos me formaron en lo que ahora soy. Entonces, como abogado, como persona de negocios y como residente, es abrumador el amor que recibo de mis vecinos de Park Manor, mis vecinos de Chatham, porque todos hemos superado esa lucha. Todos \u00e9ramos ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os juntos, traviesos, jug\u00e1bamos en los callejones y and\u00e1bamos en bicicleta por la zona. As\u00ed que para m\u00ed quedarme aqu\u00ed y elegir estar aqu\u00ed no es un testamento para m\u00ed, pero es un testamento para los que me rodean. Eso es extremadamente importante.Eres hijo del segundo alcalde Negro de Chicago, Eugene Sawyer.S\u00ed.Cuando el Concejo Municipal estaba seleccionando un sucesor despu\u00e9s del fallecimiento de Harold Washington, exist\u00eda la preocupaci\u00f3n de que nombrar a su padre para el puesto significar\u00eda un regreso a las pol\u00edticas anteriores. Adem\u00e1s, la mayor parte del apoyo que recibi\u00f3 de la c\u00e1mara provino de concejales blancos que obstru\u00edan al entonces alcalde Harold Washington y su agenda. Tambi\u00e9n hubo algunas acusaciones de algunos en la comunidad que acusaron a su padre de venderse a pol\u00edticos blancos.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ingreso a la contienda? \u00bfEs para seguir los pasos de su padre? \u00bfQu\u00e9 aprendio de su padre sobre el servicio p\u00fablico?Bueno, hagamos algunas correcciones. Primero, mi padre fue elegido porque era el mejor candidato para ese puesto. Fue un momento problem\u00e1tico despu\u00e9s de la muerte de nuestro amigo Harold Washington.Mi padre fue presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Reglas y presidente pro tempore. Eso significaba que \u00e9l dirig\u00eda el Comit\u00e9 de Reglas, y cuando Harold sali\u00f3, asumi\u00f3 el mando. Esa fue una enorme cantidad de responsabilidad dada a mi padre. Nadie ha ocupado nunca dos presidencias de comit\u00e9 al mismo tiempo adem\u00e1s de \u00e9l. As\u00ed que lo doy como testamento de confianza del alcalde a mi padre. El alcalde sab\u00eda que el trabajo se iba a hacer. Adem\u00e1s, cuando muri\u00f3 Harold, mi padre aprob\u00f3 todas las iniciativas que Harold trat\u00f3 de aprobar y no pudo debido a su prematura muerte. Incluso cosas que iban en contra de sus propios intereses personales.Mi padre era devoto de Harold Washington. As\u00ed que toda esa charla era una tonter\u00eda acerca de que \u00e9l estaba en deuda con los intereses de los blancos. Mi padre era un orgulloso hombre Negro de este vecindario [Park Manor] y Greensboro, Alabama. Una persona que estuvo all\u00ed protegiendo la casa de Martin Luther King mientras estaba en el estado de Alabama.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que todo ese ruido que hac\u00eda la gente en ese entonces era muy preocupante. Fue desalentador porque los intereses de mi padre eran sus residentes, la ciudad, Chicago y el Distrito 6.\u00a0Sin embargo, para responder a su \u00faltima pregunta, mi padre me ense\u00f1\u00f3 mucho sobre lo importante que es ser un buen administrador de su comunidad y lo importante que es el servicio p\u00fablico. Entonces en ese sentido, si, estoy siguiendo los pasos de mi padre, no como alcalde sino como servidor p\u00fablico aqu\u00ed en un \u00e1rea donde nac\u00ed y crec\u00ed, y por eso y lo que vi de \u00e9l, c\u00f3mo la gente lo ten\u00eda en alto estima porque ayudaba a los que estaban en este barrio. As\u00ed que quer\u00eda continuar ese mismo tipo de servicio. No me postulo para alcalde por mi padre. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo.Le\u00ed que cree que el crimen es el problema m\u00e1s importante de nuestra ciudad. Sin embargo, si es elegido, dijo que primero despedir\u00eda al superintendente de polic\u00eda de CPD. David Marr\u00f3n. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 o por qu\u00e9 no?Creo que nuestro mayor problema es la ansiedad por el crimen. Eso significa que no importa d\u00f3nde vivas en la ciudad. Si sales, sientes que existe la posibilidad de que te pase algo. Esa es la ansiedad, y eso tiene un costo econ\u00f3mico.\u00a0Los que tienen medios y recursos no salen porque sienten esa ansiedad. Eso significa que no gastan dinero en restaurantes, bares, teatros, gimnasios, cervecer\u00edas, clubs de salud y todas las cosas en las que esperar\u00edamos que gastaran dinero [en].Cuando vi a David Brown en Dallas , me anim\u00f3. Pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda un buen superintendente porque apoyaba a sus polic\u00edas en Dallas. Vi que era duro con el crimen y un tipo con fuerza. Desafortunadamente, no estamos recibiendo a ese mismo tipo aqu\u00ed ahora. Este no es el mismo David Brown.Si fuera elegido, aprovechar\u00eda esa oportunidad para usar la plataforma en la que trabaj\u00e9 durante siete a\u00f1os, Empowering Communities for Public Safety, o ECPS [ordenanza].Me enorgullece decir que fui el patrocinador principal de la ordenanza ECPS y ayud\u00e9 a llevarla a cabo. Entonces, elegiremos miembros de la comunidad para restablecer la confianza entre la comunidad y la polic\u00eda y, cuando lo hagamos, la gente se sentir\u00e1 m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda hablando con la polic\u00eda. Eso significa que le dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a la polic\u00eda, lo que significa que podemos resolver m\u00e1s cr\u00edmenes, as\u00ed es como funciona. Es un efecto domin\u00f3.Soy un gran defensor de eso. Tambi\u00e9n usar\u00e9 esa misma plataforma para elegir un superintendente que tenga el respeto del departamento de polic\u00eda, de las bases, que haya pasado por el sistema, que comprenda lo que necesitamos para que los oficiales se concentren en su trabajo, lo cual es detener a la gente mala y atarlos para que tengan un juicio.\u00bfUsted piensa en aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto de CPD? \u00bfC\u00f3mo piensa que deber\u00eda asignarse el presupuesto policial?Debemos tener los recursos necesarios para responder a las llamadas de servicio. La Ciudad de Chicago est\u00e1 en un negocio de servicios. Eso es especialmente cierto para la polic\u00eda. La polic\u00eda es un servicio. Son servidores p\u00fablicos; te sirven y sirven a todos aqu\u00ed.Entonces, si no tenemos suficientes oficiales para responder a las llamadas y toma m\u00e1s de una hora responder a las llamadas, eso es un problema. Eso est\u00e1 aumentando esa misma ansiedad de la que habl\u00e9. As\u00ed que ahora me han robado, llamo a la polic\u00eda y no aparece nadie. Eso se siente como si nadie me estuviera protegiendo. Esa es esa ansiedad continua. As\u00ed que no me har\u00e1 sentir mejor si nadie aparece.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, esto es lo que estamos hablando de hacer para las llamadas no violentas, digamos, desafortunadamente, te robaron, pero est\u00e1s bien. No te hicieron da\u00f1o. Se llevaron tu billetera, bolso o auto. Puede llamar al 9-1-1, y podemos enviar a alguien para obtener un informe de usted, un oficial uniformado. Puede ser un oficial retirado que sabe c\u00f3mo tomar el informe y obtener descripciones de usted y transmitir esa informaci\u00f3n a aquellos en la calle que, con suerte, pueden detener a ese sospechoso o delincuente y llevarlos a juicio.\u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 en seguridad? Seg\u00fan lo que dijo, \u00bfeso significa que contratar\u00eda m\u00e1s polic\u00edas?Contratar\u00eda polic\u00edas cuando sea apropiado. Me asegurar\u00eda de que superemos el nivel de jubilaciones y deserciones. La gente se est\u00e1 yendo. Y aseg\u00farese de que no sea un enfoque de uno u otro. Creo en dotar a los oficiales del nivel adecuado. Tal vez sean oficiales jubilados o civiles que necesitamos contratar para conseguir a esos oficiales que necesitamos para salir a la calle.\u00a0Es posible que solo necesitemos reasignar algunas posiciones. Pero eso no significa que no debamos invertir en servicios de salud mental, oportunidades laborales, capacitaci\u00f3n laboral, abuso de drogas y sustancias, o adicci\u00f3n. No, es un enfoque de ambos y. Tenemos que invertir en todas esas cosas.\u00bfHay otras formas fuera de la polic\u00eda en las que invertir\u00eda en seguridad?Nuevamente, invertir en la respuesta del tratamiento de los servicios de salud mental para que, tal vez, alguien pueda reducir la intensidad de una situaci\u00f3n en lugar de arrestar a alguien. Podemos proporcionar servicios de adicci\u00f3n a las drogas a aquellos que son dependientes a ellas. Tenemos que invertir en ambas cosas. No es de hacer esto y no hacer aquello. Se deben hacer ambas cosas.En el 2020, propuso eliminar CPD de CPS en el Concejo Municipal. \u00bfHa cambiado su opini\u00f3n acerca de eso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?Bueno, d\u00e9jame decir esto. Mi objetivo no era sacar a los polic\u00edas de las escuelas. Quer\u00eda iniciar una conversaci\u00f3n sobre lo que hacen los oficiales de polic\u00eda en ciertas escuelas y c\u00f3mo a veces tiene un efecto negativo en sus estudiantes. Me alegro de que haya funcionado como lo hizo porque las escuelas ahora toman una decisi\u00f3n. Pueden elegir si quieren oficiales en su escuela o no quieren oficiales, y es una elecci\u00f3n del LSC [Consejo Escolar Local] de la escuela. Estoy muy contento con la forma en que sali\u00f3.\u00a0La gente simplemente malinterpret\u00f3 mi objetivo. Mi objetivo era provocar una discusi\u00f3n, lo cual sucedi\u00f3. A veces tienes que hacer cosas audaces, y es por eso que necesitas un l\u00edder que no tenga miedo de tomar una decisi\u00f3n audaz. No tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n precipitada; Tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n audaz.\u00a0Terminamos ahorrando algo de dinero. Ahorramos varios millones de d\u00f3lares para aquellas escuelas que eligieron no tener oficiales en su escuela y aquellas que mantuvieron oficiales en escuelas que estaban contentas con sus oficiales. Empoder\u00f3 a los representantes del LSC y a otros a tomar decisiones sobre el futuro de sus escuelas, lo cual me alegro mucho de poder haber hecho.Muchos de sus colegas votaron a favor de la propuesta del alcalde Lightfoot de extender y ampliar el toque de queda para los j\u00f3venes en toda la ciudad a pesar de que cr\u00edticos decian que afectar\u00eda desproporcionadamente a los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latine. Fue uno de los concejales negros que vot\u00f3 en contra. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS? \u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda estos planes?Est\u00e1bamos pensando en c\u00f3mo mantenerlos alejados, en lugar de relacionarnos con ellos y tenerlos en un espacio seguro donde puedan divertirse, y cuando llegue el momento de irse a casa, se ir\u00e1n a casa. Est\u00e1n cansados \u200b\u200by se la pasaron bien. Les proporcionamos algo bueno y los organizadores ganaron un poco de dinero. As\u00ed es como gan\u00e9 dinero cuando era ni\u00f1o. Hice fiestas. Yo era DJ, organizaba fiestas y estaba involucrado en eso.\u00a0As\u00ed que no veo eso en la juventud en este momento. Por eso est\u00e1n tan frustrados que no tienen d\u00f3nde desahogarse. Cuando eres joven, tienes mucha energ\u00eda reprimida que necesitas liberar, as\u00ed que eso es bailar y actuar chistoso por un momento. Necesit\u00e1bamos proporcionarles eso. Entonces se frustran y se van a comportar mal, y eso es lo que sucedi\u00f3 y eso es un fracaso de nuestra parte.Como concejal, usted vot\u00f3 para cerrar la mitad de las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental de la ciudad durante la administraci\u00f3n del entonces alcalde Rahm Emanuel. Sin embargo, en el sitio de web de su campa\u00f1a, dijo que apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma. Si apoya Tratamiento No Trauma, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 vot\u00f3 para cerrar esas cl\u00ednicas de salud mental?Cuando me eligieron, entr\u00e9 como presidente del comit\u00e9 de salud y relaciones humanas, y lo primero que hice fue visitar los centros de salud mental restantes. Estaban vac\u00edos.\u00a0\u00a0Apenas hab\u00eda pacientes de ning\u00fan nivel. Los visit\u00e9 a todos. Dijeron que nunca los visit\u00f3 ning\u00fan consejal. Los he visitado todos. Lo primero que hice fue mirarlos todos y ver cu\u00e1les eran los recursos y si estaban ocupados. Me pregunte, \u00bfNecesit\u00e1bamos proporcionar m\u00e1s recursos?Cuando hice esa votaci\u00f3n sobre los centros de salud mental, un par de a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s escrib\u00ed un art\u00edculo, y dije que si pod\u00eda retirar un voto, el \u00fanico voto que retirar\u00eda era el cierre del servicio de salud mental [las cl\u00ednicas]. Deber\u00edamos haber tomado m\u00e1s tiempo antes de hacer esa decisi\u00f3n.No creo que no deber\u00edan de ver sido cerradas. Lo que deber\u00edamos haber hecho es enfocarnos un poco m\u00e1s y averiguar por qu\u00e9 la administraci\u00f3n quer\u00eda que se cerraran las clinicas. Nosotros no hicimos eso; era una medida de ahorro de dinero para reducir costos. Mis ojos se abrieron cuando visit\u00e9 las clinicas y me di cuenta de que no las est\u00e1bamos usando. No las anunciamos ni las promocionamos. No se sab\u00eda que exist\u00edan y que la gente pod\u00eda ir all\u00ed gratis.\u00a0Me di cuenta de que no aceptaban ni\u00f1es. Gracias a nuestra defensa, ahora est\u00e1n dando cuidado a ni\u00f1es. Est\u00e1n ampliando sus horarios y est\u00e1n empezando a promocionar las clinicas. As\u00ed que tuve un papel para garantizar que la administraci\u00f3n se diera cuenta de un problema relacionado con nuestro servicio de salud mental.Como sabe, los votantes de su distrito apoyaron abrumadoramente el refer\u00e9ndum Tratamiento, No Trauma durante en las votaciones al mitad del mandato del 2022. Si es elegido, \u00bfc\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda los planes espec\u00edficos bajo la ordenanza Tratamiento No Trauma?Tenemos fondos disponibles para Tratamiento No Trauma. El Departamento de Salud tiene un presupuesto s\u00f3lido. Podemos financiar Tratamiento No Trauma, sin problemas. Debido a que ese dinero est\u00e1 destinado a ciertas cosas, podemos tener ese dinero disponible para cosas como servicios de salud mental. Podemos usar el dinero que est\u00e1 disponible ahora.\u00a0No es tanto un problema de financiaci\u00f3n. Es un problema de intencionalidad. \u00bfLa gente quiere que esto suceda? No veo por qu\u00e9 no lo quicieran. Puede salvar la vida de alguien brind\u00e1ndole servicios de salud mental en lugar de traer a un oficial de polic\u00eda.\u00a0Un oficial de polic\u00eda est\u00e1 entrenado para hacer una determinada cosa. Los oficiales de polic\u00eda est\u00e1n capacitados para detener y arrestar. Ese es su trabajo. Es necesario en ciertos casos: cuando alguien te est\u00e1 robando, quieres a la polic\u00eda. Cuando alguien tiene un problema de salud mental, no quieres a la polic\u00eda. Quieres un experto en salud mental. Quiere a alguien que pueda decirle \"c\u00e1lmese\" o dirigirlo a los servicios adecuados. Necesita ese tipo de voz que te tranquiliza y que pueda ayudarte.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?Estamos a punto de tener una junta escolar representativa electa que ser\u00e1 aut\u00f3noma y trabajar\u00e1 de manera independiente. Mientras tanto, me asegurar\u00e9 de que las escuelas tengan todos los recursos necesarios para que tengan \u00e9xito. Soy un gran defensor de las escuelas del vecindario.\u00a0\u00a0Quiero asegurarme de que obtengamos todos los recursos posibles para la mayor\u00eda de los estudiantes porque eso es lo importante. El futuro de nuestra ciudad son nuestros ni\u00f1es. Quiero asegurarme de que todo lo que hagamos, en lo que se refiere a las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago, est\u00e9 en la l\u00ednea correcta, sin cometer ninguna locura. He trabajado con CTU [Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago] en el pasado y continuar\u00e9 trabajando con CTU en el futuro. Simplemente no estoy en deuda con CTU. No voy a dejarme dictar por nadie.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00e1 los planes para invertir en las escuelas del vecindario?He estado involucrado por mucho tiempo y tambi\u00e9n he sido presidente de LSC durante 12 a\u00f1os. Siempre he sido de la opini\u00f3n de que tenemos que manejar bien las finanzas de las escuelas. El dinero gastado en ciertas cosas rid\u00edculas a veces tiene que ser mirado y eliminado. Por lo tanto, desea asegurarme de que las escuelas puedan operar de manera independiente, dentro de los l\u00edmites de su presupuesto basado en la f\u00f3rmula del estudiante. Eso necesita ser cambiado, pero eso es parte de invertir en las escuelas. Creo que eso es parte de una discusi\u00f3n m\u00e1s larga que se tiene que hacer con el estado. Voy a sumergirme en ese tipo de cosas. Porque cuando hablo de restablecer Chicago, estos son los tipos de cosas que debemos restablecer.\u00bfA qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00e1 para la junta h\u00edbrida?Me gustar\u00eda una mezcla de educadores, personas de la comunidad y personas interesadas en el futuro de nuestros hijes. No creo que tenga una medida establecida probada y verdadera de a qui\u00e9n quiero nombrar en cuanto a personas. A\u00fan as\u00ed, deseo que las personas en la industria financiera entiendan c\u00f3mo operar los presupuestos y se adhieran a ellos. Quiere educadores, para que tengamos un plan adecuado para todes los estudiantes, no solo para los de alto rendimiento.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiero personas que puedan involucrar a los padres y otros miembros del comit\u00e9 para que se involucren en lo que sucede en las escuelas. Las escuelas deben estar abiertas todo el d\u00eda y la noche, con recursos y programas para los estudiantes y, si es necesario, para los padres. A veces los padres necesitan alguna formaci\u00f3n o educaci\u00f3n adicional. As\u00ed que quiero que todo eso suceda, y que la escuela sea el centro de ese vecindario con todos esos recursos en un solo lugar.Usted mencion\u00f3 que ha trabajado con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago. \u00bfHay alg\u00fan plan o propuesta espec\u00edfica que tenga para financiar las escuelas? Estuve mirando su sitio de web y no estaba muy claro c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan esas pol\u00edticas.Los fondos provienen de una variedad de fuentes: algunos provienen de los impuestos a la propiedad, algunos de nuestro gobierno estatal y federal, algunos de la ciudad de Chicago. Queremos asegurarnos de analizar todas esas fuentes de financiaci\u00f3n y ver c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n funcionando.Seguimos aumentando la financiaci\u00f3n escolar, aunque el n\u00famero de matr\u00edculas sigue bajando, algo no tiene sentido. Una vez que pueda llegar all\u00ed, echarle un vistazo a las fuentes de fondos y sumergirme en \u00e9l, veremos cu\u00e1l es el problema. \u00bfEs muy pesado al principio? \u00bfTiene CPS demasiadas propiedades inmobiliarias que no est\u00e1n funcionando? \u00bfSon cuestiones presupuestarias? \u00bfTenemos demasiados directores adjuntos y comisionados adjuntos en la oficina principal y necesitamos m\u00e1s personas en primera l\u00ednea ense\u00f1ando a nuestros hijes?S\u00e9 que muchas escuelas han eliminado los AP [subdirectores]. Pero, por ejemplo, eso no deber\u00eda pasar. Quitamos ayudantes en k\u00ednder y primer grado, donde ahora tienes una maestra sola con 35 ni\u00f1es de cinco a\u00f1os. No es un m\u00e9todo de apoyo, y no mejorar\u00e1 la educaci\u00f3n.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda investigar estas cosas y asegurarme de que estamos haciendo lo correcto para nuestros estudiantes, no necesariamente para el sindicato [CTU] o el personal de la oficina principal. Tenemos que concentrarnos en lo que es importante, y son esos ni\u00f1es.Nuestros lectores estan curiosos acerca de los impuestos. Entonces, \u00bflo que est\u00e1 proponiendo hacer requerir\u00eda aumentar los impuestos de la propiedad?No, ese ser\u00eda el \u00faltimo recurso. Dir\u00e9 que muchos candidatos usan esto como un punto de venta para decir \"no impuestos\" o \"nunca impuestos\". Deben de tener una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable. Una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable, por ejemplo, en lo que se refiere a los impuestos de bienes y ra\u00edces, son pasos peque\u00f1os e incrementales para mejorar los impuestos.\u00a0Si nuestro IPC [\u00edndice de precios al consumidor] sube, deber\u00edamos tener un peque\u00f1o aumento en los impuestos a la propiedad para reflejar el aumento en el costo de los bienes y servicios. Entonces, si eso sucede, debemos hacer ese cambio incremental en lugar de lo que hemos estado haciendo ahora, diciendo que todo est\u00e1 bien. \u201cNo, no necesitamos aumentar los impuestos nunca, nunca, nunca hasta despu\u00e9s de una elecci\u00f3n de, 'oh, tenemos que aumentar los impuestos'. Eso es irresponsable, y est\u00e1 mal. Deber\u00edamos buscar pol\u00edticas fiscales m\u00e1s responsables, algo que la gente ni siquiera notar\u00e1 un aumento del uno al dos por ciento en sus impuestos de vez en cuando.Si el IPC baja, entonces podemos buscar descuentos y tal vez reembolsos para aquellos que pagan impuestos. Pero nuevamente, solo si el panorama financiero parece estar justificado, no solo porque a la gente le gusta escucharlo y no lo hacemos. Eso es lo que nos meti\u00f3 en el problema en primer lugar de no pagar nuestras obligaciones de pensi\u00f3n y no aumentar los impuestos para hacer cosas necesarias, en lugar de hacer cosas populares.Chicago es una ciudad llena de barrios vibrantes. Pero se est\u00e1 volviendo dif\u00edcil para muchas personas permanecer en la ciudad. Hay nuevos desarrollos que se avecinan en el centro de los barrios. Me refiero espec\u00edficamente al proyecto de Bally\u2019s casino. Usted vot\u00f3 a favor de eso. Entonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para ayudar a los propietarios e inquilinos del desplazamiento o a las personas sin hogar?Vot\u00e9 a favor de eso. Uno, tenemos un presupuesto muy s\u00f3lido en este momento para personas sin hogar. El problema es que solo gastamos alrededor del 5 por ciento del dinero. Tenemos mucho dinero esperando para gastarlo en iniciativas para personas sin hogar. A veces estamos mirando en la direcci\u00f3n equivocada. No quiero gastar dinero que beneficiar\u00e1 a los desarrolladores m\u00e1s de lo que beneficia a las personas sin hogar. Ah\u00ed es donde realmente tengo un problema, y \u200b\u200blo mantengo.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, cuando la gente habla de cosas como Bring Chicago Home, me encanta la intenci\u00f3n. Pero cuando empiezas analizar con mas cuidado, te das cuenta que los desarrolladores tender\u00edan a beneficiarse m\u00e1s que las personas sin hogar. Podemos ayudar a las personas sin hogar ahora mismo. Casi podemos erradicar la falta de vivienda excepto por un par de problemas.\u00a0Tenemos dinero para albergar a las personas que contamos. La mayor\u00eda de ellos no quieren entrar en los tipos de estructuras que estamos acostumbrados a construir. Prefieren estar en esa comunidad en la que est\u00e1n a la salida de Roosevelt Road en la autopista porque al menos saben que se van a cuidar unos a otros. Ah\u00ed es donde est\u00e1 su comunidad.\u00a0Puede que no lo entendamos. He hablado con suficientes personas sin hogar para saber que a veces la ayuda que buscan no es la ayuda que estamos acostumbrados a proporcionar. Si estamos diciendo, puedo cuidarte y ponerte en un refugio. No quieren estar en un refugio. Saben que les han robado, violado y asaltado en los albergues, tienen una mala experiencia en los albergues, no quieren volver.\u00a0Hablemos de brindarles recursos, tratamiento, oportunidad, empleo y capacitaci\u00f3n, para llevarlos a un espacio donde podamos conseguirles una casa o un apartamento de inicio, y luego puedan continuar recibiendo el tratamiento o la experiencia laboral para ganar dinero. Eso es lo que miro. Busco soluciones m\u00e1s org\u00e1nicas, no solo decir, oye, vamos a dejarlas en un albergue y hemos cumplido con nuestra parte. Eso no es suficiente.Recuerdo estar en una reuni\u00f3n en la que estaba con otros funcionarios electos Negros. En la reuni\u00f3n, explic\u00f3 lo desafiante que es para usted y sus colegas representar partes de Englewood porque tiene muchas propiedades vacantes y abandonadas. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus planes para revitalizar vecindarios, como Englewood, con muchas \u00e1reas/propiedades vacantes?Lo que no hacemos es dar a nuestros desarrolladores Negros y todos los desarrolladores que son minor\u00edas recursos y oportunidades para desarrollar en sus vecindarios. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, lo que sea. Tenemos \u00e1reas abandonadas por toda la ciudad y podr\u00edamos beneficiarnos de la llegada de desarrolladores. Ning\u00fan desarrollador del centro va a venir aqu\u00ed y te dir\u00e1 lo mismo. Un desarrollador me dijo que si construyo en Fulton Market, puedo obtener cierta cantidad por unidad que alquile o venda. Y si construyo en los otros vecindarios, no puede obtener tanto. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es mi incentivo para venir aqu\u00ed a construir?\u00a0Tenemos constructores afroamericanos que construir\u00e1n. Tendr\u00edamos que relajar algunos de los problemas sindicales y otros para darles una ventaja para hacer desarrollos de calidad aqu\u00ed en los lados sur y oeste.\u00a0Necesitamos comenzar a hacer eso y lograr que estos desarrolladores se involucren para que ya no puedan ser peque\u00f1os desarrolladores. Tendr\u00e1n una meta y una mentalidad para negociar m\u00e1s en un vecindario que los ayud\u00f3 a criarse en lugar de simplemente ir al centro.Pueden construir una cuadra a la vez. Tal vez dos o tres desarrolladores, luego construyan la cuadra completa y luego podemos hacer otra cuadra. Porque literalmente tengo cuadras de terreno bald\u00edo en esta peque\u00f1a \u00e1rea de Englewood que tengo. S\u00e9 que mis colegas tienen extensiones de tierra a\u00fan m\u00e1s grandes que podr\u00edan desarrollarse y venderse o alquilarse, o en cualquier caso, a propietarios que est\u00e1n trabajando, pero necesitan ayuda para llegar a fin de mes.\u00a0Podemos conseguirles esa vivienda asequible y de calidad aqu\u00ed. Cerca del tren. Si est\u00e1n trabajando en el centro de la ciudad, pueden subirse al tren y en 15 minutos llegar al trabajo o la escuela o donde tengan que estar. Necesitamos comenzar a ver eso en lugar de solo concentrarnos en el centro de la ciudad. Sin embargo, s\u00e9 lo importante que es el centro de la ciudad para nosotros. Pero no lo es todo.Los habitantes Negros de Chicago se han ido de la ciudad desde la d\u00e9cada del 2000 por muchas razones. Pero me pregunto, qu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas o planes espec\u00edficos promulgar\u00e1 su administraci\u00f3n para que no perdamos m\u00e1s habitantes Negros de Chicago.Debemos tener un plan de mercadotecnia para traer a la gente de regreso a Chicago. Literalmente deber\u00eda ser: traer a los habitantes de Chicago de vuelta a casa. Necesitamos comprometernos con la gente de mercadotecnia, preferiblemente con personas Negras. Chicago es una gran ciudad. Chicago tiene muchas comodidades. Es una ciudad de clase mundial. Podemos eliminar las cosas problem\u00e1ticas y hacerlas vibrantes. No hay otra ciudad mejor.\u00a0Necesitamos promover eso y hacer una inversi\u00f3n. A veces hay que invertir para recuperar algo. No me gusta gastar dinero por gastar dinero; los sorteos y trucos no son lo mio. As\u00ed que vamos a hacer verdaderas inversiones en Chicago, invertir en el futuro de Chicago, asegur\u00e1ndonos de que las personas sepan lo grandiosa que es Chicago y las comodidades que podemos brindarles.\u00a0Englewood se puede restaurar a gran gloria. Es intencional de quien est\u00e1 a la cabeza, encabezando eso, y tiene ese sentido de visi\u00f3n para decir que podemos hacer esto aqu\u00ed en Englewood, podemos hacer esto en East Garfield Park, podemos hacer esto en Lawndale. Podemos hacer esto y todas estas otras \u00e1reas desafiantes, como Pilsen y La Villita. Podemos hacerlo en \u00e1reas que han sido marginadas en el pasado. Se necesita que el l\u00edder en la cima diga, esto es lo que vamos a hacer, y as\u00ed es como lo haremos.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiamos eso?Hay una variedad de formas de financiarlo. Hay financiaci\u00f3n de bonos. Hay muchos mecanismos de financiaci\u00f3n diferentes, especialmente en las zonas deterioradas. Trabajaremos con nuestros socios en el gobierno estatal y federal. Puede que tengamos que emitir bonos. Tuvimos que emitir algo de deuda para hacer algunas de las cosas y ponerlas en marcha. Hay una variedad de formas. No estamos sin dinero. A veces luchamos porque tomamos malas decisiones, y necesitamos tomar menos malas decisiones y m\u00e1s decisiones conservadoras desde el punto de vista financiero que tengan sentido. Haces inversiones; no gastas dinero.Hablando de invertir en Black Chicago y mantener a los Negros aqu\u00ed, \u00bfdeber\u00edan las reparaciones estar al frente como prioridad en el 2023?Siento que si deber\u00eda ser asi. He estado tratando de impulsar las reparaciones durante a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de conocer m\u00e1s al respecto, lo present\u00e9 al Concejo Municipal. El alcalde me dijo: \u201cYo no voy a hacer nada sobre las reparaciones; eso no es m\u00e1s que un truco de Willie Wilson\u201d.El Sr. Wilson nos estaba ayudando financieramente con la difusi\u00f3n de las reparaciones. Tambi\u00e9n estaba aprendiendo sobre las reparaciones. Est\u00e1bamos haciendo lo que pod\u00edamos para mostrar lo importante es la reparaci\u00f3n. He hablado con epidemi\u00f3logos y epigenetistas.Los problemas que tenemos actualmente se remontan a que estabamos esclavizados y atravesamos la era de Jim Crow, y la discriminacion basado en los vecindarios, y todas las cosas por las que hemos pasado durante d\u00e9cadas y d\u00e9cadas, y eso nos hace reaccionar de cierta manera. Necesitamos sumergirnos en eso y descubrir cu\u00e1l es ese problema, y \u200b\u200buna vez que lo hagamos, todos se beneficiar\u00e1n. As\u00ed que no estoy tan interesado en otra cosa que no sean los 40 acres y el dinero. Eso es m\u00e1s una conversaci\u00f3n federal. Lo m\u00edo son m\u00e1s las brechas de salud, las brechas educativas y cosas as\u00ed que son importantes, y hay una raz\u00f3n para ello. Hay una raz\u00f3n para eso, y no creo que lo hayamos profundizado lo suficiente. Hay una palabra para eso. La alcalde [Lightfoot] no usar\u00eda la palabra reparaciones. Si le preguntas, no dir\u00eda reparaciones.\u00bfSu plan inicial era solo obtener una comisi\u00f3n de personas?Ya hemos estudiado bastante. No se trataba de un estudio. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n de reparaciones igual a Calles y Saneamiento y al Departamento de Transporte. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n a nivel ejecutivo sobre reparaciones para discutir la reparaci\u00f3n que necesitamos como descendientes de africanos esclavizados.\u00a0\u00a0No pude obtener apoyo. Ni siquiera pude obtener el apoyo de la gente Negra. Fue dif\u00edcil porque la gente no lo entend\u00eda. Recuerdo que algunos de mis colegas asistieron a un par de reuniones porque ten\u00eda que tener reuniones fuera del sitio y no pude obtener una reuni\u00f3n en el consejo.\u00a0Bajo mi administraci\u00f3n, las reparaciones estar\u00e1n a primera fila. Tenemos que hablar de eso. Tenemos que hacerlo. Tenemos que entender, y quiero que m\u00e1s gente entienda. Quiero que los blancos y todos lo entiendan porque es vital para todos.Me di cuenta de que no necesariamente tiene patrocinios a gran escala como sus otros oponentes en la carrera.No, porque no estoy en deuda con nadie en esta carrera.Entonces, \u00bfa qui\u00e9n le rindes cuentas?Soy responsable ante los ciudadanos de la ciudad de Chicago. Estas son las personas que tengo en alta estima y me siento responsable ante los residentes cotidianos, las personas que van a trabajar todos los d\u00edas, las personas desempleadas, las personas que luchan y las personas que les va bien. Represento a los verdaderos habitantes de Chicago, aquellos que quieren buenas escuelas, distritos comerciales vibrantes, calles seguras y disfrutar de sus vecindarios y volver a casa seguros. Estas son las personas que represento. Estas son las personas que me apoyan.Tuve que repasar algunos art\u00edculos y entrevistas anteriores para preparar mis preguntas de hoy porque su sitio web al momento de esta entrevista todavia no tiene una plataforma de pol\u00edticas escrita. \u00bfC\u00f3mo pueden los votantes de Chicago confiar en usted como legislador y responsabilizarlo por sus promesas de campa\u00f1a?He sido tan prodigioso en asuntos de pol\u00edtica como cualquier concejal del Concejo Municipal. Desde la lucha contra la privatizaci\u00f3n hasta la reforma policial y las iniciativas comerciales, he demostrado mis habilidades para hacer que las cosas avancen y cumplirlasa.\u00a0La junta escolar representativa electa, estuvimos all\u00ed; paz laboral en los aeropuertos y cuidado de ni\u00f1es. Estas son cosas en las que siempre tuve al frente, liderando, no solo votando por ello, liderando, abogando por obtener votos, azotando votos y aprob\u00e1ndolo.\u00a0Mi historia habla por s\u00ed misma, tengo los antecedentes y experiencia. He demostrado que puedo trabajar en diferentes comit\u00e9s. Trabajo con miembros de DSA [Socialistas Democr\u00e1ticos de Am\u00e9rica]. Trabajo con el caucus conservador. Trabajo con el caucus de veteranos, trabajo con todos. Me aseguro de que mis ordenanzas obtengan el apoyo de todos los niveles de representaci\u00f3n en el consejo. Eso es lo que obtendr\u00e1n del alcalde Sawyer."

  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green va a ser visto y escuchado. Green es una cara familiar en las protestas que buscaban justicia para Laquan McDonald y otras v\u00edctimas de la violencia policial. En el 2017 a solo 21 a\u00f1os, Green lleg\u00f3 a los titulares nacionales cuando le dijo a una audiencia de MSNBC Townhall que el ex alcalde Rahm Emanuel no se preocupa por la gente Negra.Hoy, contin\u00faa confrontando a los pol\u00edticos de frente; durante foros de candidatos recientes, llam\u00f3 a los opositores por ocupar el cargo durante a\u00f1os pero no actuar con urgencia para sanar el trauma de la comunidad y mejorar las condiciones de los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latines.\u00a0El 3 de enero, Green invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a la oficina de su campa\u00f1a en la 87 y Halsted en el vecindario de Auburn Gresham. Cubierto con letreros de \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green para Alcalde\u201d, con un autob\u00fas de campa\u00f1a estacionado afuera de su oficina, anteriormente un bano Chase, se destaca en un centro comercial en ruinas. Para entrar a la oficina repleta de voluntarios, entre ellos los hijos de Green, tuvimos que presentar identificaciones con fotograf\u00eda.Durante nuestra entrevista, Green no se retract\u00f3 de su punto de vista cual tiene desde hace mucho tiempo sobre la policia y vigilancia.\u00a0\u201cNo invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero para aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia\u201d, dijo Green. En su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, Green pide una reforma policial que haga que \u201cla vigilancia sea m\u00e1s atractiva\u201d.Comparti\u00f3 ideas sobre la creaci\u00f3n de un banco p\u00fablico que sea propiedad de la ciudad que dar\u00eda a los residentes el poder de invertir en sus comunidades. Las prioridades del banco ser\u00edan viviendas asequibles, propiedad de viviendas, nuevos desarrollos y pr\u00e9stamos para peque\u00f1as empresas.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiere reducir la violencia a la mitad, crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios y lanzar \u201cuniversal 3K\u201d, cual es preescolar para ni\u00f1es de hasta tres a\u00f1os en adelante.\u00a0Sin embargo, sin ninguna experiencia pol\u00edtica ejecutiva, algunos votantes de Chicago se preguntan c\u00f3mo Green, el candidato m\u00e1s joven de la carrera, har\u00e1 realidad sus nobles ideas.\u00a0Adem\u00e1s, se le ha relacionado con algunas pol\u00e9micas en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En 2021, hizo circular rumores en las redes sociales sobre la renuncia de Lightfoot. \u00c9l tuite\u00f3: \u201cLori Lightfoot renunciar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana en un sorprendente final para su alcald\u00eda\u201d. M\u00e1s tarde se disculp\u00f3 y el tuit se elimin\u00f3 desde entonces.Cuando les organizadores de la liberaci\u00f3n liderado por mujeres Negras y queer en Chicago, como BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters y Let Us Breathe Collective, expresaron su oposici\u00f3n a la campa\u00f1a de Lightfoot del 2019 debido a su afiliaci\u00f3n con la junta de polic\u00eda, Green la respald\u00f3.\u00a0Dijo que la asesor\u00f3 en la Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud y durante la pandemia de COVID-19, pero luego los dos comenzaron a chocar. En el 2021 llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n a Lightfoot por bloquear su esfuerzo por convertir la escuela primaria Garrett Morgan en el vecindario de Auburn-Gresham, cerrada por Emanuel, en un centro juvenil de $15 millones.Y en diciembre del 2022, una disputa de a\u00f1os entre Green y el campo del oponente Willie Wilson se desbord\u00f3 cuando la grabaci\u00f3n de audio supuestamente entre el asesor pol\u00edtico de Wilson, Rickey Hendon, y el voluntario de la campa\u00f1a de Green, Kevin Hobby, se filtr\u00f3 en las redes sociales, detallando un soborno para que el equipo de Green abandonara la petici\u00f3n contra Wilson. Desaf\u00edo contra Wilson. En el 2019, Hendon desafi\u00f3 las firmas de petici\u00f3n de Green y Green se retir\u00f3 de la contienda.\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Green como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: La generaci\u00f3n de millennials de Chicago desafiaron las expectativas en las elecciones intermedias del 2022 como el segundo bloque de votantes m\u00e1s grande. En el 2012, los millennials Negros de Chicago, tras el asesinato policial de Rekia Boyd, tambi\u00e9n crearon el cimiento para el movimiento emergente de la liberaci\u00f3n Negra. Usted fue parte de la comunidad organizadora que busc\u00f3 justicia para Laquan McDonald. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el liderazgo de la generaci\u00f3n millennial a nivel de alcalde?Ja'Mal Green: Los habitantes de Chicago han visto que la pol\u00edtica de la ciudad no ha funcionado y no est\u00e1 en los mejores intereses de la clase trabajadora com\u00fan. Ahora estamos en un momento crucial en el que la generaci\u00f3n joven no tiene esperanza. Los j\u00f3venes mueren, cometen actos de violencia o son atrapados robando autos. Algunos est\u00e1n tratando de criar familias en Chicago.\u00a0Simplemente no hay ning\u00fan tipo de esperanza en este momento. Familias de toda la ciudad, se est\u00e1n yendo. Los negocios se van. Chicago est\u00e1 dispuesta a arriesgarse con alguien que tenga un plan, se preocupe por los ciudadanos comunes, sea m\u00e1s joven y presente ideas innovadoras.\u00a0Una de las cosas m\u00e1s importantes de esta carrera es que Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el cambio. Todav\u00eda tienen que obtener los resultados que han necesitado durante tanto tiempo. No se han sentido seguros durante tanto tiempo. [Los funcionarios electos] hicieron promesas que no cumplieron y [los residentes de Chicago] est\u00e1n listos para probar algo nuevo.Creciste en las \u00e1reas del sur y oeste de Chicago. \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 vivir en estas dos partes de la cuidad su pol\u00edtica y perspectiva de la vida?Crec\u00ed en Gresham. Ha sido mi hogar durante toda mi vida. La primera cuadra en la que viv\u00ed fue la 86 y Union. Esos eran propietarios que se preocupaban por la cuadra y todos los j\u00f3venes de la cuadra.Ten\u00eda al Sr. Riley, que acababa de morir, que me daba un d\u00f3lar por cada \"A\" que ten\u00eda, y ten\u00edamos un pueblo. Mirando hacia atr\u00e1s en todos los otros lugares en los que he vivido, no hay otro bloque como ese. Eso me dio una base que me mostr\u00f3 c\u00f3mo es un pueblo y c\u00f3mo las personas pueden unirse y amarse unos a otros y cuidarse unos a otros y cuidar a los hijos de los dem\u00e1s.Mi pap\u00e1 estaba en K-town. Lo visitaba para estad\u00edas prolongadas y los fines de semana. Vi las diferencias en cada lado de la ciudad, donde las comunidades no ten\u00edan los recursos que necesitaban, donde la gente sufr\u00eda y necesitaba servicios de salud mental, o carec\u00edan de un hogar, o algunos estaban involucrados en alg\u00fan tipo de actividad criminal porque no tengo alternativa. Todo lo que he visto en estos vecindarios me convirti\u00f3 en la persona que soy hoy para saber que necesitamos un enfoque pol\u00edtico m\u00e1s centrado en las personas.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se ingreso en la contienda por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago por segunda vez consecutiva? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no postularse para un puesto en el Concejo Municipal de Chicago?Ning\u00fan miembro del concejo municipal ha sido elegido alcalde de la ciudad de Chicago. Entonces, la segunda parte de eso es la visi\u00f3n, y la agenda que debe avanzar en nuestra ciudad debe avanzar en la parte superior, y es por eso que me postulo para alcalde.No busco ser un pol\u00edtico de carrera e ir de asiento en asiento. Busco tener el impacto que necesito tener a gran escala y luego apartarme del camino, pasar la antorcha e inspirar a otra generaci\u00f3n a dar un paso al frente. Me postul\u00e9 para alcalde la \u00faltima vez y me retir\u00e9 antes de la votaci\u00f3n.Esta es t\u00e9cnicamente mi primera candidatura porque en realidad estoy en la boleta electoral. No ten\u00edamos la infraestructura que necesit\u00e1bamos [en aquel entonces]. Esta vez tenemos mucho apoyo en toda la ciudad. El reconocimiento de mi nombre es muy alto en toda la ciudad. Las docenas de empresas y miles de personas que ayudaron a impulsar esta campa\u00f1a han sido asombrosas. As\u00ed que decid\u00ed participar esta vez porque me llamaron y porque la gente quiere una nueva voz, una voz joven que represente a todo Chicago.Los rumores, o simplemente lo que comenta la gente, es que la \u00faltima vez esperaba conseguir un puesto en la administraci\u00f3n de Lightfoot.No. Nunca trabajar\u00eda para una administraci\u00f3n. Porque no necesito hacerlo. Tengo muchos negocios, y ser\u00eda un conflicto para m\u00ed. Entonces, con Lori, la aconsej\u00e9 cuando me lo pidi\u00f3 y la ayud\u00e9 con las pol\u00edticas hasta que no pudimos llevarnos bien.\u00bfHay algo espec\u00edfico que puedas nombrar que estabas apoyando o aconsejando?S\u00ed. La Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud. Hice una peque\u00f1a serie con ella en l\u00ednea durante la pandemia desde el principio para ayudarla a hablar sobre COVID-19. Los videos tuvieron alrededor de 100.000 visitas en l\u00ednea y les fue bien.As\u00ed que trat\u00e9 de ayudarla a humanizarla y hacer que se quedara con pol\u00edticas reales que tuvieran sentido. Pero Lori es Lori. Al final del d\u00eda, reconozco por qu\u00e9 no nos ca\u00edmos bien durante seis a\u00f1os antes de eso. Solo trat\u00e9 de decir que quiero que la ciudad sea mejor, y no te estoy pidiendo nada. No necesito el dinero. no necesito nada No necesito un trabajo. Quiero estas pol\u00edticas para que estos j\u00f3venes tengan espacios y caminos para ser productivos.No pude lograr eso con ella y esta administraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed que me postulo para que esto suceda.Cuando se habla de violencia armada, muchas veces olvidan a les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine. Por lo general, usted habla sobre la violencia armada, especialmente cuando afecta a les ni\u00f1es. \u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 usted en la seguridad? \u00bfY hay formas fuera de la vigilancia en las que invertir\u00e1 en la seguridad? \u00bfPuede describir c\u00f3mo se ver\u00e1 esa inverci\u00f3n?Hoy lanzamos un plan de $5 mil millones. Eso se llama EPIC: Prevenci\u00f3n de la prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, intervenci\u00f3n y reforma del CPD. La base de nuestro programa es garantizar que creamos vecindarios pr\u00f3speros donde invertimos en los j\u00f3venes y donde CPD es un sistema de apoyo y no una fuerza opresiva. No invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero en aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia.\u00a0Adoptaremos un enfoque hol\u00edstico y haremos las cosas de la manera correcta. Entonces, cuando hablas de prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, nuestro n\u00famero de la suerte es 10,000. Queremos crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios de vivienda al instituir bonos hipotecarios unifamiliares y pr\u00e9stamos retroactivos a nivel de ciudad cada a\u00f1o para que podamos repoblar los vecindarios. Por lo tanto, las personas que est\u00e1n en esos vecindarios o se han ido y tienen ra\u00edces, ya sea que se muden a los suburbios o a otras ciudades, los incentivamos para que regresen respaldando su pr\u00e9stamo, brind\u00e1ndoles un pago inicial y asistencia para los costos de cierre.Me encantar\u00eda volver a eso porque tengo preguntas sobre viviendas asequibles y sobre las rentas de inquilinos.Entonces, una de las piezas se llama Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Esencialmente, de lo que se trata es de que vamos a tener un programa de asistencia directa en efectivo, donde vamos a dar $1,000 por mes a 10,000 familias cada a\u00f1o para sacarlas de la pobreza.Todos los participantes de este programa deber\u00e1n tomar una clase de educaci\u00f3n financiera. Luego, tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1n 90 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s del inicio de los pagos para hacer una de cuatro cosas: obtener vivienda, inscripci\u00f3n educativa, tratamiento por abuso de sustancias o asegurar una oportunidad de trabajo. Har\u00e1n una de esas cuatro cosas. Despu\u00e9s de eso, pueden continuar recibiendo asistencia en efectivo durante el a\u00f1o.\u00a0Los evaluaremos ese a\u00f1o y podr\u00e1n volver a presentar una solicitud para un segundo y \u00faltimo a\u00f1o. Con este programa de $150 millones, es importante brindar los cimientos a las personas que lo necesitan y sacarlos de la pobreza. Muchos estudios han demostrado que al proporcionar efectivo directo a personas que viven tiempos dif\u00edciles, la mayor parte de ese dinero se gasta en sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, ya sea vivienda, comida, etc.Ha dicho que quiere que los impuestos que paga la gente de Chicago dejen de ser usados para pagar la facturas que cubren los costos de las demandas por mala conducta policial. Tambi\u00e9n mencion\u00f3 que quer\u00eda que los polic\u00edas obtengan seguro. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso?Ese sigue siendo el caso. Todav\u00eda estamos examin\u00e1ndolo y averiguando c\u00f3mo implementarlo. No vamos a seguir pagando $100 millones por mala conducta policial. No va a suceder bajo mi supervisi\u00f3n, y ser\u00e1 una prioridad de mi administraci\u00f3n implementar y aprobar un plan para que ese proyecto de ley vaya a otra persona.Deber\u00eda ir en nombre de la polic\u00eda. Si tienen un seguro de responsabilidad civil, las compa\u00f1\u00edas de seguros pueden evaluar la responsabilidad sobre si son un riesgo en funci\u00f3n de sus quejas. Entonces, si obtienen casos de seguros de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, esa compa\u00f1\u00eda los dejar\u00e1. Si no tienen seguro, no pueden ser polic\u00edas en las calles de Chicago.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 debemos seguir permitiendo que los agentes de polic\u00eda acumulen millones de d\u00f3lares en acuerdos y no hay rendici\u00f3n de cuentas? Jason Van Dyke le dispar\u00f3 a Laquan 16 veces. Pero antes de ese caso, ya ten\u00eda acuerdos de seis cifras de casos en los que actu\u00f3 de manera inapropiada.Tenemos que empezar a responsabilizarlos. Tambi\u00e9n vamos a multar a los oficiales con hasta $5,000 si [ellos] apagan sus c\u00e1maras corporales o hacen un uso inadecuado del equipo.\u00a0Tendremos tolerancia cero con los agentes de polic\u00eda que se afilien a grupos de odio.Implementaremos una aplicaci\u00f3n en la que las personas puedan calificar sus interacciones con los agentes de polic\u00eda. Supongamos que tiene una interacci\u00f3n con la polic\u00eda. En ese caso, podr\u00e1 calificar al oficial de polic\u00eda, as\u00ed como cargar datos en tiempo real [para] tener evidencia de un caso. Pueden ir a una agencia de investigaci\u00f3n para poder verlo, y tambi\u00e9n podemos recompensar a los oficiales de polic\u00eda que obtienen buenas interacciones [de] la comunidad.Por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n vamos a ayudar a los polic\u00edas de la fuerza. Los suicidios est\u00e1n en su punto m\u00e1s alto. Vamos a aumentar la cantidad de terapeutas por distrito policial y vamos a cambiar nuestro horario de trabajo a una semana laboral de cuatro o tres d\u00edas con un d\u00eda de salud mental en el medio para que podamos comenzar a controlar las tasas de suicidio en el departamento de polic\u00eda.En su sitio de web, mencion\u00f3 que desea crear hogares de sanaci\u00f3n donde aquellos que sufren problemas de salud mental puedan encontrar refugio. Y tambi\u00e9n acaba de mencionar que se enviar\u00e1 un trabajador social capacitado a los hogares para reducir la tensi\u00f3n en situaciones que no sean de emergencia. Eso suena similar a la ordenanza de Treatment Not Trauma, tratamiento no trauma. \u00bfApoya esa ordenanza?Pasaremos Tratamiento No Trauma. Necesitamos reabrir las instalaciones de salud mental que cerr\u00f3 Rahm Emanuel.\u00bfCu\u00e1l es s\u00fa plan para eso?Planeamos reabrir cl\u00ednicas y encontrar los mejores lugares en las comunidades para abrir centros de bienestar que utilicen un enfoque hol\u00edstico de la salud mental. Ser\u00e1 una instituci\u00f3n donde podr\u00e1 obtener servicios de consejer\u00eda, yoga, boxeo, k\u00e1rate, masajes terap\u00e9uticos y tratamientos de spa.Necesitamos invertir en eso para que las personas de toda la ciudad, ya sean j\u00f3venes, polic\u00edas o quienes sean, puedan ver esta instituci\u00f3n como un lugar donde pueden relajarse. Nuestra idea innovadora es tomar lo que est\u00e1n haciendo y expandirlo a una instituci\u00f3n a la que todos quisieran ir.Como parte de la generaci\u00f3n de millennials usted parece estar m\u00e1s conectado con la juventud Negra y Latine en Chicago en formas que las otras campa\u00f1as no lo est\u00e1n, principalmente a trav\u00e9s de su trabajo con Majostee All Stars. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es importante para usted apoyar y elevar las voces de los j\u00f3venes de Chicago? \u00bfEs ese un compromiso que mantendr\u00e1 si es elegido como alcalde?Una de las cosas que consegu\u00ed que hiciera la actual alcalde fue transmitir mi idea de tener la primera Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud en la ciudad para asesorar a la oficina del alcalde. Es muy importante que se escuchen las voces de los j\u00f3venes. Una vez you fui joven. Todavia recuerdo cuando la gente dec\u00eda que estaba muy joven y que necesitaba quedarme en mi lugar y que mi voz no ten\u00eda mucha importancia.\u00a0Por eso es importante para m\u00ed asegurarme que se invierta en los j\u00f3venes y eliminar las barreras. Nuestros l\u00edderes se han aferrado constantemente al poder y al dinero; esencialmente, est\u00e1n esperando morir. Luego, cuando mueran, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el siguiente plan? Como no capacitan a la pr\u00f3xima generaci\u00f3n, no colocan a los j\u00f3venes en posiciones de poder. No invierten en los j\u00f3venes. Solo quieren que sigamos votando por ellos hasta que tengan 100 a\u00f1os. Eso no es justo. Eso no debe de ser as\u00ed. As\u00ed no es como deber\u00eda ser. Los j\u00f3venes necesitan la oportunidad de ocupar puestos para crecer y prosperar, y ese es mi compromiso.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?La calidad de la educaci\u00f3n debe ser determinada por el ingreso medio del vecindario. Uno de los mayores problemas de nuestra ciudad es que tenemos un sistema escolar de inscripci\u00f3n selectiva. Obtuvimos una f\u00f3rmula basada en la inscripci\u00f3n en el estado y comunidades desinvertidas. Por lo tanto, se ha desinvertido de las escuelas. Fui a muchas escuelas p\u00fablicas y tuve desaf\u00edos. Yo era uno de los ni\u00f1es m\u00e1s brillantes de todas las escuelas y tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda dificultades con mi comportamiento. Mostr\u00e9 ciertos comportamientos que las escuelas no estaban preparadas para abordar o para darme la atenci\u00f3n que necesitaba.Lo que sucede en el distrito es que si tienes un ni\u00f1e con desaf\u00edos, escribir\u00e1n un IEP (Programa de Educaci\u00f3n Individualizado) y tratar\u00e1n de obtener alg\u00fan medicamento o algo as\u00ed.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que no hay un enfoque hol\u00edstico real. Los j\u00f3venes de estos vecindarios que est\u00e1n pasando por tanto trauma, que tienen tanto dolor, que podr\u00edan estar sin hogar y hambrientos, entran a un edificio escolar y se espera que aprendan dos m\u00e1s dos sin el plan de estudios, los libros o la tecnolog\u00eda adecuados. Estamos fallando a los j\u00f3venes todos los d\u00edas en las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago.\u00a0Necesitamos asegurarnos de presionar a la legislatura estatal para que cambie la f\u00f3rmula para las escuelas p\u00fablicas. Debe estar basado en las necesidades. Queremos invertir para asegurarnos de que programas de entrenamiento de trabajo y trabajos tecnol\u00f3gicos est\u00e9n en las escuelas de toda la ciudad. Necesitamos alternativas para los j\u00f3venes y asegurarnos de que est\u00e9n aprendiendo habilidades y diferentes campos profesionales que puedan seguir.\u00a0Necesitamos invertir en los j\u00f3venes desde temprano. As\u00ed que estamos presentando un plan de preescolar para garantizar que haya programas y escuelas p\u00fablicas en toda la ciudad donde les ni\u00f1es de tan solo tres a\u00f1os puedan comenzar a aprender antes incluso de pasar al prek\u00ednder que los har\u00e1 m\u00e1s inteligentes y va a estimular sus mentes. Es bueno para las madres solteras que buscan cuidado de ni\u00f1os y quieren trabajar.Necesitamos ense\u00f1ar a estos j\u00f3venes temprano para que puedan tener las habilidades que necesitan para ser lo mejor que puedan ser cuando crezcan. Universal 3K es un plan que tambi\u00e9n queremos implementar.Los j\u00f3venes de Chicago tienen muy pocos lugares para reunirse y socializar de manera segura. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS?Necesitamos invertir en espacios seguros. Hay mucha gente en la ciudad que est\u00e1 haciendo un buen trabajo con los j\u00f3venes. No necesitamos reinventar lo que ya se esta haciendo o tener nosotros que ser la fuerza impulsora detr\u00e1s de todo. Necesitamos ver d\u00f3nde est\u00e1n las personas que hacen el trabajo e ir a ellas y decirles, \u201c\u00bfc\u00f3mo pueden expandirse? \u00bfCu\u00e1nto necesitas para expandirse?\u201d Para que podamos tener espacios realmente seguros donde los j\u00f3venes puedan crecer y prosperar. As\u00ed que destinaremos mucho dinero para crear espacios seguros para los j\u00f3venes en nuestras comunidades.\u00bfEst\u00e1 familiarizado con la ordenanza de GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfel apoyar esa ordenanza se alinea con su compromiso con la juventud de Chicago?S\u00ed, fui mentor de muchos j\u00f3venes involucrados en GoodKid MacCity\u2019s Peach Book a lo largo de los a\u00f1os. Armaron un buen plan.Estoy seguro de que hay algunos ajustes que podemos modificar y mejorar. El punto es que hay una organizaci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes que se presentan y dicen, \u201caqu\u00ed hay un plan\u201d, especialmente aquellos j\u00f3venes que arriesgan sus vidas diariamente y est\u00e1n al frente de todo. Necesitan una voz, \u00bfverdad? As\u00ed que ll\u00e9venlos a la mesa, escuchen el plan y vean c\u00f3mo podemos fortalecer ese plan, trabajar juntos y crear algo que funcione.En el video de su campa\u00f1a, anunci\u00f3 su deseo de apoyar y expandir que las personas sean propietarios de su vivienda. Anteriormente en nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, habl\u00f3 sobre querer obtener 10,000 o m\u00e1s nuevos propietarios en el futuro. Tiene un marco o iniciativa existente que cre\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de la organizaci\u00f3n My Turn to Own. \u00bfEs ese un modelo que cree que se puede usar a mayor escala? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?My Turn to Own es una organizaci\u00f3n que ense\u00f1a a las personas c\u00f3mo convertirse en propietarios de viviendas y les brinda la educaci\u00f3n financiera que necesitan. Luego, despu\u00e9s de someterlos al proceso y lograr que sean due\u00f1os de una casa, tambi\u00e9n les ense\u00f1amos c\u00f3mo mantener esa casa en el proceso.\u00a0Esto es muy importante porque respaldaremos pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios a gran escala. Hay personas en comunidades que ni siquiera conocen sus puntajes de cr\u00e9dito y ni siquiera saben c\u00f3mo calificar porque han estado alquilando durante tantas d\u00e9cadas que nunca ha estado en su radar. Entonces esa ser\u00e1 una pieza clave de nuestra administraci\u00f3n para expandir algo as\u00ed en toda la ciudad.Muchos de nuestros lectores son inquilinos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas implementar\u00e1 para proteger a las personas del desplazamiento y apoyar a las personas sin hogar?Tenemos que aumentar la cantidad de viviendas asequibles. No tiene sentido que ni siquiera podamos construir 2,500 unidades de viviendas asequibles al a\u00f1o. Daremos subsidios fiscales a las grandes tiendas, iglesias, bancos y personas que poseen grandes edificios para construir unidades de viviendas asequibles. Incentivaremos a las personas a construir sobre cualquier espacio de un solo piso o un edificio de un solo piso.\u00a0El Banco P\u00fablico es otra gran pieza de la que hablo mucho. Crearemos nuestro propio motor econ\u00f3mico al tener un banco p\u00fablico que invierta en pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios, casas asequibles y peque\u00f1as empresas. Esa ganancia del banco vuelve directamente a los servicios de la ciudad.As\u00ed que vamos a construir viviendas basadas en ingresos en la ciudad de Chicago, y el sector p\u00fablico tendr\u00e1 mucho control sobre esas rentas. Luego, como parte de incentivar esas unidades de vivienda asequible, tambi\u00e9n nos aseguraremos de que existan criterios para mantener los precios accesibles de renta de las unidades que est\u00e1n construyendo.Soy alguien que apoya mucho el tener establecido acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios para que los desarrolladores privados que est\u00e1n construyendo sepan que tienen que seguir esos acuerdos. No podemos esperar a que un desarrollador privado venga al vecindario a construir unidades de vivienda asequibles.Apoya Bring Chicago Home, la iniciativa llamada Regresar Chicago a Casa?S\u00ed, apoyo la propuesta de Bring Chicago Home de tener un flujo de financiaci\u00f3n dedicado para personas sin hogar y viviendas asequibles.Anteriormente en la conversaci\u00f3n, mencion\u00f3 a qui\u00e9n usted asume su responsabilidad. Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?Pondremos diferentes cosas en su lugar para permitir que los organizadores tengan un asiento en la mesa. Por ejemplo, estamos buscando una comisi\u00f3n, una especie de agente de poder, donde los organizadores laborales y la gente en primera l\u00ednea pueden tener una gran voz en la oficina del alcalde.\u00a0Eso es clave para m\u00ed. Esperamos rendir cuentas por todo lo que decimos. Estoy en la contienda hablando de lo que voy a hacer lo cual es parte de mi historial de lo que he hecho. Soy el \u00fanico candidato con un historial de hacer todas estas cosas.\u00a0Cuando llegas al gobierno, las cosas pueden cambiar. Por eso la gente no conf\u00eda en los pol\u00edticos. Estoy tratando de cambiar eso. Quiero la confianza de la gente de Chicago y, por lo tanto, en todo lo que diga, har\u00e9 todo lo posible para mantener mi palabra. Estamos siempre abiertos a que la gente nos recuerde que tenemos que asumir nuestra responsabilidad. Este es un juego de palabras, y le doy mi palabra a la gente de Chicago."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ald. Roderick Sawyer",
  "text": "Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward) is no stranger to Chicago politics. He\u2019s served in the City Council since 2011, when he defeated Freddrenna Lyle, who was appointed by then-mayor Richard M. Daley in 1998.\u00a0Sawyer was born and raised \u2014 and still resides \u2014 in Park Manor, one of the neighborhoods he represents in City Council, just like his father did. Like Daley, Sawyer is the son of a former Chicago mayor.\u00a0Following the death of Harold Washington, Sawyer\u2019s father, Ald. Eugene Sawyer, was tapped by a bloc of white aldermen to be mayor over Washington ally Timothy Evans. He served for two years until his defeat by Daley in the 1989 mayoral election. Daley maintained power for nearly three decades, longer than any other Chicago mayor. Sawyer explained that he follows in his father\u2019s footsteps not for family legacy, but as a public servant.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it,\u201d he said.\u00a0As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, Sawyer invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 5 to Oooh Wee It Is, a Black-owned restaurant in Chatham known for its Southern comfort food.\u00a0Currently, Sawyer serves as chairman of the City Council\u2019s Health and Human Relations Committee. In addition, he was chair of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus and the co-chair of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0He said that his record in City Council and the fact that he has garnered the support and trust of his colleagues in the chamber prove that he\u2019s equipped to be Chicago\u2019s next mayor.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had groundbreaking legislation introduced and passed in City Council, so I have a proven ability to get things done,\u201d Sawyer said.\u00a0During his tenure in City Council, he has championed issues such as the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that established an elected civilian board of Chicago residents to oversee the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the fight for a $15 minimum wage, the push for an elected representative school board and GoodKids MadCity\u2019s Peace Book Ordinance.\u00a0He\u2019s also voted in favor of unpopular measures, including Emanuel\u2019s 2011 budget, which passed unanimously and closed six of the city\u2019s 12 mental health facilities, and a 2017 move to acquire property in West Garfield Park for a cop academy, which passed 48 to 1.During our conversation, Sawyer discussed his plans to address violence, mental health, youth, housing, reparations for Black Chicagoans and more.\u00a0He is not calling to increase or decrease the CPD\u2019s budget. Instead, according to his public safety plan, he wants to recruit more police officers, fix the city\u2019s emergency response system, improve officer wellness, invest in comprehensive police training and more. In addition, he supports Treatment Not Trauma, wants to address the root causes of violence and calls for revitalizing neighborhoods that have seen decades-long disinvestment.As an alder, he voted in line with mayor Rahm Emanuel 100 percent of the time from April 2017 to November 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Read our full interview with Sawyer, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: How did growing up in Park Manor shape your politics? Ald. Roderick Sawyer: Growing up in Park Manor and still living here today is quite a testament to the neighborhood and the people there. When I was growing up, I saw it at its best. I've seen it struggling, and I've seen it in challenging times. It never eliminated my resolve to want to stay here and try to improve upon what's here.I'm very adamant about where I came from. I spend an inordinate amount of time in my neighborhood because I feel strongly about the people here. They formed me into who I am now. So as a lawyer, as a business person and as a resident, it is overwhelming the love I get from my Park Manor neighbors, my Chatham neighbors, because we've all come through that struggle. We were all little kids together, delinquents, playing in the alleys and riding our bikes throughout the area. So for me to stay here and choose to be here is not a testament to me, but it's a testament to the others around me. So that is extremely important.You are the son of Chicago's second Black mayor, Eugene Sawyer. Yes.When the City Council was selecting a successor after the passing of Harold Washington, there was concern that appointing your father to the role would mean a return to machine politics. Also, most of the support he received from the chamber came from white alderpersons who were obstructionists to then-mayor Harold Washington and his agenda. There were also some accusations from some in the community that accused your father of selling out to white politicians.\u00a0\u00a0Why are you entering the race? Is it to follow in your father's footsteps? What did you learn from your father about public service?Well, let's just make some corrections. First, my father was chosen because he was the best candidate for that position. It was a troubling time after our friend Harold Washington died.My father was both chairman of the Rules Committee and president pro tempore. So that meant he ran the Rules Committee, and when Harold stepped out, he took over the mantle. That was an enormous amount of responsibility given to my father. No one has ever held two committee chairs at the same time besides him. So I give that as a testament of trust from the mayor to my father. The mayor knew that the job was going to get done. Furthermore, when Harold died, my father passed every initiative that Harold sought to pass and was unable to because of his untimely death. Even things that were against his own personal interests.My father was a devotee of Harold Washington. So all that talk was nonsense about him being beholden to white interests. My father was a proud Black man from this neighborhood [Park Manor] and Greensboro, Alabama. A person that stood there protecting Martin Luther King\u2019s house while he was at Alabama State.\u00a0\u00a0So all that noise people made back then was very troubling. It was disheartening because my father\u2019s interests were for his residents, the city, Chicago and the 6th Ward.\u00a0To answer your ultimate question, though, my father taught me a lot about how important it is to be a good steward of your community and how important public service is. So in that regard, yes, I am following my father\u2019s footsteps, not as mayor but as a public servant here in an area where I was born and raised, and because of that and what I saw from him, how people held him in high esteem because he helped those that were in this neighborhood. So I wanted to continue in that service. I\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it.I read that you feel that crime is our city's most pressing issue. Yet, if elected, you said you would first fire CPD Police Supt. David Brown. Is that still the case? Why or why not?I think our biggest problem is crime anxiety. That means no matter where you live in the city. If you go outside, you feel there\u2019s a chance that something might happen to you. That\u2019s the anxiety, and that has a financial cost.\u00a0Those that are of means don\u2019t go out because they feel that anxiety. That means they don\u2019t spend money at restaurants, bars and theaters and gyms, breweries and health clubs and all the things that we would expect them to spend money [on].When I saw David Brown down in Dallas, I was encouraged. I thought he would be a good superintendent because he supported his police officers down in Dallas. I saw that he was hard on crime and a tough guy. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not getting that same guy here right now. This is not the same David Brown.If elected, I would use that opportunity to use the platform that I worked on for seven years, the Empowering Communities for Public Safety, or ECPS [ordinance].I'm proud to say I was the lead sponsor of the ECPS ordinance, that I helped bring it to fruition. So we'll be electing community-based members to reestablish the trust between the community and the police and when we do that, people will feel more comfortable about talking to the police. That means they'll give police more information, which means we can solve more crimes, so that's how that works. It's a ripple effect.So I am a big proponent of that. I will also use that same platform to choose a superintendent that has the respect of the police department, of the rank and file, that has been through the system, that understands what we need in order to have officers laser focus on their job, which is to apprehend bad guys and bound them over for trial.Do you believe in increasing or decreasing CPD's budget? How do you feel the police budget should be allocated? We should have the resources necessary to respond to service calls. The City of Chicago is in a service business. That's especially true for the police. Police are a service. They're public servants; they serve you and serve everyone here.So if we don't have enough officers to respond to calls and it takes more than an hour to respond to calls, that's a problem. That's increasing that same anxiety I talked about. So now I've got robbed, I call the police, and no one shows up. That feels like no one's protecting me. That's that continued anxiety. So it won't make me feel better if no one shows up.\u00a0\u00a0So here\u2019s what we're talking about doing for nonviolent calls, let's say, unfortunately, you got robbed, but you're okay. You don\u2019t get harmed. They took your wallet, purse or car. You can call 9-1-1, and we can send somebody over to get a report from you, a uniformed officer. It can be a retired officer that knows how to take the report and get descriptions from you and pass on that information to those on the street that can hopefully apprehend that suspect or that offender and get them bound over for trial.How will you be investing in safety? Based on what you said, does that mean that you would hire more police officers?I would hire police officers where appropriate. I would make sure that we get past the level of retirements and defections. People are leaving. And ensure that it's not an either-or approach. I believe in getting the officers staffed to the appropriate level. Maybe it's retired officers or civilians that we need to hire to get those officers that we need to get on the street.\u00a0We may just need to reallocate some positions. But that doesn't mean we should not invest in mental health services, job opportunities, employment training, drug and substance abuse, or addiction. No, it's a both-and approach. We need to invest in all of those things.Are there other ways outside of police that you would invest in safety? Again, invest in mental health services treatment response that, maybe, someone can de-escalate a situation instead of arresting somebody. We can provide drug addiction services to those that are dependent. We need to invest in both of those things. It's not a do this and don't do that. You do both.In 2020, you proposed removing CPD from CPS in City Council. Has your opinion on that changed? Why or why not?Well, let me say this. My goal was not to remove police officers from schools. I wanted to spark a conversation on what police officers do in certain schools and how it sometimes has a negative effect on its students. I\u2019m glad it worked out the way it did because schools now make a choice. They can choose whether they want officers in their school or don\u2019t want officers, and it\u2019s a school LSC [Local School Council] choice. I\u2019m really happy with the way it came out.\u00a0People just misconstrued my goal. My goal was to spark a discussion, which it did. Sometimes you have to do bold things, and that\u2019s why you need a leader that will not be afraid to make a bold decision. I didn\u2019t make a rash decision; I made a bold decision.\u00a0We ended up saving some money. We saved several million dollars for those schools that chose not to have officers in their school and those that kept officers in schools that were happy with their officers. It empowered LSCs and others to make decisions on the future of their schools, which I'm happy that I did.Many of your colleagues voted in favor of Mayor Lightfoot's proposal to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth despite critics saying it would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth. You were one of the Black alders that voted against it. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? How would you fund these plans?We were thinking about how to keep them away, as opposed to how we engage with them and have them in a safe space where they can enjoy themselves, and when it's time to go home, they'll go home. They're tired, and they had a good time. We provided something good for them, and the organizers made a little money. That's how I made money as a kid. I threw parties. I was a DJ, threw parties, and was involved in that.\u00a0So I don't see that in youth right now. That's why they're so frustrated they don't have anywhere to let off that steam. When you're young, you have a lot of pent-up energy that you need to release, so that's dancing and acting silly for a minute. We needed to provide that for them. So they get frustrated, and they're going to act out, and that's what happened and that's a failure on our part.As an alderperson, you voted to shut down half of the city's mental health clinics during then-mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration. Yet, on your campaign website, you said you support Treatment Not Trauma. If you support Treatment Not Trauma, why did you vote to close those mental health clinics?When I was elected, I came in as chairman of the health and human relations committee, and the first thing I did was visit the remaining mental health centers. They were empty.\u00a0\u00a0There were hardly any patients at any level. I visited all of them. They said no alder ever visited them. I\u2019ve visited all of them. The first thing I did was to look at all of them and see what the resources were and if they were busy. Did we need to provide more resources?Back when I made that vote about the mental health centers, I did an article a couple of years later, and I said if I could take one vote back, the only vote I would take back was the closing of the mental health service [clinics]. We should have dived into that further.I don\u2019t think they shouldn\u2019t have been closed. We should have dived into it a bit further to find out why the administration wanted them closed. We did not do that; it was a cost-cutting money-saving measure. My eyes were opened when I visited them and realized that we were not using them. We were not advertising for them, and we\u2019re not promoting them. It wasn\u2019t known that they existed and that people could go there for free.\u00a0I realized they weren\u2019t accepting children. Because of our advocacy, they\u2019re caring for children now. They\u2019re expanding their hours, and they\u2019re starting to put promotions on. So I played a role in ensuring the administration became aware of a problem related to our mental health service.As you know, voters in your ward overwhelmingly supported the Treatment Not Trauma ballot referendum during the 2022 midterm. If elected, how would you fund the specific plans under the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance?We have funding available for Treatment Not Trauma. The Department of Health has a robust budget. We can fund Treatment Not Trauma, with no problems. Because that money is earmarked for certain things, we can have that money available for things like mental health services. We can use the money that's available now.\u00a0It's not as much a funding issue. It's an intentionality issue. Do people want this to happen? I don't see why you would not want it. You can save someone's life by providing them with mental health services instead of bringing in a police officer.\u00a0A police officer is trained to do a certain thing. Police officers are trained to apprehend and arrest. That's their job. It is needed in certain instances: when someone's robbing you, you want the police. When someone's having a mental health breakdown, you don't want the police. You want a mental health expert. You want somebody that can say, \u201ccalm down,\u201d or direct you to proper services. You need that kind of calming, de-escalating voice that could assist you.The COVID-19 pandemic has already highlighted existing disparities in schools with funding and resources, especially for Black and brown students. What policies will you enact in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school.We're about to have an elected representative school board that will be autonomous and work independently. In the interim, I will ensure that the schools have all the necessary resources to make them successful. I'm a big proponent of neighborhood schools.\u00a0\u00a0I want to ensure that we're getting all the resources possible to the most students because that's what's important. The future of our city is our children. I want to ensure that whatever we do, as relates to Chicago Public Schools, is in the right vein, without doing something crazy. I've worked with CTU [Chicago Teachers Union] in the past, and I'll continue to work with CTU going into the future. I'm just not beholden to CTU.\u00a0 I'm not going to be dictated to by anyone.How will you fund plans to invest in neighborhood schools?I've been around a long time, and I've been an LSC Chairman for 12 years as well. I've always been of the opinion that we run a lean, mean ship, as relates to your school finances. Money spent on certain ridiculous things sometimes has to be looked at and has to be eliminated. So you want to make sure that the schools can operate independently, within the confines of their budget based on student formula. That needs to be changed, but that's part of it. I think that's part of a longer discussion that has to be done with the state. I am going to dive into those types of things. Because when I talk about resetting Chicago, these are the types of things that we need to be resetting.Who will you appoint to this hybrid board?I would like a mix of educators, community people and those interested in our children's future. I don't think I have a tried-and-true set measure of who I want to appoint as far as people. Still, you want people in the financial industry so they understand how to operate budgets and adhere to them. You want educators, so we have a proper plan for all students, not just the high-performing ones.\u00a0You also want people that can engage parents and other committee members to get involved in what's happening in the schools. Schools should be open all day and evening, with resources and programs for students, and if necessary, parents. Sometimes parents need some additional training or education. So you want all that to happen, and that school should be that center of that neighborhood with all those resources in one place.You mentioned that you\u2019ve worked with the Chicago Teachers Union. Is there a specific plan or proposal that you have to fund schools? Because I was looking at your website, it wasn't clear what those policies would look like. Funding comes from a variety of sources: some from property taxes, some from our state and federal government, some from the city of Chicago. We want to make sure that we look at all those funding sources and see how they\u2019re operating.We keep increasing school funding, even though the number of enrollments keeps going down, something's not making sense. Once I can get there, take a look at it, and dive into it, we'll see what the problem is. Is it heavy on the front end? Does CPS hold too much real estate that's not performing? Is it budgetary issues? Do we have too many assistant directors and assistant commissioners in the front office and need more people on the frontline teaching our children?I know that many schools have eliminated the APs [assistant principals]. But, for example, that should not happen. We removed assistants in kindergarten and first grade, where now you have a teacher alone with 35 five-year-olds. Not a sustaining method, and it won\u2019t improve education.\u00a0\u00a0So I would like to look into these things and ensure that we\u2019re doing what\u2019s right by our students, not necessarily by the union [CTU] or front office personnel. We have to focus on what\u2019s important, and it\u2019s those children.Our readers are curious about taxes. So would what you\u2019re proposing to do require raising property taxes?No, that's a last resort. I will say that many candidates use this as a selling point about saying \"no taxes\" or \"never tax.\" You should have a responsible tax policy.\u00a0 A responsible tax policy, for example, as it relates to real estate taxes, is small, incremental steps in improving taxes.\u00a0If our CPI [consumer price index] goes up, we should have a small raise in property taxes to reflect the increased cost of goods and services. So if that happens, we need to make that incremental change instead of what we've been doing now, saying everything's fine. \u201cNo, we don't need to raise taxes ever, ever, ever until after an election to, \u201coh, we got to raise taxes.\u201d That's irresponsible, and it's wrong. We should be looking at more responsible tax policies, something that people won't even notice a one to two percent increase in their taxes every so often.If the CPI goes down, then we can look at rebates and maybe refunds for those that pay taxes. But again, only if the financial picture looks like it's warranted, not just because people like to hear it and we don't do it. That's what got us into the problem in the first place about not paying our pension obligations and not raising taxes to do necessary things, as opposed to doing popular things.Chicago is a city full of vibrant neighborhoods. But it\u2019s becoming difficult for many people to remain in the city. There are new developments that are coming in the center of neighborhoods. I\u2019m speaking specifically about Bally's casino project. You voted in favor of that. So what policies will you enact to support homeowners and renters from displacement and or people experiencing homelessness?I did vote in favor of that. One, we do have a very robust budget right now for homelessness. The problem is we only spent about 5 percent of the money. We have a lot of money sitting there just waiting to spend on homeless initiatives. We're sometimes looking in the wrong direction. I don't want to spend money that will benefit developers more than it benefits the homeless. That's where I really have a problem, and I stand by that.\u00a0\u00a0So when people talk about things like Bring Chicago Home, I love what the intention is. But when you peel back the onion, and I peeled back the onion, developers would tend to benefit more than the homeless people will. We can help the homeless right now. We can almost eradicate homelessness except for a couple of issues.\u00a0We have money to house the people that we count. Most of them don't want to go into the types of structures we've been used to building. They'd rather be in that community that they're in off of Roosevelt Road on the expressway because at least they know that they're going to care for each other. That\u2019s where their community is.\u00a0We may not understand it. I've talked to enough homeless people to know that sometimes the help they're looking for is not the help that we're used to providing. If we're saying, I can take care of you and put you in a shelter. They don't want to be in a shelter. They know they've been robbed and raped and assaulted in shelters, they have a bad experience in the shelters, they don't want to go back.\u00a0Let's talk about giving them resources, treatment, opportunity, employment, and training, to get them to a space where we can get them a starter home or starter apartment, and then they can continue to get the treatment or work experience to earn money. That's what I look at. I look at more organic solutions, not just saying, hey, let's plop them in a flophouse down in a mission and we've done our part. That's short-sighted.I remember being at a meeting where you were with other Black elected officials. At the meeting, you explained how challenging it is for you and your colleagues to represent parts of Englewood because it has so many vacant and abandoned properties. What are your plans to revitalize neighborhoods, like Englewood, with many vacant areas/properties? What we don't do is give our Black developers and all minority developers, for that sake, resources and opportunities to develop in their backyards and their homes. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, you name it. We have abandoned areas all over the city, and could benefit from developers coming. No downtown developer is going to come out here, and they'll tell you the same thing. I\u2019ve had a developer tell me if I build in Fulton Market, I can get this much per unit rent or sell it. If I build out here, I can\u2019t get this much unless you can find the difference. What's my incentive in coming out here to build?\u00a0We got African American builders that will build. We\u2019d have to relax some of the union issues, and other issues to give them a leg up to do quality developments here on the South and the West sides.\u00a0We need to start doing that and getting these developers engaged so they can no longer be small developers. They'll have a goal and a mindset to deal more in a neighborhood that helped raise them as opposed to just going downtown.They can build a block at a time. Maybe two or three developers, then build the entire block then we can do another block. Because I literally have blocks of vacant land in this little area of Englewood that I have. I know my colleagues have even larger swaths of land that could be developed and sold or rented, or whatever the case may be, to homeowners who are working, but they need help to make ends meet.\u00a0We can get them that quality, affordable housing out here. Close to the L line. If they're working downtown, they can pop on the L in 15 minutes, then be at work or school or whatever the case may be. We need to start looking at that instead of just being downtown centric. However, I know how important downtown is to our bottom line. But it's not the end all be all.Black Chicagoans have been leaving for the city in droves since the 2000s for many reasons. But I wonder what specific policies or plans your administration will enact so we don't lose more Black Chicagoans. We must have a marketing plan for bringing people back home to Chicago. It should literally be: bring Chicagoans back home. We need to engage with marketing people, preferably Black people. Chicago is a great city. Chicago has plenty of amenities. It's a world-class city. We can trim off the problematic things and get those vibrant. There's no other city better.\u00a0We need to promote that and make an investment. Sometimes you have to invest to get something back. I don't like spending money just to be spending money; giveaways and gimmicks are not my thing. So we're going to make true investments in Chicago, invest in the future of Chicago, ensuring that people know how great Chicago is and the amenities we can provide them.\u00a0Englewood can be restored to great glory. It's intentionality who's at the head, spearheading that, and has that sense of vision to say that we can do this here in Englewood, we can do this in East Garfield Park, we can do this in Lawndale. We can do this and all these other challenging areas, like Pilsen and Little Village. We can do it in areas that have been marginalized in the past. It takes the leader at the top to say, this is what we're going to do, and this is how we will do it.How do we fund that?There are a variety of ways to fund it. There's bond funding. There are a lot of different funding mechanisms, particularly in blighted areas. We will work with our partners in the state and federal government. We might have to issue bonds. We had to issue some debt in order to get some of the things done and kick-start it.\u00a0 There's a variety of ways. We're not broke. We sometimes struggle because we make bad decisions, and we need to make fewer bad decisions and more financially conservative decisions that make sense. You make investments; you don't spend money.Speaking of investment in Black Chicago and keeping Black people here, should reparations be at the forefront in 2023?I feel it should be. I've been trying to push reparations for years. After learning more about it, I introduced it to the City Council.The mayor told me: \u201cI wasn't doing \"s---\" about reparations; that's nothing but a Willie Wilson gimmick.\u201dMr. Wilson was helping us financially with getting the word out about reparations. He was learning about reparations as well. We were doing what we could to show how important the repair part was. I\u2019ve talked to epidemiologists and epigeneticists.The problems that we have currently go back to us being enslaved and going through the Jim Crow Era, and the redlining and all the things that we\u2019ve gone through over decades and decades, and it makes us react a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0We need to dive into that and find out what that problem is, and once we do that, everybody benefits. So I\u2019m not as interested in something other than the 40 acres and mule money type of thing. That\u2019s more of a federal conversation. Mine is more the health disparities, educational disparities and things like that that are important, and there\u2019s a reason for that. There\u2019s a reason for that, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve dove into it enough. There\u2019s a word for that. The mayor [Lightfoot] would not use the word reparations. If you ask her, she would not say reparations.Your initial plan was just getting a commission?We've done enough studying. It wasn\u2019t about a study. I wanted a reparations commission equal to Streets and Sanitation and the Department of Transportation. I wanted an executive-level commission on reparations to discuss the repair we need as descendants of enslaved Africans.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't get support. I couldn't even get Black support. It was difficult because people didn't understand it. I remember having a few of my colleagues go to a couple of meetings because I had to have off-site meetings, and I could not get a meeting in council.\u00a0Under my administration, reparations will be at the forefront. We got to talk about it. We have to do it. We have to understand, and I want more people to understand. I want white people and everybody to understand it because it's vital for all.I noticed that you don't necessarily have large-scale endorsements like your other opponents in the race.No, because I'm not beholden to anybody in this race.So who are you accountable to?I'm accountable to the citizens of the city of Chicago. These are the people I hold in high esteem, and I feel accountable to everyday residents, people that go to work every day, unemployed people, people that are struggling and people that do well. I represent true Chicagoans, those that want good schools, vibrant business districts, safe streets and to enjoy their neighborhoods and go home safely. These are the people that I represent. These are the people that support me.I had to look at some previous articles and interviews to prepare my questions today because your website doesn\u2019t have a policy platform written out in detail at the time of this interview. How can Chicago voters be confident in you as a policymaker and hold you accountable for your campaign promises?I've been as prodigious on policy matters as any alderman in the City Council. From anti-privatization to police reform to business initiatives, I've shown my chops in bringing things forward and getting things done.\u00a0The elected representative school board, we were there \u2014 labor peace at the airports and childcare. These are things that I was always at the forefront of, leading, not just voting for it \u2014 leading, advocating getting votes, whipping votes for it, and passing it.\u00a0My history speaks for itself. I have the background. I have proven that I can work within different committees. I work with DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] members. I work with the conservative caucus. I work with the veteran's caucus, I work with everyone. I ensure that my ordinances get support from all levels of representation on the council. That's what you'll get from Mayor Sawyer."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Mayor Lori Lightfoot",
  "text": "The 2019 version of Lori Lightfoot made a lot of promises on the campaign trail. She told The TRiiBE she would stop the cop academy in its tracks, adding that her biggest problem with it was that then-mayor Rahm Emanuel didn\u2019t engage with the surrounding community about it. She invoked the spirit of Harold Washington at her inauguration, promising \u201csafe streets and strong schools for every child regardless of neighborhood or ZIP code.\u201d She\u2019d convinced many voters that she was the progressive mayor Chicago needed after eight years of Emanuel.Black and brown organizers warned us, though.\u00a0Soon after her inauguration, Mayor Lori Lightfoot quickly changed her tune. In July 2019, she announced that the $95 million price tag for the unpopular new cop academy would increase to an unspecified number. A supporter of an elected school board on the campaign trail, she opposed the plan, which Governor Pritzker signed over her objections in 2021.From the start, Lightfoot has fought with the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) over everything from their contract to COVID-19 safety measures. Five months after she took office, the union went on strike for two weeks to demand better pay and more nurses and librarians. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) joined the teachers, who won many of their demands. The mayor has had an icy relationship with the union since.In 2020, she stood in a West Garfield Park neighborhood and threatened to \u201ctreat you like a criminal\u201d for gathering during the pandemic. That same year she shut down the CTA, raised bridges to seal off the Loop and publicly fought with State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx for not charging more people during the Black Summer uprisings.\u00a0\u201cIn an emergency, I did what was necessary to make sure we kept Chicagoans safe,\u201d Lightfoot told The TRiiBE. \u201cI make no apologies for those. That absolutely was necessary and to save lives.\u201dOn Jan. 12, Lightfoot invited The TRiiBE to CS Insurance Strategies in the Loop for our Black mayoral candidate series. The night before, news broke about her campaign soliciting volunteers through CPS emails. We met with Lightfoot about an hour before her 3:00 p.m. press conference; initially, we were scheduled to meet with Lightfoot on Jan. 4 but she rescheduled due to Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s trip to Chicago.During our interview, Lightfoot emphasized investing in street outreach for violence reduction, promoted Invest South/West and doubled down on her Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement (CARE) pilot program, an alternative to Treatment Not Trauma that sends a mental health counselor along with a police officer out to 9-1-1 mental health calls. An expansion of the CARE pilot program doesn\u2019t include an officer; only a Chicago Fire Department community paramedic and a Chicago Department of Public Health mental health clinician.When it comes to policing, she said people in neighborhoods plagued by violence don\u2019t want to defund CPD. Instead, she said, they want more police. She added that the city has to make sure that the officers are well trained and respect constitutional policing practices.\u00a0\u201cLook, I press you to find a more progressive mayor than I\u2019ve been,\u201d Lightfoot said.Read our full interview with Lightfoot below, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: I know you have a hard stop time and a lot of things to do today. I would be remiss if I didn't ask about the situation that's going on with CPS emails right now. I know you have a press conference happening at three o'clock today. But if you can answer our questions\u2026Mayor Lori Lightfoot: Sure. Let me just lay it out for you. Late yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to campaign which we've been \u2014 there's a lot of enthusiasm and support among young people across the city \u2014 a campaign staffer accessed\u00a0 publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers, sent them in essence, posting about the internship opportunities and asked them to forward it on to any students who might be interested. Obviously, that was a mistake. We have from day one erected not just a line, but a wall between the campaign, political side, any official side. This young woman understands the magnitude of the issue that\u2019s now been created. I think she's horribly mortified that it happened. I explained to her personally, why this could not happen, what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff, again today, to her yesterday, obviously, but again to the entire staff today. And as I said, it was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened, and I'm confident it won't happen again.The first time I learned about it was yesterday [Eds note: January 11, when WTTW broke the story]. I\u2019m not just a candidate. I'm the mayor. And I'm not in the weeds at that level. Obviously I know that there's an effort to generate volunteers. But do I know about the specifics? Micromanaging? No, absolutely not.If another mayoral candidate reached out to CPS teachers, for campaign volunteers in this way, how would you respond to such action?I\u2019d have the same reaction. But it's different for me, I'm the mayor, right? The school system reports up to me. I can't really account for what other candidates may do. I'm the mayor. And the line has to be very, very clear, rigidly enforced and executed with fidelity. As I said, it was a mistake that shouldn't have happened. We're owning it. And we're gonna move on from here and do everything we can to build in not only the talking but the safeguards to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.In your safety plan, the first thing you list is that your administration has increased funding for community approaches to violence reduction by 1,400 percent, with a focus on high-risk violent individuals and supporting victims of violence. How much funding exactly has gone towards those community approaches? And what organizations or people are receiving this funding?I can\u2019t tell you the specific organizations because that\u2019s not something that, I wish, were RFPs. A lot of this is federal money. But here\u2019s what I can tell you. Number one, we know that what\u2019s important is to use every tool in our toolkit to make communities safe. Obviously, law enforcement plays a role, and making sure they\u2019re engaged in constitutional policing. But we got to go after other people who are trafficking in illegal guns, because that\u2019s the biggest driver of our violence. And when we see people that are involved in the illegal gun trade, we got to hold those people accountable. Because every illegal gun in our city has the potential to destroy lots and lots of lives forever, right? So that is a big, huge focus, working with our federal partners, making sure that we\u2019re being proactive in those investigations to hold violent, dangerous people accountable.But we also know that we can't just arrest our way out of the problem. We got to invest our way out of the problem. And what that means is we've got to look at using soft power tools. So we've made pretty historic investments in street outreach. And there's a number of street outreach organizations across the city that we fund. We've increased that funding from when I started office to, like\u2013it was about $1 million or $2 million a year that the city was funding. We're now I think, and we\u2019ll get you precise numbers, but I think it's about $58 million on an annualized basis.It\u2019s a combination of some ARPA dollars, it\u2019s some money from cannabis that we get, and we\u2019ve floated several bonds to pay for some of the investments that we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve also supported community organizations.We're trying to rebuild and reinvigorate the block club structure. We focus investments on vacant lots, because that's another big driver, mental health. Sometimes people don't think about that as a violence reduction tool. I believe that it is. And as of the end of last year, we now have  free, culturally relevant mental health services. In every single one of our 77 neighborhoods, that's a seven fold increase. We went from where I started, where the city was servicing about 2,500 residents a year. We ended last year servicing about 60,000 residents a year.And importantly, for the very first time, we're servicing children and adolescents. Our strategy is culturally specific, culturally competent, specific resources at the community level, because also what we heard, you know, there's still a lot of conversation around reopen the clinic.What we heard from practitioners, clinician, social workers, but also importantly, what we heard from patients, is they don\u2019t want to get their care in an institutionalized setting, and they don\u2019t want to have to travel great distances. Going from 2,500 a year to 60,000; that\u2019s a big leap forward. And as I said, for the first time, providing services for free, regardless of insurance, regardless of ability to pay, regardless of citizenship status in all of our 77 neighborhoods. That\u2019s a big deal.Chicago has more cops per capita than New York and LA, but Chicago's per capita murder rate is higher than both New York and LA. Is there any evidence that supports that increasing the police budget, which you have done in your term, and increasing the police presence effectively prevents and reduces crime?Well, I think you lose me when you try to do an apples to apples comparison between us and New York and LA. And let me tell you why. New York's circumstances are very, very different than ours are.And a big part of it is we have a lot more entrenched generational poverty than New York does.And that right away, I think, takes us into a different space, because a root cause of a lot of the issues related to violence are generational patterns. I think that\u2019s just a fact, the data is very clear on that.What I know about LA, which is probably a closer comparative to Chicago, is they have been at police reform and accountability and building trusted relationships with the community, probably 10 years ahead of us, because they wanted to have a consent decree way earlier than we did.And that's made, I think, a considerable difference. And frankly, what people in neighborhoods that have been historically plagued by violence, they don't want to cut back, there's no appetite for defunding. They tell us all the time, we want more police. Now, it\u2019s not just about throwing bodies at the problem. We\u2019ve got to make sure that they\u2019re well trained, that they understand and respect the constitutional policing practices, that they understand and respect of the community, but also layering on the other soft power tools that we\u2019re using, from street outreach to the Community Safety Coordination Center and working directly with communities to ask them what do they feel like they need, and then using our whole government approach to really move the needle in areas that have historically been crime plagued. So there\u2019s not a simple solution to the challenges of violence. If there was a simple solution, we would have implemented it a long time ago. But what we know from the data-based, data-driven strategies that we\u2019ve seen across other cities, but also here, is a multi-tiered strategy is what\u2019s helped us make pretty remarkable progress in year over year from \u201821 to \u201822\u2013Would you say the universal income program has made an impact in that way?Anything that we're doing. It's too soon for us to be able to say that yet, because the first checks went out the door in June, July of last year, but anything that we're doing to take concrete positive strides to hit that poverty is an important thing. No question. That's why Invest South/West is important.That's why we put another $300 million already into the Chicago Recovery Plan grants. All those things where we're building healthy, vibrant neighborhoods, we're stabilizing them or bringing affordable housing, we're bringing in jobs, economic development. We're in the hope business. We're about creating hope and opportunity.I asked all the other candidates this about the SAFE-T Act. I know you've been in opposition at times with Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx about crime in Chicago and who's to blame for crime in Chicago. Do you support the SAFE-T Act? Especially as we talked about arrests not being the only solution to the crime problem in Chicago.Kim Foxx and I have viewed this issue from different lenses. My biggest issue, though, is not with the state's attorney. My biggest issue is the courts that let too many violent, dangerous people back out on the street.When you are a victim of crime, and you must have the courage to identify the person that has caused you harm, and then that person is right back on the street 24 or 48 hours after they've been arrested, that tells you you're not being seen by the criminal justice system here in Cook County.That's their responsibility. So I think it frankly undermines and delegitimizes that important part of the public safety ecosystem. People have to have confidence that when they\u2019re harmed, there are consequences, or they\u2019re harmed and somebody is seeing them and feeling their pain, and doing something about it, doesn't undermine the constitutional protection for criminal defendants. They're entitled to a presumption of innocence. They\u2019re entitled to their day in court. But so too, are the victims of crime entitled to those pretrial decisions, pretrial detention decisions, also factoring in danger to the community.And that\u2019s the thing that I know now has been fixed in the SAFE-T Act. There\u2019s other things about it that I think are important. Nobody thinks that Cook County Jail or any county jail should be a debtors\u2019 prison, and for too long for poor people getting locked up because they couldn\u2019t pay the cash bail. But I\u2019m concerned, given the track record of the pretrial detention judges in Cook County, what their interpretation of the contours of the SAFE-T Act are going to be. And I\u2019m glad that the legislature in the veto session corrected and put back into the Act community safety as a factor that judges must consider [when setting bail]. Now it was in there before and unfortunately, too many judges weren\u2019t considering it. So we\u2019ve got to be fierce vocal advocates that community safety must be at the table when they\u2019re making pretrial detention decisions.People are asking for you to reopen the mental health clinics, which is something that you campaigned on in 2019. What do you think about Treatment Not Trauma? Is it something that you support? Were there some things in it that you didn\u2019t support?I won\u2019t say that I\u2019m totally conversant in every aspect of that ordinance. But I think for the most part, we\u2019re doing what the objective is, which is providing alternative ways for us to respond to people that are in mental health crisis, or people that are suffering from substance abuse, addiction issues.We set up a pilot program, now two years in, that it is. One part of it is a CIT, crisis intervention trained-police officer, accompanies the clinician. The clinician takes a lead on calls that come in through 9-1-1. \n\nThe other pilot is no CIT officer, and no officer of any kind, but really focused on substance abuse and addiction issues.\nWe\u2019re still, I think, gathering a lot of useful learning from that. It took us some time, as you might imagine, to set up the protocols for the 9-1-1 call takers, because look. Let's face it, people that are in mental health crisis, there's still a big stigma behind that. And even if the person themselves is calling, or if a family member is calling, they're reluctant to provide all the information that's necessary. So we had to make sure that we set up the right protocols and the right training for the call taker to be able to tease out the information that then could help educate the dispatcher of what resources should be dispatched to respond to this call. So that took some time. But I've met on a frequent basis. I get an update from our team. I've met directly with the people that are part of the CARE pilot programs. They\u2019re phenomenal people. I think they're super committed to their work. We're learning a lot from them and their experiences. Our goal is to try to scale this up into other areas of our city later this year.An argument that people may have is that with the program, a police officer does go out to mental health calls crises with health care workers.In one of the pilots, right. But here's the thing you need to know: What we heard resoundingly from the social workers and the clinicians, is they do not want to go out by themselves to those calls.Because, look. The truth is, you can get a lot of information from the 9-1-1 call. But the reality is, you really don't know what the circumstances are until you get there. You see the person, understand the circumstances, we try to get information about the history. A lot of that detail that's critical to figure out what is the right intervention response, you do not know until you get there. And there are concerns, and I get it, on behalf of clinicians and social workers, \u201chey, well, I don't want to go out there by myself, I don't know what I'm getting into.\u201d And if the person is violent, or it's a dangerous set of circumstances, they feel comfortable having that police backup. Again, they take the lead, and we've got EMTs that go out. But we've got to follow the lead and the people who are actually doing the work. \nIt's one thing to stand on the sidelines and dictate, \u201cwell, we think this, this and this.\u201d We're following the data, and we're following what the experts are telling us are the circumstances on the ground that will maximize the successful intervention based upon the information they're receiving.Chicago Public Schools is no longer the nation's third largest district. After 11 consecutive years of declining enrollment, CPS now sits fourth behind Miami-Dade county\u2026Now keep in mind,Miami-Dade is a whole county of almost 30 communities.But yes.Union leaders, activists and parents are urging Chicago public schools to rethink this school-based funding model that they say ultimately results in a declining enrollment and the closing of more schools. Do you support getting rid of the school-based funding model? And if so, what should be the new model? How will it improve conditions?So I think you rolled a lot of things together and said, \u201cthis is contributing to declining enrollment.\u201d And I can't necessarily agree with that. Look, there's a lot of things I think that impacted the loss of Black population in the city. And that's fundamentally really what we're talking about, because Latino population is growing, Asians are the fastest growing demographic in our city, and the white population is pretty stable. So really, what we're talking about in terms of CPS is the Black population.\u00a0Look, there's a lot of things that contributed to that. Closing almost 50 schools contributed to that. Loss of jobs and opportunity on the Southwest Side, tearing down public housing without an immediate replacement of those housing units have contributed to that. So there's a bunch of different factors that have led to the reduction in population across the Black diaspora in Chicago. And it's not all just CPS related. CPS is impacted by it quite dramatically, but there\u2019s whole lot of other factors beyond CPS\u2019 control, I think that have led to the decline of population.Would you say that the school based funding model plays a role to some degree?I think there were some fair criticisms of the school-based models. What the new CPS CEO [Pedro Martinez] and his leadership team have done, is said, \u201clook, for every school, we have to have a floor of resources that are there.\u201d We have to make sure there are arts, there are sciences, there are math, so that it's not catches catch can, if you will, depending on what school you go to. There's a floor. We just started making those kinds of mandatory investments last school year. It's still an ongoing series of investments. But I think that's where you start to get to the heart of the problem.\u00a0But also, frankly, we have to go back to Springfield and be honest and say there's not enough resources here for CPS. People think they solved the school funding problem roughly 10 years ago. Yeah, it stabilizes the district. It definitely provides more resources, but it's not enough. And we're not getting our fair share from Springfield, and we've got to continue to advocate, to fight that fight because that's absolutely true. But we also have to have honest conversations about what is the quality of education that we're getting in some of these buildings, where there's so few students? Are we being fair to them? Is there another way that we can do that?\u00a0And again, by no means am I suggesting we're gonna do massive closures, but I think we have to have an honest conversation with the students, parents, the faculty and other community stakeholders about what is the way that we revitalize and make these schools and local community schools vibrant again. How do we do that? Because I'm a big proponent of neighborhood schools and strengthening those neighborhood schools. But we got to do that in partnership with the local communities. And not a surprise to you, there's a lot of skepticism and weariness, when you even start to say, \u2018let's have that conversation,\u2019 because people jump and think, \u2018Oh, here they come again. They're gonna try to close our school.\u2019 No, but we need to have an honest conversation about what a vibrant, safe nurturing environment means on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.Part of the elected school board bill includes a moratorium on school closures and that will lift in 2025. If you're elected, should parents and school communities be concerned about more closures in 2025?I think the current leadership team at CPS has started a necessary conversation with parents, students, LSCs, building staff in those communities, about how do we make sure that every CPS student gets a high quality education. There's not a one-size-fits-all solution. And those conversations have to happen. Period.And how are you involved in those conversations? I think there's a lot of concern, especially after a lot of people witnessed the money going towards a new school being built on the South Side instead of seeing that money go into some of the existing schools.It's not an either/or. We have invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars, both in programming and the infrastructure of budgets.So I would press you to identify a place where we have given short shrift to a school that needed it. What I've seen over the arc of my tenure is a recommitment to making those vital investments from a programmatic side, from a infrastructure side to make sure that buildings themselves are up to where we want the kind of places that we want kids to be able to live and learn in. So it's not an either/or.And as the CEO and his leadership team have been talking about, we have been making investments based upon what the data tells us with our parents, our LSCs and our teachers tell us, and just because there was an investment made in one place, doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not making investments in other places, and we are. And you don\u2019t have to take my word for it. You\u2019re gonna see it. It\u2019s happening right now.So there\u2019s a lot of concern, as I said, that, \u201coh, if we\u2019re going to the South Loop, then that means nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d That\u2019s absolutely not true. And by the way, most of the kids that are going to that South Loop high school are kids of color. They\u2019re Black kids. They\u2019re brown kids. They\u2019re Asian kids.And then I\u2019ll bring it to the Invest South/West Initiative. Historically, we\u2019ve watched big developments displace and erase black communities in Chicago. And right now in Austin, for example, your Invest South/West plan is renovating the former Laramie Bank, turning it into a mixed use building with adjacent land that will also be redeveloped into a mixed income multistory rental building.\u00a0\u00a0How would you implement that project in Austin, for example, while also ensuring that the new developments won't advance gentrification and push Black residents out? That's something that we're seeing already happen in an area of that Obama library. People are worried about it happening in Cabrini Green, which is already being called the \u201cnear North Side\u201d now. So people in Austin are just worried that new development means, at some point, we\u2019ll be priced out. I will say a couple things to that. Every single one of our vertical construction projects that\u2019s a part of Invest South/West has gone through a very rigorous community engagement process, where the community has identified what they wanted to see, the locations and the contours of what that development should look like. So the community is very much front and center at the table from the very beginning of any of the vertical construction in Invest South/West. I think fundamentally, that's a big part of what you do. \n\nYou mentioned the concerns about gentrification and displacement in light of the Obama Center on the South Side. We've been very engaged in Woodlawn and South Shore from the very beginning of my administration. When the very first public meetings that I had, after being sworn in as mayor, was about the Obama Center, down in the South Shore Country Club with a group of probably 30 to 40 stakeholders who had been at it for a time and were concerned about the very issue that you raised, which is gentrification, and displacement.So we put some controls in place to make sure that long-term homeowners could stay in their home, that rents would still be affordable down in that area. We work with a lot of stakeholders in Woodlawn, in South Shore; we work with the local level elected officials. So I think we have a model that we are now transporting to other parts of the city. And the West Side clearly is one of them. \n\nNow, the West Side started to see housing prices rise, frankly, before I took office, but Invest South/West is about frankly, bringing more affordable units to the West Side that currently do not exist.\nIn 2019 you campaigned as a progressive candidate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, you stood in Garfield Park and had the press conference where you said we \u201cwill shut you down, we will cite you, and if have to, we will arrest you.\u201d During the 2020 uprisings, you raised the bridges and voiced opposition to Defund CPD. Those things are perceived as being the furthest away from being progressive.\u00a0\u00a0If you\u2019re reelected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them this time around?They hold me accountable every single day. When you're the mayor, you're on the frontlines, and Chicagoans aren\u2019t shy about expressing their opinions. And they're certainly not shy about expressing complaints.\u00a0Look, I press you to find a more progressive mayor than I\u2019ve been. Yeah, in an emergency I did what was necessary to make sure that we kept Chicagoans safe. And let's go back to the summer of 2022. When I watched on camera, massive crowds that came downtown that were lighting buildings on fire, that were overturning vehicles. There was a CTA bus that a crowd tried to flip with people in it. Ambulances, police cars, it was mayhem. And yeah, we did what was necessary at the behest of residents, businesses, to keep our community safe. I make no apologies for those. That absolutely was necessary and to save lives. Absolutely.\u00a0We had too many instances during COVID where people were ignoring the public health advice. What we knew in those early days was not much about COVID, but we knew two things: that it spread like wildfire, and that it was potentially deadly. And who died? Who was most negatively impacted by COVID? Black Chicago.\u00a0So if you look at those nuggets that you pulled out, but you juxtapose them against a whole record \u2014 historic investments in affordable housing, never been done before in our city; historic investments in mental health, never been done before in our city; historic investments in homelessness, never been done in our city. Restitching the social safety net in a way that we have, being smart and using our dollars to make sure that we're making lasting impacts not just for a minute, but for a lifetime. You're not going to find anybody who's been more progressive than I am. People can talk a good game, but I've delivered and I will continue to deliver over and over again."

The space was most recently leased by Bank of America.\u00a0According to the letter, the coalition will demonstrate \u201chow $25 million from the recent sale of this building could have been used to create nearly 200 units of affordable housing with supportive services for persons experiencing homelessness.\u201d\n         During her 2023 budget address, Mayor Lightfoot proposed $200 million in investments for the homeless. However, housing advocates say a one-time payment isn\u2019t enough to solve the problem.According to the Wall Street Journal, in December 2021, Oak Hill Advisors agreed to buy the building from Howard Hughes Corporation in a deal valued at $1 billion. Crain\u2019s Chicago Business reported that the sale was one of the largest transactions for a Chicago office building since the Blackstone Group purchased Willis Tower in 2015.Since 2019, organizers and stakeholders with the BCH coalition have been proposing that the city have a designated fund to combat homelessness, one that is not subject to budget fluctuations or priority shifts with changing administrations. This type of fund would develop more affordable housing and wraparound services for people who are experiencing homelessness.\u00a0\u201cFor over three years, we have tried to work with you on a proposal to increase the real estate transfer tax on high-end property sales, creating a new, dedicated revenue for over 65,000 Chicagoans living on the streets, in shelters and doubled-up,\u201d the letter reads.In addition to signing the letter and joining the demonstration on Nov. 3, the BCH coalition are calling on Chicago residents to contact their alderperson and the mayor\u2019s office to support the BCH proposal, which they believe can combat homelessness.\u201cThe Bring Chicago Home coalition remains willing and ready to work with you\u2013\u2013but will you ever be willing and ready to work with us,\u201d the letter reads.\u00a0"

  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot",
  "text": "La versi\u00f3n de Lori Lightfoot del 2019 hizo muchas promesas en la campa\u00f1a electoral. Ella le dijo a The TRiiBE que detendr\u00eda la academia de polic\u00eda, y agreg\u00f3 que su mayor problema era que el entonces alcalde Rahm Emanuel no se comprometi\u00f3 con la comunidad circundante al respecto. Ella invoc\u00f3 el esp\u00edritu de Harold Washington en su toma de posesi\u00f3n, prometiendo \u201ccalles seguras y escuelas s\u00f3lidas para todos les ni\u00f1es, sin importar el vecindario o el c\u00f3digo postal\u201d. Hab\u00eda convencido a muchos votantes de que ella era la alcaldesa progresista que Chicago necesitaba despu\u00e9s de ocho a\u00f1os de Emanuel.Sin embargo, los organizadores Negros y Latine nos advirtieron.\u00a0Poco despu\u00e9s de su toma de posesi\u00f3n, la alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot cambi\u00f3 r\u00e1pidamente de tono. En julio del 2019, anunci\u00f3 que el precio de 95 millones de d\u00f3lares de la impopular nueva academia de polic\u00edas aumentar\u00eda a un n\u00famero no especificado. Partidaria de una junta escolar electa en la campa\u00f1a electoral, se opuso al plan, que el gobernador Pritzker firm\u00f3 a pesar de sus objeciones en el 2021.Desde el principio, Lightfoot ha peleado con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago (CTU) por todo, desde su contrato hasta las medidas de seguridad de COVID-19. Cinco meses despu\u00e9s de que asumiera el cargo, el sindicato se declar\u00f3 en huelga durante dos semanas para exigir mejores salarios y m\u00e1s enfermeras y bibliotecarios. Los senadores Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) y Bernie Sanders (I-VT) se unieron a los maestros, quienes ganaron muchas de sus demandas. El alcalde ha tenido una relaci\u00f3n fr\u00eda con el sindicato desde entonces.En el 2020, se par\u00f3 en un vecindario de West Garfield Park y amenaz\u00f3 con \u201ctratarlos como a unos criminales\u201d por reunirse durante la pandemia. Ese mismo a\u00f1o cerr\u00f3 la CTA, levant\u00f3 puentes para sellar el Loop, el centro, y pele\u00f3 p\u00fablicamente con la fiscal estatal Kim Foxx por no acusar a m\u00e1s personas durante los levantamientos y protestas que estaban involucradas personas Negras.\u00a0\u201cEn una emergencia, hice lo que fue necesario para asegurarnos de mantener seguros a los habitantes de Chicago\u201d, dijo Lightfoot a The TRiiBE. \u201cNo me disculpo por eso. Eso era absolutamente necesario y era para salvar vidas\u201d.El 12 de enero, Lightfoot invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a CS Insurance Strategies en el centro de la ciudad para nuestra serie de candidatos Negros a la alcald\u00eda. La noche anterior, se supo que su campa\u00f1a solicitaba voluntarios a trav\u00e9s de correos electr\u00f3nicos de CPS. Nos reunimos con Lightfoot aproximadamente una hora antes de su conferencia de prensa de las 3:00 pm. Inicialmente, ten\u00edamos previsto reunirnos con Lightfoot el 4 de enero, pero se reprogram\u00f3 debido al viaje de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris a Chicago.Durante nuestra entrevista, Lightfoot enfatiz\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n en el alcance de la calles para la reducci\u00f3n de la violencia, promovi\u00f3 Invest South/West, Invertir en el Sur/Oeste, y duplic\u00f3 su programa piloto de Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement (CARE), una alternativa a Tratamiento, No Trauma, que env\u00eda a un consejero de salud mental junto con un oficial de polic\u00eda a llamadas de salud mental al 9-1-1. Una expansi\u00f3n del programa piloto de CARE no incluye un oficial; solo un param\u00e9dico comunitario del Departamento de Bomberos de Chicago y un m\u00e9dico de salud mental del Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica de Chicago.Cuando se trata de vigilancia, dijo que las personas en vecindarios plagados de violencia no quieren desembolsar al CPD. En cambio, dijo, quieren m\u00e1s polic\u00edas. Agreg\u00f3 que la ciudad debe asegurarse de que los oficiales est\u00e9n bien capacitados y respeten las pr\u00e1cticas policiales constitucionales.\u00a0\u201cMira, te presiono para que encuentres un alcalde m\u00e1s progresista de lo que he sido\u201d, dijo Lightfoot.Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Lightfoot como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: S\u00e9 que tiene que terminar la entrevista a una cierta hora y que tiene muchas cosas que hacer hoy. Ser\u00eda negligente si no preguntara sobre la situaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1 pasando con los correos electr\u00f3nicos de CPS en este momento. S\u00e9 que tiene una conferencia de prensa hoy a las tres en punto. Pero si podr\u00eda responder nuestras preguntas\u2026Alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot: Por supuesto. D\u00e9jame exponerlo para ti. Ayer por la tarde, me enter\u00e9 de que en un esfuerzo por reclutar j\u00f3venes para la campa\u00f1a que hemos estado (hay mucho entusiasmo y apoyo entre los j\u00f3venes de toda la ciudad), un miembro del personal de la campa\u00f1a accedi\u00f3 a las direcciones de correo electr\u00f3nico disponibles p\u00fablicamente para los maestros de CPS, les envi\u00f3 en esencia, publicando sobre las oportunidades de pasant\u00edas y les ped\u00ed que las enviaran a cualquier estudiante que pudiera estar interesado. Obviamente, eso fue un error. Hemos erigido desde el primer d\u00eda no solo una l\u00ednea, sino un muro entre la campa\u00f1a, el lado pol\u00edtico, cualquier lado oficial. Esta joven entiende la magnitud del problema que ahora se ha creado. Creo que est\u00e1 terriblemente mortificada de que haya sucedido. Le expliqu\u00e9 personalmente por qu\u00e9 esto no pod\u00eda suceder, cu\u00e1les eran las implicaciones. Creo que ella lo entiende. Hemos reiterado nuestros est\u00e1ndares de \u00e9tica y por qu\u00e9 ese muro es importante para todo el personal, nuevamente hoy, para ella ayer, obviamente, pero nuevamente para todo el personal hoy. Y como dije, fue un error, no deber\u00eda haber sucedido, y estoy segura de que no volver\u00e1 a suceder.La primera vez que me enter\u00e9 fue ayer [ Nota del editor: 11 de enero, cuando WTTW public\u00f3 la historia ]. No soy solo una candidata. Soy la alcaldesa y no estoy tan urgida de voluntarios a ese nivel. Obviamente s\u00e9 que hay un esfuerzo por generar voluntarios. Pero, \u00bfconozco los detalles? \u00bfTengo mano metida en todo? No absolutamente no.Si otro candidato a alcalde se acercara a los maestros de CPS, para voluntarios de campa\u00f1a de esta manera, \u00bfc\u00f3mo responder\u00eda a tal acci\u00f3n?Tendr\u00eda la misma reacci\u00f3n. Pero es diferente para m\u00ed, soy el alcalde, \u00bfno? El sistema escolar depende de m\u00ed. Realmente no puedo dar cuenta de lo que pueden hacer otros candidatos. Soy el alcalde y la l\u00ednea tiene que ser muy, muy clara, aplicada con rigidez y ejecutada con fidelidad. Como dije, fue un error que no deber\u00eda haber ocurrido. Lo estamos poseyendo. Y seguiremos adelante a partir de aqu\u00ed y haremos todo lo que podamos para incorporar no solo la conversaci\u00f3n sino tambi\u00e9n lo necesario para asegurarnos de que algo as\u00ed no vuelva a suceder.En su plan de seguridad, lo primero que enumera es que su administraci\u00f3n ha aumentado los fondos para enfoques comunitarios para la reducci\u00f3n de la violencia en un 1,400%, con un enfoque en las personas violentas de alto riesgo y el apoyo a las v\u00edctimas de la violencia. \u00bfCu\u00e1nto financiamiento se ha destinado exactamente a esos enfoques comunitarios? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 organizaciones o personas est\u00e1n recibiendo esta financiaci\u00f3n?No puedo decirles las organizaciones espec\u00edficas porque eso no es algo que, desear\u00eda, fueran RFP. Mucho de este dinero es federal. Pero esto es lo que puedo decirte. N\u00famero uno, sabemos que lo importante es usar todas las herramientas de nuestro conjunto de herramientas para hacer que las comunidades sean seguras. Obviamente, la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley juega un papel y se asegura de que participen en la vigilancia constitucional. Pero tenemos que perseguir a otras personas que trafican con armas ilegales, porque ese es el mayor impulsor de nuestra violencia. Y cuando vemos personas que est\u00e1n involucradas en el comercio ilegal de armas, tenemos que responsabilizar a esas personas. Porque cada arma ilegal en nuestra ciudad tiene el potencial de destruir muchas, muchas vidas para siempre, \u00bfverdad? As\u00ed que ese es un gran, gran enfoque, trabajar con nuestros socios federales, asegur\u00e1ndonos de que estamos siendo proactivos en esas investigaciones para detener a los violentos.Pero tambi\u00e9n sabemos que no podemos simplemente arrestar a criminales y salir de este problema. Tenemos que invertir para salir del problema. Y lo que eso significa es que tenemos que considerar el uso de herramientas de potencia suave. As\u00ed que hemos hecho inversiones bastante hist\u00f3ricas en el alcance de las calles. Y hay una serie de organizaciones de divulgaci\u00f3n callejera en toda la ciudad que financiamos. Hemos aumentado esa financiaci\u00f3n desde que comenc\u00e9 en el cargo hasta, como, alrededor de $ 1 mill\u00f3n o $ 2 millones al a\u00f1o que la ciudad estaba financiando. Ahora estamos, creo, y les daremos n\u00fameros precisos, pero creo que son alrededor de $58 millones sobre una base anual.Es una combinaci\u00f3n de algunos d\u00f3lares ARPA, es algo de dinero del cannabis que obtenemos y hemos emitido varios bonos para pagar algunas de las inversiones que hemos realizado. Tambi\u00e9n hemos apoyado organizaciones comunitarias.Estamos tratando de reconstruir y revitalizar la estructura del club de cuadras. Enfocamos las inversiones en lotes bald\u00edos, porque ese es otro gran impulsor, la salud mental. A veces la gente no piensa en eso como una herramienta para reducir la violencia. Yo creo que lo es. Y desde fines del a\u00f1o pasado, ahora contamos con servicios de salud mental gratuitos y culturalmente relevantes. En cada uno de nuestros 77 vecindarios, eso es un aumento de siete veces. Fuimos desde donde comenc\u00e9, donde la ciudad prestaba servicios a unos 2500 residentes al a\u00f1o. Terminamos el a\u00f1o pasado dando servicio a unos 60,000 residentes al a\u00f1o. Y lo m\u00e1s importante, por primera vez, estamos atendiendo a ni\u00f1es y adolescentes. Nuestra estrategia es culturalmente espec\u00edfica, culturalmente competente, recursos espec\u00edficos a nivel comunitario, porque tambi\u00e9n escuchamos, ya sabes, todav\u00eda hay mucha conversaci\u00f3n sobre la reapertura de la cl\u00ednica.Lo que escuchamos de los m\u00e9dicos, trabajadores sociales, pero tambi\u00e9n lo que es importante, lo que escuchamos de los pacientes, es que no quieren recibir atenci\u00f3n en un entorno institucionalizado y no quieren tener que viajar grandes distancias. Pasando de 2,500 al a\u00f1o a 60,000, eso es un gran salto hac\u00eda adelante. Y como dije, por primera vez, estamos brindando servicios de forma gratuita, independientemente del seguro, independientemente de la capacidad de pago, independientemente del estado de ciudadan\u00eda en todos nuestros 77 vecindarios. Esa es un gran logro.Chicago tiene m\u00e1s polic\u00edas per c\u00e1pita que Nueva York y Los \u00c1ngeles, pero la tasa de homicidios per c\u00e1pita de Chicago es m\u00e1s alta que la de Nueva York y Los \u00c1ngeles. \u00bfHay alguna evidencia que respalde que aumentar el presupuesto policial, como lo ha hecho en su mandato, y aumentar la presencia policial efectivamente previene y reduce el crimen?Bueno, creo que me pierdes cuando tratas de hacer una comparaci\u00f3n de manzanas con manzanas entre nosotros, Nueva York y Los \u00c1ngeles. Y dejame decirte por qu\u00e9. Las circunstancias de Nueva York son muy, muy diferentes a las nuestras. Y una gran parte de esto es que tenemos mucha m\u00e1s pobreza generacional arraigada que Nueva York. Y eso de inmediato, creo, nos lleva a un espacio diferente, porque una causa fundamental de muchos de los problemas relacionados con la violencia son los patrones generacionales. Creo que eso es solo un hecho, los datos son muy claros al respecto.Lo que s\u00e9 sobre Los \u00c1ngeles, que es probablemente una comparaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana a Chicago, es que han estado en la reforma policial y la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas y en la construcci\u00f3n de relaciones de confianza con la comunidad, probablemente 10 a\u00f1os antes que nosotros, porque quer\u00edan tener un decreto de consentimiento mucho antes. Lo hicimos, y eso ha hecho, creo, una diferencia considerable. Y, francamente, lo que la gente de los barrios que hist\u00f3ricamente ha estado plagado de violencia no quiere recortar, no tienen ganas de quitar el presupuesto a la policia. Nos dicen todo el tiempo, queremos m\u00e1s polic\u00edas.Ahora bien, no se trata solo de arrojar cad\u00e1veres al problema. Tenemos que asegurarnos de que est\u00e9n bien capacitados, que entiendan y respeten las pr\u00e1cticas policiales constitucionales, que entiendan y respeten a la comunidad, pero tambi\u00e9n superponiendo las otras herramientas de poder blando que estamos usando, desde la calle llegar al Centro de Coordinaci\u00f3n de Seguridad Comunitaria y trabajar directamente con las comunidades para preguntarles qu\u00e9 sienten que necesitan, y luego usar todo nuestro enfoque gubernamental para realmente mover la aguja en \u00e1reas que hist\u00f3ricamente han estado plagadas de delitos. As\u00ed que no hay una soluci\u00f3n simple a los desaf\u00edos de la violencia. Si hubiera una soluci\u00f3n simple, la habr\u00edamos implementado hace mucho tiempo. Pero lo que sabemos de las estrategias basadas en datos que hemos visto en otras ciudades, pero tambi\u00e9n aqu\u00ed.\u00bfDir\u00eda que el programa de ingreso universal ha tenido un impacto de esa manera?Cualquier cosa que estemos haciendo. Todav\u00eda es demasiado pronto para que podamos decir eso, porque los primeros cheques salieron por la puerta en junio, julio del a\u00f1o pasado, pero cualquier cosa que estemos haciendo para dar pasos positivos concretos para combatir la pobreza es algo importante. No hay duda. Es por eso que Invest South/West, Invertir en Sur/Oeste, es importante. Es por eso que ya invertimos otros $300 millones en las subvenciones del Plan de Recuperaci\u00f3n de Chicago. Todas esas cosas en las que estamos construyendo vecindarios saludables y vibrantes, los estamos estabilizando o trayendo viviendas asequibles, estamos trayendo empleos, desarrollo econ\u00f3mico. Estamos en el negocio de la esperanza. Estamos a punto de crear esperanza y oportunidad.Les pregunt\u00e9 a todos los dem\u00e1s candidatos sobre la Ley SAFE-T. S\u00e9 que en ocasiones ha estado en oposici\u00f3n con la fiscal estatal del condado de Cook, Kim Foxx, sobre el crimen en Chicago y qui\u00e9n tiene la culpa del crimen en Chicago. \u00bfApoya la Ley SAFE-T? Especialmente cuando hablamos de que los arrestos no son la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n al problema de la delincuencia en Chicago.Kim Foxx y yo hemos visto este tema desde diferentes perspectivas. Sin embargo, mi mayor problema no es con el fiscal del estado. Mi mayor problema son los tribunales que permiten que demasiadas personas violentas y peligrosas vuelvan a la calle. Cuando eres v\u00edctima de un delito, y debes tener el coraje de identificar a la persona que te ha hecho da\u00f1o, y luego esa persona vuelve a la calle 24 o 48 horas despu\u00e9s de haber sido arrestada, eso te dice a ti, no estamos siendo vistos por el sistema de justicia penal aqu\u00ed en el condado de Cook. Esa es su responsabilidad. As\u00ed que creo que francamente deslegitima esa parte importante del ecosistema de seguridad p\u00fablica. Las personas deben tener la confianza de que cuando son lastimadas, hay consecuencias, o son lastimadas y alguien las est\u00e1 viendo y sintiendo su dolor, y haciendo algo al respecto, no se ignora la protecci\u00f3n constitucional para los acusados \u200b\u200bpenales. Tienen derecho a la presunci\u00f3n de inocencia. Tienen derecho a su d\u00eda en la corte. Pero tambi\u00e9n las v\u00edctimas del delito tienen derecho a esas decisiones previas al juicio, decisiones de prisi\u00f3n preventiva, que tambi\u00e9n representan un peligro para la comunidad.Y eso es lo que ahora s\u00e9 que se ha solucionado en la Ley SAFE-T. Hay otras cosas al respecto que creo que son importantes. Nadie piensa que la C\u00e1rcel del Condado de Cook o cualquier c\u00e1rcel del condado deba ser una prisi\u00f3n para deudores, y durante demasiado tiempo para que la gente pobre sea encarcelada porque no pudo pagar la fianza en efectivo. Pero me preocupa, dado el historial de los jueces de detenci\u00f3n preventiva en el condado de Cook, cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su interpretaci\u00f3n de los contornos de la Ley SAFE-T. Y me alegra que la legislatura en la sesi\u00f3n de veto corrigiera y volviera a incluir en la ley la seguridad de la comunidad como un factor que los jueces deben considerar [al establecer la fianza]. Ahora estuvo all\u00ed antes y, desafortunadamente, demasiados jueces no lo consideraron. As\u00ed que tenemos que ser fervientes defensores vocales de que la seguridad de la comunidad debe estar en la mesa cuando toman decisiones de prisi\u00f3n preventiva.La gente le pide que vuelva a abrir las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental, que es algo por lo que hizo su campa\u00f1a en el 2019. \u00bfQu\u00e9 piensa sobre Tratamiento, No Trauma? \u00bfEs algo que apoya? \u00bfHubo algunas cosas que no apoy\u00f3?No dir\u00e9 que estoy totalmente versada en todos los aspectos de esa ordenanza. Pero creo que en su mayor parte, estamos haciendo lo que es el objetivo, que es proporcionar formas alternativas para que podamos responder a las personas que est\u00e1n en crisis de salud mental, o personas que sufren de abuso de sustancias y problemas de adicci\u00f3n.Establecimos un programa piloto, ahora dos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, eso es. Una parte de ella es un CIT, oficial de polic\u00eda capacitado en intervenci\u00f3n de crisis, que acompa\u00f1a al m\u00e9dico. El m\u00e9dico toma la delantera en las llamadas que entran a trav\u00e9s del 9-1-1.El otro programa piloto no es un oficial de CIT ni un oficial de ning\u00fan tipo, pero realmente se enfoca en problemas de abuso de sustancias y adicciones. Todav\u00eda estamos, creo, reuniendo mucho aprendizaje \u00fatil de ese programa. Nos tom\u00f3 alg\u00fan tiempo, como se puede imaginar, configurar los protocolos para los que toman las llamadas al 9-1-1, porque mira, seamos realistas, las personas que est\u00e1n en crisis de salud mental, todav\u00eda hay un gran estigma detr\u00e1s de eso. E incluso, si la persona misma llama, o si llama un miembro de la familia, no siempre quieren proporcionar toda la informaci\u00f3n necesaria. Por lo tanto, ten\u00edamos que asegurarnos de establecer los protocolos correctos y la capacitaci\u00f3n adecuada para que la persona que atiende la llamada pudiera obtener la informaci\u00f3n que luego podr\u00eda ayudar a educar al despachador sobre qu\u00e9 recursos se deben enviar para responder a esta llamada. Entonces eso tom\u00f3 algo de tiempo. Pero me he reunido con el equipo que son parte del programa piloto CARE con frecuencia, y son gente fenomenal. Creo que est\u00e1n s\u00faper comprometidos con su trabajo. Estamos aprendiendo mucho de ellos y de sus experiencias. Nuestro objetivo es tratar de ampliar esto a otras \u00e1reas de nuestra ciudad a finales de este a\u00f1o.Un argumento que la gente puede tener es que con el programa, un oficial de polic\u00eda sale a las llamadas de crisis de salud mental con los trabajadores de la salud.En uno de los programas pilotos, verdad. Pero esto es lo que usted necesita saber: lo que escuchamos rotundamente de los trabajadores sociales y los m\u00e9dicos es que no quieren salir solos a esas llamadas. Porque, mira, la verdad es que puede obtener mucha informaci\u00f3n de la llamada al 9-1-1. Pero la realidad es que realmente no sabes cu\u00e1les son las circunstancias hasta que llegas all\u00ed. Ves a la persona, entiendes las circunstancias, tratamos de obtener informaci\u00f3n sobre la historia. Muchos de esos detalles que son cr\u00edticos para descubrir cu\u00e1l es la respuesta de intervenci\u00f3n correcta, no se saben hasta que se llega all\u00ed. Y hay preocupaciones, y lo entiendo, en nombre de los m\u00e9dicos y trabajadores sociales, \"oye, bueno, no quiero salir solo, no s\u00e9 en qu\u00e9 me estoy metiendo\". Y si la persona es violenta, o se trata de un conjunto de circunstancias peligrosas, se sienten c\u00f3modos con el apoyo de la polic\u00eda. Una vez m\u00e1s, toman la iniciativa y tenemos t\u00e9cnicos de emergencias m\u00e9dicas que salen. Pero tenemos que seguir el ejemplo y las personas que realmente est\u00e1n haciendo el trabajo.Una cosa es quedarse al margen y dictar, \"bueno, pensamos esto, esto y esto\". Estamos siguiendo los datos, y estamos siguiendo lo que los expertos nos dicen que son las circunstancias sobre el terreno que maximizar\u00e1n la intervenci\u00f3n exitosa en funci\u00f3n de la informaci\u00f3n que est\u00e1n recibiendo.Las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago ya no son el tercer distrito m\u00e1s grande del pa\u00eds. Despu\u00e9s de 11 a\u00f1os consecutivos con bajas de inscripci\u00f3n, CPS ahora ocupa el cuarto lugar detr\u00e1s del condado de Miami-Dade...Ahora tenga en cuenta que Miami-Dade es un condado completo de casi 30 comunidades. Pero si.Los l\u00edderes sindicales, los activistas y los padres est\u00e1n urgiendo a las escuelas p\u00fablicas de Chicago a repensar este modelo de financiaci\u00f3n basado en las escuelas que, seg\u00fan dicen, en \u00faltima instancia resulta en una disminuci\u00f3n de la inscripci\u00f3n y el cierre de m\u00e1s escuelas. \u00bfApoya deshacerse del modelo de financiaci\u00f3n basado en la escuela? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfcu\u00e1l deber\u00eda ser el nuevo modelo? \u00bfC\u00f3mo mejorar\u00e1 las condiciones?Creo que juntaste muchas cosas para decir: \"esto est\u00e1 contribuyendo a la disminuci\u00f3n de la inscripci\u00f3n\". Y no puedo estar necesariamente de acuerdo con eso. Mira, creo que hay muchas cosas que afectaron la p\u00e9rdida de poblaci\u00f3n Negra en la ciudad. Y eso es fundamentalmente de lo que estamos hablando, porque la poblaci\u00f3n Latine est\u00e1 creciendo, los asi\u00e1ticos son el grupo demogr\u00e1fico de m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido crecimiento en nuestra ciudad y la poblaci\u00f3n blanca es bastante estable. Realmente, de lo que estamos hablando en t\u00e9rminos de CPS es de la poblaci\u00f3n Negra.\u00a0Mira, hay muchas cosas que contribuyeron a eso. El cierre de casi 50 escuelas contribuy\u00f3 a eso. La p\u00e9rdida de empleos y oportunidades en el lado suroeste, el derribo de viviendas p\u00fablicas sin un reemplazo inmediato de esas unidades de vivienda ha contribuido a eso. Entonces, hay un mont\u00f3n de factores diferentes que han llevado a la reducci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n en la di\u00e1spora Negra en Chicago. Y no todo est\u00e1 relacionado con CPS. CPS se ve afectado por esto de manera bastante dram\u00e1tica, pero hay muchos otros factores m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del control de CPS, que creo que han llevado a la disminuci\u00f3n de la poblaci\u00f3n.\u00bfDir\u00eda que el modelo de financiamiento basado en la escuela juega un papel hasta cierto punto?Creo que hubo algunas cr\u00edticas justas a los modelos basados \u200b\u200ben la escuela. Lo que han dicho el nuevo director ejecutivo de CPS [Pedro Mart\u00ednez] y su equipo de liderazgo es, \u201cmira, para cada escuela, tenemos que tener un piso de recursos que est\u00e9n ah\u00ed\u201d. Tenemos que asegurarnos de que haya artes, hay ciencias, hay matem\u00e1ticas, dependiendo de la escuela a la que vayas, que hayan recursos. Empezamos a hacer ese tipo de inversiones obligatorias el a\u00f1o pasado. Todav\u00eda es una serie continua de inversiones. Pero creo que ah\u00ed es donde empiezas a llegar al coraz\u00f3n del problema.\u00a0Pero tambi\u00e9n, francamente, tenemos que volver a Springfield y ser honestos y decir que aqu\u00ed no hay suficientes recursos para CPS. La gente piensa que resolvieron el problema de la financiaci\u00f3n escolar hace aproximadamente 10 a\u00f1os. S\u00ed, estabiliza el distrito. Definitivamente proporciona m\u00e1s recursos, pero no es suficiente. Y no estamos recibiendo nuestra parte justa de Springfield, y tenemos que seguir defendiendo, peleando esa lucha porque eso es absolutamente cierto. Pero tambi\u00e9n tenemos que tener conversaciones honestas sobre cu\u00e1l es la calidad de la educaci\u00f3n que estamos recibiendo en algunos de estos edificios, donde hay tan pocos estudiantes. \u00bfEstamos siendo justos con ellos? \u00bfHay otra manera de que podamos hacer eso?\u00a0Y nuevamente, de ninguna manera estoy sugiriendo que vamos a hacer cierres masivos, pero creo que debemos tener una conversaci\u00f3n honesta con los estudiantes, los padres, la facultad y otras partes interesadas de la comunidad sobre cu\u00e1l es la forma en que revitalizamos y hagamos que las escuelas comunitarias locales vibren de nuevo. \u00bfComo hacemos eso? Porque soy un gran defensora de las escuelas de vecindario y del fortalecimiento de esas escuelas de vecindario? Pero tenemos que hacerlo en asociaci\u00f3n con las comunidades locales. Y no es una sorpresa para ti, hay mucho escepticismo y cansancio, cuando incluso empiezas a decir, 'vamos a tener esa conversaci\u00f3n', porque la gente salta y piensa, 'Oh, aqu\u00ed vienen de nuevo. Van a intentar cerrar nuestra escuela. No, pero necesitamos tener una conversaci\u00f3n honesta sobre lo que significa tener un entorno vibrante, nutriente, y eso cambia depende cada vecindario.Parte del proyecto de ley de la junta escolar electa incluye una moratoria sobre el cierre de escuelas y eso se levantar\u00e1 en el 2025. Si es elegida, \u00bfdeber\u00edan los padres y las comunidades escolares preocuparse por m\u00e1s cierres en el 2025?Creo que el equipo de liderazgo actual de CPS ha iniciado una conversaci\u00f3n necesaria con los padres, los estudiantes, los LSC y el personal de construcci\u00f3n en esas comunidades, sobre c\u00f3mo nos aseguramos de que todos los estudiantes de CPS reciban una educaci\u00f3n de alta calidad. No hay una soluci\u00f3n \u00fanica para todos. Y esas conversaciones tienen que suceder. Punto.\u00bfY c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 involucrada en esas conversaciones? Creo que hay mucha preocupaci\u00f3n, especialmente despu\u00e9s de que muchas personas presenciaron que el dinero se destinaba a la construcci\u00f3n de una nueva escuela en el lado sur en lugar de ver que el dinero se destinaba a algunas de las escuelas existentes.No es un uno u otro. Hemos invertido literalmente cientos de millones de d\u00f3lares, tanto en programaci\u00f3n como en infraestructura de presupuestos. As\u00ed que los presionar\u00eda para que identifiquen un lugar donde le hemos dado poca atenci\u00f3n a una escuela que la necesitaba. Lo que he visto durante el arco de mi mandato es un nuevo compromiso de hacer esas inversiones vitales desde un lado program\u00e1tico, desde un lado de infraestructura para asegurar que los edificios mismos est\u00e9n a la altura de lo que queremos como tipos de lugares les ni\u00f1es tengan la capacidad de vivir y aprender. As\u00ed que no es tema de uno o del otro.Y como el CEO y su equipo de liderazgo han estado hablando, hemos estado haciendo inversiones basadas en lo que nos dicen los datos con nuestros padres, nuestros LSC y nuestros maestros, y solo porque hubo una inversi\u00f3n hecha en un lugar, no significa que no estemos haciendo inversiones en otros lugares, y lo estamos haciendo. Y no tienes que creer en mi palabra. Lo vas a ver que est\u00e1 sucediendo ahora mismo.Entonces, hay mucha preocupaci\u00f3n, como dije, de que, \"oh, si vamos al South Loop, eso significa que no va a pasar nada\". Eso no es absolutamente cierto. Y, por cierto, la mayor\u00eda de les ni\u00f1es que van a esa escuela secundaria de South Loop son ni\u00f1es de color. Son ni\u00f1es Negros. Son ni\u00f1es Latine. Son ni\u00f1es asi\u00e1ticos.Ahora voy a preguntarle acerca de la Iniciativa Invest South/West, Invertir en el Sur/Oeste. Hist\u00f3ricamente, hemos visto grandes desarrollos que han desplazado y borrado comunidades Negras en Chicago. Y en este momento en Austin, por ejemplo, su plan Invest South/West est\u00e1 renovando el antiguo Laramie Bank, convirti\u00e9ndolo en un edificio de uso mixto con terrenos adyacentes que tambi\u00e9n se volver\u00e1n a desarrollar en un edificio de alquiler de varios pisos para ingresos mixtos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00bfC\u00f3mo implementar\u00e1 ese proyecto en Austin, por ejemplo, al mismo tiempo que se asegurara de que los nuevos desarrollos no promuevan la gentrificaci\u00f3n y expulsen a los residentes Negros? Eso es algo que ya estamos viendo suceder en el \u00e1rea donde esta localizada la biblioteca de Obama. A la gente le preocupa que esto suceda como lo que paso en Cabrini Green, que ahora ya se llama el \"Near North Side\". As\u00ed que la gente en Austin est\u00e1 preocupada de que el nuevo desarrollo signifique que, en alg\u00fan momento, se nos va a salir del precio el poder vivir en Austin.Dir\u00e9 un par de cosas a eso. Cada uno de nuestros proyectos de construcci\u00f3n vertical que forma parte de Invest South/West, Invertir en el Sur/Oeste, ha pasado por un proceso de participaci\u00f3n comunitaria muy riguroso, donde la comunidad ha identificado lo que quer\u00eda ver, las ubicaciones y los contornos de c\u00f3mo deber\u00eda ser ese desarrollo. Por lo tanto, la comunidad est\u00e1 muy al frente y en el centro de la mesa desde el comienzo de cualquiera de las construcciones verticales en Invest South/West, Invertir en el Sur/Oeste. Creo que fundamentalmente, eso es una gran parte de lo que haces.Usted mencion\u00f3 las preocupaciones sobre la gentrificaci\u00f3n y el desplazamiento a la luz del centro Obama en el lado sur. Hemos estado muy comprometidos con Woodlawn y South Shore desde el comienzo de mi administraci\u00f3n. Cuando las primeras reuniones p\u00fablicas que tuve, despu\u00e9s de prestar juramento como alcalde, fueron sobre el Obama Center, en el South Shore Country Club con un grupo de probablemente 30 a 40 partes interesadas que hab\u00edan estado en eso durante un tiempo y estaban preocupados sobre el mismo tema que planteaste, que es la gentrificaci\u00f3n y el desplazamiento. Por lo tanto, implementamos algunos controles para asegurarnos de que los propietarios a largo plazo pudieran quedarse en su hogar, que los alquileres a\u00fan fueran asequibles en esa \u00e1rea. Trabajamos con muchas partes interesadas en Woodlawn, en South Shore; trabajamos con los funcionarios electos a nivel local. Entonces creo que tenemos un modelo que ahora estamos transportando a otras partes de la ciudad. Y el West Side, lado Oeste, claramente es uno de ellos. Ahora, el West Side, lado Oeste, comenz\u00f3 a ver c\u00f3mo sub\u00edan los precios de las viviendas, francamente, antes de que yo asumiera el cargo, pero Invest South/West, Invertir en el Sur/Oeste se trata, francamente, de traer unidades m\u00e1s asequibles al West Side, lado Oeste, que actualmente no existen.En 2019 hizo campa\u00f1a como candidata progresista. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, usted se par\u00f3 en Garfield Park y tuvo una conferencia de prensa en la que dijo: \u201clo cerraremos, lo citaremos y, si es necesario, lo arrestaremos\u201d. Durante las protestas del 2020, levant\u00f3 los puentes y expres\u00f3 tu oposici\u00f3n a Defund CPD, desembolsar al CPD. Esas cosas se perciben como las m\u00e1s alejadas de ser progresista.\u00a0\u00a0Si es reelegida, \u00bfc\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago responsabilizarla por las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 esta vez?Me hacen responsable todos los d\u00edas. Cuando eres alcalde, est\u00e1s en primera l\u00ednea, y los habitantes de Chicago no se averg\u00fcenzan de expresar sus opiniones. Y ciertamente no son t\u00edmidos para expresar quejas.\u00a0Mira, te presiono para que encuentres un alcalde m\u00e1s progresista de lo que he sido. S\u00ed, en una emergencia hice lo necesario para asegurarme de que mantuvi\u00e9ramos a salvo a los habitantes de Chicago. Y volvamos al verano del 2022. Cuando observ\u00e9 en c\u00e1mara, multitudes masivas que llegaban al centro de la ciudad incendiaban edificios, volcaban veh\u00edculos. Hab\u00eda un autob\u00fas de la CTA que una multitud intent\u00f3 voltear con gente dentro. Ambulancias, coches de polic\u00eda, era un caos. Y s\u00ed, hicimos lo necesario a instancias de los residentes, las empresas, para mantener segura a nuestra comunidad. No me disculpo por eso. Eso era absolutamente necesario y para salvar vidas. Absolutamente.\u00a0Tuvimos demasiados casos durante COVID en los que las personas ignoraron los consejos de salud p\u00fablica. Lo que sab\u00edamos en esos primeros d\u00edas no era mucho sobre COVID, pero sab\u00edamos dos cosas: que se era contagioso y que era potencialmente mortal. \u00bfY qui\u00e9n muri\u00f3? \u00bfQui\u00e9n fue el m\u00e1s afectado negativamente por COVID? La gente Negra de Chicago.\u00a0Entonces, si observas lo que mencionaste, pero comparas con un registro completo: inversiones hist\u00f3ricas en viviendas asequibles, nunca antes hechas en nuestra ciudad; inversiones hist\u00f3ricas en salud mental, nunca antes hechas en nuestra ciudad; inversiones hist\u00f3ricas en personas sin hogar, nunca se han hecho en nuestra ciudad. Recomponer la red de seguridad social de la manera que lo hemos hecho, siendo inteligentes y usando nuestros d\u00f3lares para asegurarnos de que estamos teniendo impactos duraderos no solo por un minuto, sino para toda la vida. No vas a encontrar a nadie que haya sido m\u00e1s progresista que yo. La gente puede hablar de m\u00e1s, pero he cumplido y seguir\u00e9 cumpliendo una y otra vez."

  "title": "Here\u2019s what Chicago mayoral candidates had to say about policing and incarceration at Monday\u2019s forum",
  "text": "On Feb. 13,\u00a0 NBC 5, WVON, the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) \u2013 Chicago chapter, the Chicago Urban League and the Business Leadership Council hosted a mayoral forum focused on issues relevant to the Black community. NBC 5\u2019s Marion Brooks and WVON\u2019s Matt McGill moderated the forum, and The TRiiBE\u2019s editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden asked questions on behalf of NABJ during the forum as well.Public safety and policing were central topics during the forum. All of the candidates indicated they supported the elimination of cash bail, although businessperson Willie Wilson did not explicitly say so.* Wilson noted that he has personally \u201cspent hundreds of thousands of dollars getting people out\u201d of jail.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot said that while she supports eliminating cash bail, \u201cthe concern is of who is getting out on bail, and the concern is specifically around community safety.\u201d She added that \u201cwe should . . . hold all violent, dangerous and habitual offenders accountable and hold them pretrial.\u201d This echoed a statement Lightfoot made in June 2022 in which she said people accused of violent crimes \u201care guilty.\u201dIn his answer, former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas said he supported no cash bail but added a caveat, saying that he thinks a distinction should be made between violent and nonviolent charges, as well as habitual offenders. Judges \u201caren\u2019t making the right determination\u201d in some cases, according to Vallas. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson said that he \u201cwill trust the discretion of judges in this particular dynamic to determine what is a violent offense and what isn\u2019t.\u201dState representative Kam Buckner noted that he \u201chelped write a good amount of\u201d the Pretrial Fairness Act, which eliminates cash bail. Ald. Sophia King said the elimination of cash bail is more \u201cequitable,\u201d because \u201ca lot of violent rich criminals\u201d are able to pay bail bonds. Activist Ja\u2019Mal Green said that while he agrees with eliminating cash bail, neighborhood investment and better policing are also needed.Ald. Roderick Sawyer said he supports eliminating cash bail, and reiterated judges\u2019 discretion over keeping people they deem a public threat or flight risk held pretrial. \u201cJudges do have the authority to keep someone in jail if they feel they are a threat to others, or a threat to society in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThat portion still stands, and I still support that as well.\u201dHost Marion Brooks asked the candidates, by a show of hands, how many would support keeping ShotSpotter, the controversial gunshot-detection technology deployed across the city. King, Wilson, Vallas, Lightfoot and Sawyer raised their hands; Green, Buckner, Johnson and Garc\u00eda did not.In NBC 5\u2019s spin room following the forum, The TRiiBE also asked Mayor Lightfoot about the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance. The ordinance created the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA), a seven-member body that has police oversight powers, as well as three-member Police District Councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0In 2021, Lightfoot initially resisted organizers\u2019 calls for an all-elected CCPSA. The mayor attempted to pass her own ordinance, which would have kept control of the CCPSA largely in her office, instead of one proposed by organizers. When that failed to pass, Lightfoot agreed to negotiate a compromise ECPS ordinance, which passed in July 2021.Despite the ECPS ordinance mandating the appointment of the CCPSA\u2019s interim commissioners by January 2022, Lightfoot did not seat them until August, which prevented them from reviewing and making recommendations concerning police spending to the mayor\u2019s 2023 budget.\n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.In January, the Chicago Reader reported that at a CCPSA meeting in January 2023, the interim commissioners said that CPD superintendent David Brown had resisted their efforts to set goals for him, a duty that is also mandated by the ordinance. Brown, they said, had repeatedly asserted that the federal consent decree CPD is under prevented the commissioners from setting goals, and only relented the morning of the public meeting.\u00a0When The TRiiBE asked the mayor after the forum how she will ensure the ECPS ordinance\u2019s benchmarks are being met both by her administration and the CPD superintendent, Lightfoot said:\u201cWell, first of all, as you may recall, in leading the Police Accountability Task Force (PATF), I\u2019m the person who authored, along with the other members of PATF, the language that said we need civilian oversight of the police, but we would leave it to the community to decide what form. It took much longer than I would have anticipated. But we laid the framework for that in the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d she said. \u201cSupt. Brown is fully cooperative with the Community Commission. I\u2019m looking forward to the elections that are going to happen to stand up the permanent commission. And we will make sure that we continue to support this new form of civilian oversight of our police department, which is necessary. People in the city want to make sure there\u2019s more transparency, more accountability. And that\u2019s precisely why I was at the table and cut the deal that made it happen in July of 2021. [There\u2019s] more work that we need to do, but we are on our way.\u201dOn Feb. 13, Injustice Watch and WTTW reported on the challenges people who have recently been released from prison face upon returning to their communities. During and after the forum, The TRiiBE asked each of the candidates, \u201cWhat policies will your administration put in place to support currently and formerly incarcerated Chicagoans and their families?\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s what they said:\u00a0Ja\u2019Mal Green: One of the things I\u2019ve done is have a program in Kewanee [Life Skills Re-Entry Center, a prison with programs to help incarcerated people transition that the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) opened in 2017], where we went in to teach them how to transition home with businesses, resumes, affirm them, gave them temporary housing, etc, for all those who graduated the program. We\u2019re going to do that on the city level.\u00a0We\u2019re going to have a reentry program embedded in IDOC as well as Cook County Jail, so when folks come home, they\u2019ve already been through our program, and we give them housing, we give them free counseling as well, we make sure that we partner them with job opportunities. The people who are incarcerated and return home, those are the changemakers of our communities. So we need to put a big budget towards making sure that they have a pathway to middle-class jobs. We got 50,000 manufacturing jobs open. We have trade jobs open. We need a pipeline for them when they return home to make sure that they get in those jobs, and give them the resources and stability until that happens.Sophia King: We have a very comprehensive program that puts hundreds of millions of dollars towards violence intervention, towards those most vulnerable residents, returning citizens and others, that gives them an incentive to come off the street and into a livable economy. That incentive is $600 a week. Then, with that comes responsibilities of job training, trauma-informed care, a real community approach to wraparound services. So you would have their pastor, their commander of police, [and] other stakeholders in the community sitting down and saying, \u201cListen, we know this is a pathway you\u2019ve been on. But this is a pathway you could go on.\u201d And if we put hundreds of millions of dollars into violence intervention in a real way, we can put a dent in this problem so that we\u2019re not back here in 20 years.Kam Buckner: That is a huge issue in this city, and I don\u2019t think that this current administration has done enough. I\u2019ve been on record talking about creating individualized reentry plans for people who are returning from incarceration, because one size does not fit all. There are some folks who need expungement, some folks who need a driver\u2019s license or state ID; there are other folks who need housing help, or other folks who are veterans need to find a way to tap into their federal benefits. So I\u2019ve talked about standing up some real reentry services, but individualizing them so that people can get exactly what they need to be able to one, not [recidivate], and two, be productive members of our society.Willie Wilson: First of all, you have to make sure that the people that get out are trained. I\u2019d work with the Cook County Sheriff so that while those people are incarcerated in there, let\u2019s create a trade school within the prison system itself. So when people get out, they have a good trade that now they can get out with experience. Those people who get out with experience can find good jobs. A lot of them can become entrepreneurs, do business with the City. Set aside the necessary dollars for working with the banks that you do business with to help support small business.\u00a0I\u2019m a businessperson and I understand business. Look, small businesses only go so far. The major corporations can help you grow nationally as well as internationally. We don\u2019t need a lot of small businesses, particularly in minority communities. We need large businesses in minority communities to take small businesses, help develop them, partnership them together for training programs together and expand. We once were a small business. Now we\u2019re international.Brandon Johnson: When I was on the County Board of Commissioners, we put that work in right away. It\u2019s why we eliminated the gang database. It\u2019s a racist system that, quite frankly, did not make anybody safer. So we got rid of that. I passed the Just Housing Ordinance that eliminated housing discrimination for families and individuals who were seeking housing who had previous arrest records. So we\u2019ve eliminated that.\u00a0As the mayor of the city of Chicago, I\u2019m going to invest in workforce development, creating opportunities for families who are seeking real rehabilitation, to have an opportunity to actually have a W-2. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we open up our mental health centers. We [will] pass Treatment Not Trauma. We\u2019re going to have mobile operations to make sure that our students who are experiencing that type of violence and trauma\u2014that is actually quite wicked right now\u2014that they have real outlets. You know, it\u2019s a pretty sad state of affairs when you have an economy that\u2019s addicted to locking up poor Black and brown people in particular. We spend more money on locking individuals up than we do educating them. We spend more money on building buildings than building minds and lives. Under a Johnson administration a better, stronger, safer Chicago is possible, because you\u2019re actually going to have someone who\u2019s prepared to invest in people, and particularly those who are formerly incarcerated.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Paul Vallas: Look, the first thing you have to do is create education and occupational training alternatives to incarceration, so that judges have the option, just as they have the option of putting people in drug rehabilitation instead of being incarcerated, number one. And there\u2019s funding both at the state and federal level to do that. Second thing you have to do is, you really have to open adult and occupational training centers, so when individuals are returning from incarceration, they\u2019re able to work on getting a high school diploma and occupational training, and you need to subsidize them so it almost becomes a work-study job. Because when people are incarcerated, people need to be working while at the same time being trained. And you also have to remove the obstacles to them being hired in the first place, because there are so many obstacles, both in terms of the private sector as well as to City to people formerly incarcerated being hired.Lori Lightfoot: Well, number one, you have to view it as a priority. That\u2019s why for the first time ever, there\u2019s a person in the Mayor\u2019s Office who reports directly to me, who\u2019s from the lived experience as a returning citizen, who focuses like a laser beam on creating opportunities for returning citizens. You cannot talk about public safety unless you create a pathway home for these folks. So number one, you put the resources in, as we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve funded more money for returning residents than any other administration in the history of the city. Number two, you\u2019ve got to break down the barriers for employment. What we know is they face a tremendous amount of challenges, and you gotta lead by example. We\u2019ll be making an announcement later this week that addresses that specific issue. You\u2019ve got to work with the stakeholders out there like Safer [Foundation], like Cara [Collective], like John Howard [Association of Illinois] and other organizations, as we have done.Roderick Sawyer: \u00a0As mayor, I will continue to work I was doing as alderman. I\u2019ve walked the picket lines with returning citizens, making sure that they had an opportunity, particularly with the [Amalgamated Transit Union] workers when the administration was fighting back against us making sure that we can hire returning citizens on CTA jobs. I believe in this: I believe in making sure that people are held accountable, but I also believe in redemption. I want to make sure that those that have served time, that have paid their debt to society have every opportunity to lead a successful and fruitful life here in the city of Chicago. We owe them that. They paid their debt, we want to make sure that they\u2019re not going back, we want to give them every resource, whether it\u2019s job training, whether it\u2019s educational resources, whether it\u2019s assistance in housing, we want to make sure that those returning citizens get everything that they deserve, and have a real shot at the American dream, having a household, raising a family, you know, getting right again.I\u2019m born and raised in the same neighborhood my entire life, which is in the South Side of Chicago in the Grand Crossing neighborhood in Park Manor. I know a lot of people that have gone to jail., I\u2019ll even go further: a lot of my friends had made that wrong decision and had to pay that debt to society, but they paid it, they earned it and they\u2019re leading successful lives\u2014not because they went to jail, but in spite of them going to jail. And what is interesting about a lot of my friends, they go back and reach out to younger people because they don\u2019t want the younger people to make the same type of mistake that they made.\u00a0So this is something I worked on as a young lawyer. I worked on violence prevention when it was not popular, when we weren\u2019t getting millions of dollars to do it. And I worked on it with formerly incarcerated people, with people who have been involved in street organizations, and we assisted in getting that number [of murders] from 980 to about 500 in a year, working with returning citizens, working with people from the street, working with individuals that people don\u2019t even talk to sometimes. I was in the trenches doing that every single day, and I will continue to do that as mayor.Chuy Garc\u00eda:\u00a0 In order for returning citizens to have a shot at reintegrating into the community, they need a variety of things. They need to have support in the community where they\u2019re going to be released to ensure that they have access to housing, that they have access to nutrition, that there are wraparound services like mental health and drug dependency counseling as well. Working with Safer Foundation, one of the leading organizations on the West Side, and other places, with the Revolution Workshop, these are organizations that have modeled the way for effective reintegration into the community. We need to invest, because when we invest in these folks, then the likelihood of success is much greater."

Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired. Lightfoot said doing so would be the easy political thing to do but explained that it wasn\u2019t the appropriate action to take. Instead, she\u2019s calling what happened a teachable moment.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I\u2019m a role model to young women across the city, and I have an obligation given that to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to teach and mentor,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to learn and for me to be a mentor and nurture her,\u201d she added.\u00a0Also, on Thursday, the City Colleges of Chicago confirmed receiving an email from Lightfoot\u2019s campaign last August seeking student volunteers.\u201cCity Colleges staff notified the campaign of CCC\u2019s ethics policy and purged the emails from CCC accounts. City Colleges is not aware of having received subsequent campaign emails but is looking into the matter,\u201d the statement reads.\u00a0On Wednesday evening, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s campaign came under fire after asking Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage students to help her get re-elected in exchange for school credit. WTTW Politics Reporter Heather Cherone first reported the story.\u00a0\u201cLate yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to the campaign . . . a campaign staffer accessed publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a one-on-one interview with The TRiiBE before a Thursday afternoon press conference. \u201cObviously, that was a mistake. From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "title": "Some organizers say Lightfoot\u2019s proposed 2023 budget isn\u2019t doing enough to address homelessness in Chicago",
  "text": "In Chicago, according to Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, home prices have risen 5.2 percent since September 2021, when the media price of homes sold in the Chicago area was $290,000. For the month of September 2022, the median price of homes being sold in the Chicago area was $305,000.Surging housing prices play a significant role for people who experience houselessness.\u00a0For example, insufficient income and a lack of affordable housing are the leading causes of homelessness, according to the National Homelessness Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty. A 2020 report from Housing Action Illinois found that minimum wage workers can\u2019t afford to rent a home at a fair market rate without spending more than 30 percent of their income to do so.\u00a0\u201cThings are going to get worse once it gets cold. It\u2019s going to be more dangerous. And many deaths happen during the winter, just like a lot of deaths happen during the summer when the heat is high,\u201d said April Harris, a grassroots leader of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. Extreme temperatures put people who experience homelessness at risk for death and injury, she added.\u00a0As budget hearings for Chicago enter their final week, homelessness is one of the items on the top of organizers\u2019 minds. Earlier this month, Mayor Lori Lightfoot laid out her $16.4 billion proposed 2023 budget, in which she calls for increased spending on public safety and more investments in pension contributions, abortion care, affordable housing, homelessness prevention and more.\u00a0For example, the 2023 proposed budget asks the city to spend $1.94 billion on the Chicago Police Department (CPD), up from $1.88 billion in 2022.\u00a0However, the proposed budget only seeks $200 million for homeless prevention, which includes increasing shelter capacity and offering rapid re-housing. An additional $3 million would be spent to launch the first-of-its-kind tiny homes project in Chicago.\u00a0Tiny homes are typically less than 500 square feet. The program would create two to three tiny home communities on city-owned land, according to a WBEZ news report.\u00a0The question on many organizers\u2019 minds is: Are the proposed investments in the 2023 budget enough to support the more than 65,000 people that Chicago housing advocates estimate are living on the streets, in shelters or staying with others.\u00a0\u00a0According to Harris and other advocates, the city needs more than a one-time investment to address homelessness.\u201cHousing is a human right in a just society. It\u2019s a necessity. We\u2019re trying to get the mayor and her people to understand,\u201d Harris said about Lightfoot. \u201cShe wants to make a one-time payment, which will not fix the problem. We need to have a dedicated revenue stream.\u201dInstead, Harris and other organizers and stakeholders with the Bring Chicago Home (BCH) coalition are proposing that the city have a designated fund to combat homelessness, one that is not subject to budget fluctuations or priority shifts with changing administrations. This type of fund would develop more affordable housing and wraparound services for people who are experiencing homelessness.\u00a0The BCH coalition has been pushing its proposal since 2019. Harris and other stakeholders are calling on Chicago residents to contact their alderperson and the mayor\u2019s office to support the BCH proposal, which they believe can combat homelessness.\u00a0The BCH coalition invites residents to text \u201cBCH\u201d to 31313 on their mobile phones. From there, users can enter their information to send an online letter to their alderperson, expressing their support of the proposal.The City Council must approve a balanced budget by Dec. 31. The new budget will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2023.\u201cIt is a campaign that\u2019s important to us because we feel it can fix the problem of homelessness in the city of Chicago,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0The BCH proposal calls for restructuring the real estate transfer tax on high-end property sales and imposing a one-time tax on sold properties. Currently, the revenue generated from the tax goes to the city for general corporate purposes. The BCH proposal would have the funds go toward anti-homelessness efforts.Under the proposal, the BCH coalition says the city could invest in new housing, preserve existing affordable housing, rehab vacant properties, provide housing vouchers and more. The additional revenue can also offer wraparound services such as mental health support, job training and youth programming.\u00a0\u201cWe can have more affordable housing and wraparound services, meaning if you have trouble with substance abuse, domestic violence, keeping a job, mental health or childcare, we want to provide all those things. So once people get housing, they stay housed,\u201d Harris said.\u00a0The BCH coalition is working to make its proposal a reality, and there are two ways to go about it, said Nick Jefferson, director of organizing and strategic campaigns at Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH).One way is by getting the Illinois state legislature to vote for legislation allowing Chicago to change its real estate transfer tax.The other way is through a ballot measure, which Jefferson said is the best option.\u00a0The ballot measure would ask Chicago voters if the city should increase the real estate transfer tax by 253 percent for buyers who purchase residential or commercial properties for more than $1 million, and redirect those funds from the city to combat homelessness by providing permanent affordable housing and the services necessary to obtain and maintain permanent housing in Chicago.Under their proposal, the BCH coalition projects that it would generate $163 million annually to support the thousands of people who experience homelessness in Chicago.\u201cWe believe a ballot measure is the best option because it is a city issue, and voters can have a say if they want this or not,\u201d Jefferson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE.\u00a0\u00a0The ballot measure needs City Council approval to appear in the upcoming 2023 Chicago municipal election, which will take place in February. The resolution for the ballot measure was introduced to the City Council\u2019s Committee on Committees Rules on July 21, 2021. However, there hasn\u2019t been any further action on the resolution.\u00a0Affordable housing in ChicagoThe state of affordable housing in Chicago has been an ongoing fight for housing justice advocates in Chicago. COVID-19 exacerbated an already complicated issue, said Parrish Brown, a restorative justice practitioner and former Kenwood Oakland Community Organization (KOCO) organizer.\u00a0\u201cAffordable housing was always an issue. Right now, there\u2019s a ban on rent control at the state level,\u201d Brown said.In 1997, Illinois passed a law called the Rent Control Preemption Act, which prohibits municipalities from enacting, maintaining or enforcing measures to control the rent charged for leasing private residential or commercial property. The law is still in effect today.\u201cWith this ban on rent control, you cannot stop your landlord from increasing yearly because it\u2019s illegal at the state level,\u201d Brown added.Eviction moratoriums and rental assistance programs during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic helped prevent people from being displaced from their homes.However, when Illinois lifted its eviction moratorium in October 2021, eviction rates reached their highest level since the pandemic started, according to an analysis by WBEZ. Sixteen of the top 20 zip codes that experienced the most evictions following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were primarily on the South and West sides.\u00a0\u00a0For affordable housing to be accessible for all, Brown first suggests that Illinois lift the ban on rent control. There\u2019s already a grassroots organization, called the Lift the Ban Coalition, fighting to repeal the law through House Bill 116. The bill passed out of the Illinois House of Representatives Housing Committee on March 24, 2021. To become law, it needs support from the state Senate."

  "text": "Population: 53,526Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0On Jan. 25, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Emma Mitts (37th Ward) and other elected officials gathered in West Humboldt Park for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a police and fire academy that was built despite protests from some community members.\u00a0\u201cI think this is a win for the United States of America since this is the first joint public safety academy in the United States,\u201d Mitts said during the press conference.\u00a0The training facility was five years in the making. In 2019, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s proposal for the multi-million project because they said further investments in police would mean more state-sanctioned violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, through their grassroots campaign, they demanded that the City fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0Despite the protests, the City Council voted 38 to 8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019 (5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston was the only member of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus\u00a0 who voted against it at the time). Last September, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the total cost to $128 million.\u00a0The facility includes a \u201ctactical scenario village\u201d for police and fire training and a six-story tower, with each floor simulating different environments firefighters encounter.\u00a0The facility sits on a 30.4-acre former rail yard that sat vacant for more than 40 years before the City purchased it in 2017. The site will also include two restaurants and 27,000-square-foot Boys and Girls Club, which will open this summer.\u00a0Mitts faces three challengers in the 37th Ward aldermanic race: Corey Dennelle Braddock, Jake Towers and Howard Ray. She was first appointed to the seat in 2000 by then-Mayor Richard M. Daley. Her predecessor, Percy Giles, was convicted of taking a bribe and sentenced to just over three years in prison in 1999.\u00a0During her tenure, Mitts opened the city\u2019s first Walmart, the ward\u2019s first public library branch, and most recently, the police and fire academy. A not-yet-open but completed Amazon warehouse is also situated in the 37th Ward. There\u2019s also a brand-new youth sports and community center, the North Austin Community Center, that opened its doors on Feb. 2.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed two people who live in the 37th Ward. Both residents spoke with pride about the community within their different blocks in Austin. They also expressed passion for the ward\u2019s future and discussed various improvements that could help the 37th Ward, which has experienced decades of disinvestment. Reporter\u2019s note: The TRiiBE interviewed Stamps following a West Side rally for Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson at the Healing Temple Church Banquet Hall in Austin).\u00a0Neighborhood you live in: AustinOccupation: Teacher Assistant at the Chicago Board of EducationHomeowner or renter?

I mean, it\u2019s not the best. It\u2019s not the worst. Most of the homeowners on my block are seniors because they\u2019ve been there for over 30 to 40 years. There are a few newcomers. Some have moved out to other areas, but most people on my block are seniors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0Where do Black people gather and socialize in the 37th Ward? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I think people are indoors. You don\u2019t see people hanging out. It\u2019s not just happening in the 37th Ward. I think Chicago is deserted now due to COVID and the crime rates. People are scared to come out. Kids don\u2019t come out and play as much because there are drive-bys. This is happening all over. It\u2019s not just in the 37th Ward. The West Side Health Authority is on my block on Division. Young folks like to go there. I noticed a lot of them coming around the neighborhood and passing out flyers for different types of events going on. They\u2019re trying to get the young folks to get involved. But it\u2019s kind of hard, though.\u201d\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to vote right now for early voting.

I don\u2019t support the business because of the labor agreements, but as far as bringing resources to the neighborhood, it was a good thing. But as far as them not employing union people, that\u2019s my issue.\u201dWhat do you like about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0"

  "text": "Incumbent: Ald. Chris Taliaferro Headed to runoffContesting candidates:Population: 53,635Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0Austin was once a bustling community area that boasted more than 120,000 middle-class residents at its peak in 1930. There were street railways to downtown every half mile, and booming businesses on Madison Street, Lake Street and Chicago Avenue.\u00a0However, there\u2019s been a tremendous population loss since then. Today, there are just a little over 53,000 residents in Austin, and most of them are Black. And those bustling business corridors are now vacant lots, dilapidated storefronts and crumbling facades after experiencing decades of divestment.In the 29th ward, incumbent Chris Taliaferro is focused on retaining his aldermanic power after a fleeting run for Cook County Judge in 2021. Contesting candidates CB Johnson, who last ran in 1999, Walter Adamcyzk, a republican, and Corey Dooley, who is facing allegations that he is not a registered voter in the ward, have a hard-won battle ahead.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed three Black women who reside in Austin and in Galewood, a small bungalow enclave within the community. Together, they painted an eclectic portrait of a neighborhood that once had rich communal ties but is now lacking affordable housing, political power, amenities such as grocery stores that are abundant in neighboring towns like Oak Park. Neighborhood you live in: GalewoodOccupation: RetiredHomeowner or renter? Homeowner in Galewood for 13 years, and owns another property in Humboldt Park.Do you feel safe? \u201cNowhere is safe in this area. That\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d\u00a0Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cI guess so. I read about him in a paper or something. He\u2019s never come to this block [Newcastle Avenue]. People on this block don\u2019t know who he is. Most of them. And I\u2019ve only seen him at meetings. He\u2019s never ever in the neighborhood.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in person [outside of a political setting] and the one time I reached out to him via email, he responded he would get to repaving our street and alley [in his] next term . . . .Is he really the alderman? Are we in the 29th Ward?\u201d\u00a0What do you like about your ward? \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s nothing to write home about like it was 20 years ago. Because, one thing is, it was like six Blacks on this block when we moved here. Now it\u2019s many more Blacks from Austin that\u2019s on this block now.\u201d\u00a0What do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0How do you get your news? \u201cNextdoor app.\u201d She also used to get a lot of her news from Ald.\u00a0 Nicholas Sposato\u2019s newsletter when she lived in Humboldt Park.What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0More police patrols: \u201cI\u2019ve been here about 13 years and I guess I\u2019ve seen a police car drive through here five times.\u201dNeighborhood you live in: GalewoodOccupation: Retail Store Manager\u00a0Homeowner or renter? Homeowner. Also owns another home in the same neighborhood.Do you feel safe? \u201cYes\u201d.Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cMmhmm. I know he was trying to run for judge but I don\u2019t really know anything [else about him] actually.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him out, only when he was knocking on my door [while campaigning].\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cI\u2019ve owned another house down the street, so 20 years I\u2019ve lived over here. The neighborhood is a quiet neighborhood. Finally, some friendly neighbors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you feel like your neighborhood is communal? \u201cNo, not really. I think on my block it\u2019s more communal, but I think outside of the block, I don\u2019t think people know each other. A lot of blocks have block club parties. We\u2019ve never had one, at least since I\u2019ve been here.\u201dDo you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? I definitely will be up there to vote, as usual. I just voted in this last election. So I definitely plan on voting.\u201dHow do you get your news about the election? \u201cI know Lightfoot\u2019s the current mayor but I don\u2019t know who\u2019s running. I only watch TV. I\u2019ve gotten text messages from different offices.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0\u00a0Neighborhood you live in: AustinOccupation: Associate Political Director for United Working Families. [Editor\u2019s note: United Working Families, which Gardner works for, endorsed Brandon Johnson for mayor]Homeowner or renter? New renter after living in her family\u2019s home in Austin for 30 years. \u201cWe\u2019re being priced out. I\u2019m a little upset at the idea that I can\u2019t afford the houses in the neighborhood that raised me.\u201d\u00a0Do you feel safe? \u201cI absolutely feel safe in all parts of Austin.\u201dDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cYes, I do. Chris Taliaferro.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI know him through family relationships. My mother was an avid supporter of his during his first campaign [for alderperson in 2015]. So I am familiar with him on a more personal level. Now, politically? I am not as keen as I would like to be on his platform. The one thing that I do recall him being open and willing to engage in the conversation was around the Anjanette Young ordinance. He participated in the conversation, but it didn\u2019t pass. I sat on the Concerned Women of Illinois Committee of Rainbow PUSH. And we had a forum where he was open to answering questions from not just the West Side, but the statewide coalition of women, regarding the Anjanette Young ordinance.\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cThe West Side is the best side. It\u2019s the rich history and culture, and the families. I\u2019ve lived in Austin for 37 years. There\u2019s so many other families that have remained in the neighborhood and have survived the concerted efforts of disinvestment. I think that the resiliency and pride of the residents is part of the beauty of Austin. And, I mean, Austin does have some really beautiful homes, and Columbus Park is a very beautiful feature of the community as well.\u201dWhat do you dislike?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes. My parents were politicians so I absolutely do vote. I gotta vote. It\u2019s like brushing my teeth. I truly believe that our power, our voice is in our vote. It hits different now.\u201d"

Ervin Re-electedPopulation:\u00a052,614Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0The 28th Ward is home to some of Chicago\u2019s many cultural gems. The Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the nation, according to the Chicago Park District. Unfortunately, like many majority-Black and brown neighborhoods in Chicago, some of the neighborhoods within the 28th Ward have experienced decades-long disinvestment.\u00a0In Oct. 2021, the ALDI at 3855 W. Madison Street closed without notice. Its closure left just one grocery store in West Garfield Park, a Save-A-Lot at 420 S. Pulaski. The Save-A-Lot temporarily closed in Feb. 2022 due to health code violations. Since then, community members have come together to bridge the gap with access to fresh food and produce. The Garfield Park Grocery Pop Up runs weekly on Tuesdays at 4316 W. Madison. The shop is a full-service supermarket with over 30 types of fruit, vegetables and more.\u00a0According to an analysis by West Side United, people who live on Chicago\u2019s West Side \u201chave a projected life expectancy up to 14 years shorter than people who live downtown.\u201d West Garfield Park residents have a life expectancy of 69 years. In contrast, people who live in Chicago\u2019s Loop have an average life expectancy of 85 years, according to the analysis.\u00a0Although areas within the ward have experienced a lack of investment, community residents remain steadfast in their commitment to helping one another, whether accessing groceries and health and wellness resources.\u00a0A local running group Garfield Park native Jackie Hoffman founded in 2020, called the Peace Runners Club, raises awareness about increasing the life expectancy for West Side residents. The Peace Runners have hosted a Juneteenth 5K run for the last two years.\u00a0There\u2019s also promise in the ward that has residents hopeful about its future. In Jan. 2023, the Pritzker Traubert Foundation announced the Sankofa Wellness Village in West Garfield Park as the second winner of the 2022 Chicago Prize, which provides $10 million in funding. The Garfield Park Rite to Wellness Collaborative is leading the project. The project will provide the neighborhood with health care and wellness programs, before and after-school childcare and employment opportunities.\u00a0Ald. Jason Ervin has led the 28th Ward since mayor Richard M. Daley appointed him in 2011. Ervin is also head of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus. He is seeking his fourth term in office. Three challengers, Beverly Miles, Shawn A. Walker and Timothy Gladney, entered the race to unseat Ervin. By late January, Miles and Walker had been removed from the ballot due to a lack of valid signatures, and Gladney withdrew from the race, which meant that Ervin would have been running unopposed.\u00a0On Feb. 21, following a ruling by the Illinois Appellate Court that Walker had enough signatures, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners agreed and added Walker back onto the ballot. The ruling means incumbent Ald. Ervin is no longer running unopposed.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed four people that are residents of the 28th Ward and asked them about their experiences living and working in the ward and what improvements they\u2019d like to see going forward.\u00a0Neighborhood you live in: AustinNeighborhoods you\u2019ve organized in: Near West Side and Garfield ParkOccupation: Founder of the Westside Cultural Alliance, historian and part-time project manager at Swank PRDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cOf course; it\u2019s Jason Ervin.\u201dWhat do you think your alderperson has done for you and your ward? \u201cI have a pretty positive relationship with him because I\u2019ve known him for over 20 years. What I\u2019ve seen since the Lightfoot administration [started] is more money poured into West Garfield Park than I\u2019ve seen in a long time; prior to that, investments went into East Garfield Park, where the conservatory is.\u201dWhat do you like about working in the 28th Ward? \u201cI like the sense of community. Austin has always been a community where there\u2019s been a lot of investment; it\u2019s considered a middle-class community, especially to Black people. We\u2019ve been getting our part of the resources.\u201dWhat do you dislike about working in the 28th Ward?\u00a0What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward? \u201cOne of the things I think should happen is that I think the community should have a say in what is done with the menu money. [Editor\u2019s note: Each ward is given $1.3 million to be used for a \u201cmenu\u201d of infrastructure maintenance and improvements every year]. In some of the other wards, the community decides what is done with that money; that\u2019s not done in the 28th Ward. We need to have a voice in that.\u201dAre you going to vote in the 2023 municipal election? \u201cYes.\u201dDo you know who you\u2019re going to vote for? \u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019m not sure who I\u2019m going to vote for, [for] alderman or mayor. I know every aldermanic candidate who\u2019s running: Ald. Ervin, Beverly Miles and Shawn Walker. [Editor\u2019s note: Timothy Gladney was initially also running]. Everyone asks me, \u2018Who are you going to vote for?\u2019 I say, \u2018First of all, I wouldn\u2019t tell you.\u2019 I\u2019m going to see how this rolls out because I know good and bad things about all of them. I want to see what they plan on doing for the community. One of the things I look at is how active they\u2019ve been in the community. As far as the mayor is concerned, I\u2019m going to let it get down to four candidates. I\u2019m going to wait until some of them fall off.\u201dReporter\u2019s note: The TRiiBE interviewed Woods ahead of a campaign rally in Garfield Park for Mayor Lori Lightfoot. She received a phone call from a campaign worker inviting her to the rally.Neighborhood you live in: Garfield ParkHomeowner or renter? Homeowner\u00a0Occupation: Manager in the Shared Services Department at US FoodsDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0What do you like about the 28th Ward? \u201cI don\u2019t have a like or dislike. Well, I do have several dislikes. My kids are safe. They\u2019re in a house. We\u2019ve had a lot of turmoil in that area. I didn\u2019t know exactly where I was moving to when I bought the home. So it\u2019s been very interesting.\u201dWhat do you mean by turmoil?\u00a0 \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve had bullets flying near our home. My boys saw people get shot. We talked through it because I am a mom that communicates, and I let them know what goes on outside our home. This is my first time trying to get active in the community.\u201d\u00a0What brings you to today\u2019s rally for Mayor Lori Lightfoot? \u201cI want to do more. So, I would love to build a transitional home for homeless folks or just something in the community. We are in a food desert in this community and it\u2019s not good. So instead of moving to a different state, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to become more active.\u201dAre you a native of Chicago? \u201cYeah, born and raised.\u201dOn the West Side? \u201cNo, I was born on the North Side, but we moved to the West Side when I was 10.\u201d\u00a0What do you dislike about the 28th Ward?What about your block? What\u2019s it like there? \u201cIt\u2019s always been quiet. I live on a block that\u2019s across the street from the expressway. The expressway is loud and noisy. There was a petition to build a wall there, but I don\u2019t know what happened to that.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward? \u201cMore grocery stores and community huddles so we know what\u2019s happening in the ward. So maybe more communication with the community, letting us know about rallies or things. I wouldn\u2019t have been here if I hadn\u2019t gotten a phone call about today\u2019s town hall. That way, we can see what is there for us to do. Maybe even asking the community if we want to be involved. Even if it is volunteer work, a lot of people in the community want to do that. So more community involvement and grocery stores and shopping opportunities, so we don\u2019t have to go to Cicero [Illinois].\u201d\u00a0Are you going to vote in the 2023 municipal election? \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to vote by mail. I have my ballot; I just haven\u2019t made my decisions just yet.\u201dNeighborhood you work in: South AustinOccupation: Executive director of TaskForce Prevention & Community ServicesDo you know who your alderperson is? YesWhat do you think your alderperson has done for you and your ward? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I have been trying to figure that out. I\u2019m sure there are things he has done, but conversations with him would really help me to better understand that. I know there are issues with our community that are not addressed, and part of the reason I wanted to meet with him was to address some of those because I think he has a very powerful platform with him being chair of the Chicago City Council\u2019s Black Caucus. He has an ability to hold the mayor and institutions such as the Chicago Police Department accountable, and I\u2019m curious about what he\u2019s done and what he could do \u2014 but we haven\u2019t been able to meet.\u201dAnd you\u2019ve tried more than once to meet him? \u201cI\u2019ve tried many times to meet him. The TaskForce staff and community members have been passionate about issues concerning violence against trans women as well as many other issues regarding violence that happen. I initially wanted to engage him around those issues; in June, I sent two emails about a week apart, and there was no response. I thought maybe it was the email address and then I sent three more emails; I also emailed his chief of staff and sent one to another person. I got a response saying he\u2019s available on Jan. 4, 2023, so now I have a meeting set up for then. I also want to add that I\u2019ve spoken to other executive directors and community leaders who have had similar issues. I don\u2019t want to bash someone; I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. But when it seems like multiple people have the same issue, it\u2019s not good.\u201dWhat do you like about the 28th Ward? \u201cI think there\u2019s a strong community. I think those within the Austin community are proud of Austin, and they\u2019re about supporting one another. It\u2019s funny because I was just having this conversation with someone and there are issues, for instance, with policing and how that makes us feel less safe instead of more safe, right? But whenever there\u2019s an issue, I feel the people of Austin are really passionate and supportive of their community. Everyone cares for each other. It\u2019s not about \u2018me,\u2019 it\u2019s about \u2018us.\u2019What do you dislike about the 28th Ward?\u00a0What do you mean by structural violence? \u201cI\u2019m talking about the policies and laws as well as the way the system of government is designed, and how that system doesn\u2019t serve our communities well at all. We talk a lot about investing more money into public health, but how much of those dollars are actually reaching the people in the Austin community? How many of those grants are actually going to organizations that serve the Austin community? That, to me, is an example of structural violence. Communities are not getting money, perpetuating a system of oppression. It is an act of violence.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward? \u201cI think he needs to meet with his constituents. We want him to come to TaskForce and have a conversation \u2014 not just with me but with the community we serve. We want him to hear from them because they\u2019re dealing with real issues. I think he has the power to address some serious issues around funding inequities that exist with the organizations in Austin. There are many issues. He\u2019s in this position where he can hold people in power accountable, and it\u2019s just not happening.\u201dAre you going to vote in the 2023 municipal election? \u201cOh, absolutely.\u201dDo you know who you\u2019re going to vote for alderperson or mayor? \u201cI will say this: I think I know but I am remaining open. I\u2019m seeing who\u2019s having the conversations and who\u2019s willing to promote the kinds of policies that we really need. I have had several conversations about our current mayor. While I think it\u2019s amazing how a Black lesbian is a mayor, I think there could be more work around the policies that are implemented that affect the communities she represents. It\u2019s not enough to have representation \u2014 the policies need to be reflected through each and every part of the mayor\u2019s office.\u201dNeighborhood you work in: \u201cI work in the 10 West Side communities area.\u201d\u00a0Occupation: Executive director of West Side United, headquartered in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood.Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cYes; Jason Ervin.\u201dWhat do you think your alderperson has done for you and your ward?\u00a0What do you like about the 28th Ward?\u00a0What do you dislike about the 28th Ward?\u00a0"

  "text": "Incumbent:\u00a0Ald. Monique Scott Headed to runoffContesting candidatesPopulation:\u00a052,205Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewedLandmarksChicago\u2019s 24th Ward is regarded as an important place in Black Chicago history. In the 1960s, its present-day borders served as the stomping grounds for many Black liberation leaders. In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. chose an apartment on 15th Street and Hamlin Avenue in North Lawndale as the base to launch the northern campaign of the Civil Rights Movement, in which he planned to expose discriminatory real-estate practices such as redlining and panic peddling.Same time, North Lawndale is also a place reeling from decades-long tension with systemic racism and police. In July 1966, uprisings broke out after police arrested a Black man for opening a fire hydrant; over the course of two days, more than 200 people were arrested, 30 people were injured and two Black people killed by stray bullets from shootouts between police and snipers.\u00a0At its peak in 1960, the North Lawndale neighborhood alone was home to 113,827 Black residents. Today, the entire 24th Ward, which includes parts of Homan Square, North and South Lawndale and Marshall Square has a population of just 52,205. All of the neighborhoods within the ward are still suffering from decades-long neglect and poverty, with unfortunate stretches of abandoned buildings, littered vacant lots and a big symbol of state violence housed in the Chicago Police Department\u2019s Homan Square black site.\u00a0In 24th Ward, incumbent Ald. Monique Scott has sights on retaining her seat; one that Mayor Lori Lightfoot appointed her to in July 2022 after her brother, former Ald. Michael Scott Jr., retired. Lightfoot went on to appoint Scott Jr. to the Chicago Board of Education, which his father served as president under Mayor Richard M. Daley. Scott Jr. also took on a cushy job at Cinescape Studios as its head of industry and community relations. Prior to July, Scott Jr. had held the seat since 2015.\u00a0There are now seven people challenging his sister for the aldermanic seat.\u00a0For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed three people who are part of the 24th Ward. There is hope that things will turn around economically for the 24th Ward \u2014 and there is straightforward pride in the residents.Neighborhood you grew up in: North LawndaleNeighborhood you live in: South Lawndale/Little VillageNeighborhood you work in: North LawndaleOccupation: Owner of Principle Barbers and visual artistDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cYes, it\u2019s Monique Scott. I don\u2019t know her personally, though; her brother has come to my shop a couple times. My shop has been open technically for four-and-a-half years; with COVID, it\u2019s been like two-and-a-half years.\u201dSince you\u2019ve grown up in that ward, you\u2019ve seen a lot of changes, right? \u201cI have, but not enough. I\u2019ve seen Ogden Avenue [the street where Principle Barbers is] change but not enough in the community.\u201dWhat do you like about working in the 24th Ward? \u201cI like the people and the community connections. More than the buildings, it\u2019s the people.\u201dWhat do you dislike about working in the 24th Ward? \u201cThe obvious things, right? There is crime, poverty \u2014 and no one invests in the community. It seems like the city and state ignore the community. The ward needs funding and resources.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0Are you going to vote in the 2023 municipal election? If not, what would motivate you to vote? I do plan on voting.Do you know who you plan on voting for? Yes and no;\u00a0 it\u2019s a wait-and-see thing right now. Now, for mayor, I know who I\u2019m voting for; that\u2019s an easy one.Neighborhood you live in: North Lawndale. \u201cI live two blocks from my store. My father and grandfather lived there, too. I\u2019ve been there for over 30 years.\u201dOccupation: Owner of Barney\u2019s New Life Health Foods; founder of 1990s house-music label Dance Mania and former owner of Barney\u2019s Records & Variety.Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cIt was Michael Scott but now it\u2019s his sister.\u201dWhat do you like about living and working in the 24th Ward? \u201cI like the people; they\u2019re genuine, to me. I like being able to bring the service to the community. People like [that] there\u2019s a health-food store in the community, and we treat people like they should be treated.What do you dislike about living and working in the 24th Ward? \u201cI wish we had more Black-owned businesses in the ward.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve the 24th Ward? \u201cI do want more Black-owned businesses but I\u2019m not that involved in politics so I don\u2019t know what could be done. The only time we ventured into the political field was with state Rep. Lakesia Collins, with a back-to-school event we were involved in; we worked with her to help give out free lunches.\u201dAre you going to vote in the 2023 municipal election? If not, what would motivate you to vote? \u201cI definitely plan on voting.\u201dDo you have an idea of who you\u2019re going to vote for? I kind of have an idea about who I\u2019m voting for mayor, but I don\u2019t want to say who right now.Neighborhood you grew up in: North LawndaleNeighborhood you go to church in: North Lawndale, Kingdom Culture International MinistriesOccupation: Minister and food-truck ownerDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cYes; Ald. Monique Scott.\u201dWhat do you think your alderperson has done for you and your ward? \u201cThrough my personal interactions with her, I see she\u2019s done pretty well, especially since she\u2019s only been here a few months. She\u2019s been getting into the community; I\u2019ve had a couple meetings with her. She\u2019s been talking about bringing more businesses back.\u201dRiot Fest: \u201cYou know about Riot Fest? I know some of the locals don\u2019t like it because they feel it brings a lot of traffic. But I believe it\u2019s good because it brings money and jobs.\u201d\u00a0What do you like about living and working in the 24th Ward? \u201cI could be biased because I grew up here. I went to Anton Dvorak [School of Excellence] on 16th and Central Park, and I grew up on 18th and Central Park. I like that there are different cultures coming to the ward that are gentrifying the neighborhood.\u201d"

  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Kam Buckner",
  "text": "Kam Buckner quiere recordarles a todos que \u00e9l es un hijo de Chicago. Su familia tiene ra\u00edces en Mississippi; se mudaron a Chicago durante la segunda Gran Migraci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s del brutal linchamiento de Emmett Till en las cercan\u00edas de Money, Mississippi. Buckner, de 37 a\u00f1os, se gradu\u00f3 de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago y se esta orgulloso de ser el \u00fanico candidato en la carrera por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago del 2023 que puede reclamar ese honor: asisti\u00f3 a la Escuela Primaria Clissold en Beverly y luego a la Escuela Secundaria Morgan Park.Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a la alcald\u00eda del 2023, el 2 de enero, Buckner invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a su oficina de campa\u00f1a dentro del centro comercial de 55th y Wentworth Avenue en Washington Park. Se\u00f1al\u00f3 que el \u00e1rea se vio gravemente afectado durante las protestas de verano del 2020.\u201cEn mayo del 2020, despu\u00e9s de la muerte de George Floyd y cuando el malestar social comenz\u00f3 a surgir en todo el pa\u00eds, espec\u00edficamente aqu\u00ed en Chicago, sabemos que muchos de los centros comerciales de la ciudad estaban cerrados\u201d, dijo Buckner, dirigiendo su atenci\u00f3n al mural pintado en la pieza de madera detr\u00e1s de \u00e9l dentro de la oficina. \u201cPero luego tambi\u00e9n vimos una afluencia de muchos artistas de Chicago que tambi\u00e9n pudieron usar la madera como una forma expresiva de contar sus historias. Era una hermosa obra de arte alrededor de la ciudad\u201d.Durante la entrevista, Buckner no se detuvo en el hecho de que su padre fue oficial del Departamento del Sheriff del Condado de Cook durante mucho tiempo, y que tiene un t\u00edo que fue oficial jurado de CPD y otro t\u00edo que fue empleado civil de CPD. En cambio, destac\u00f3 su trabajo como representante estatal para hacer realidad la Ley SAFE-T y la primera junta escolar electa de Chicago. Tambi\u00e9n le preguntamos sobre sus planes de vigilancia y seguridad p\u00fablica en caso de que se convierta en alcalde.\u00a0A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, se mantuvo firme en no aumentar el presupuesto de CPD si era elegido. Sin embargo, habl\u00f3 sobre llenar las posiciones vacantes existentes dentro de CPD y encontrar recursos para poner m\u00e1s detectives en las calles.Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Buckner como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(Esta entrevista ha sido ligeramente editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 el crecer en su entorno su pol\u00edtica, qui\u00e9n es usted y su perspectiva de la vida hoy d\u00eda?Kam Buckner: Yo hablo mucho en esta campa\u00f1a sobre ser un hijo de Chicago. Y para m\u00ed, eso es algo grande, \u00bfverdad? Podr\u00edamos hablar sobre la universidad a la que uno fue y la universidad de derecho y todas esas cosas divertidas. Eso es solo material usado para encontrar trabajo. Pero, literalmente, ser una persona que creci\u00f3 aqu\u00ed, que se gradu\u00f3 de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago, una persona que jug\u00f3 en los parques de Chicago y fue a un campamento de verano en los parques de Chicago y fue uno de los primeros y j\u00f3venes usuarios de la Biblioteca P\u00fablica de Chicago. Chicago realmente est\u00e1 en mi ADN. Est\u00e1 en el centro de lo que soy.Y cuando hablo sobre la raz\u00f3n por la que me postulo para alcalde, cuando hablo sobre el espacio en el que me encuentro hoy, realmente se basa en lo que siento que esta ciudad ha podido brindarme a m\u00ed y a mi familia. Mi madre se mud\u00f3 aqu\u00ed desde Mississippi en 1955. De hecho, se mud\u00f3 aqu\u00ed en septiembre de 1955. Y la raz\u00f3n por la que vino aqu\u00ed fue en agosto del 1955, Emmett Till fue asesinado en el pueblo que estaba al lado del suyo. Y as\u00ed, cuando mi abuela y mi abuelo se enteraron de este ni\u00f1o Negro de Chicago, que vino a Mississippi y fue mutilado, linchado, torturado sin otra raz\u00f3n que el color de su piel, honestamente, ya hab\u00edan tenido suficiente, \u00bfverdad? Mi madre creci\u00f3 viendo linchamientos. Creci\u00f3 lidiando con las cosas que eran fundamentales para Jim Crow. Pero esa fue la gota que colm\u00f3 el vaso para mis abuelos. Y entonces empacaron a les ni\u00f1es e hicieron el viaje a Chicago en busca de seguridad y oportunidades. Y siempre me recuerdo a m\u00ed mismo que as\u00ed es como llegu\u00e9 aqu\u00ed, porque as\u00ed es como lleg\u00f3 mi familia.Se declar\u00f3 culpable de un segundo DUI a principios de este a\u00f1o y dijo que le ense\u00f1\u00f3 una lecci\u00f3n. \u00bfQu\u00e9 lecci\u00f3n aprendio del segundo DUI? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 dice sobre usted como modelo a seguir para los j\u00f3venes Negros de Chicago?He sido muy abierto y transparente sobre mis errores pasados \u200b\u200by mis pasos malos. He asumido la responsabilidad y la rendici\u00f3n de cuentas por ello. He tenido conversaciones sobre esto p\u00fablicamente con mis electores, con mi Dios y mi equipo espiritual y mi familia. Y en los cuatro a\u00f1os que han pasado desde que ocurri\u00f3 el segundo incidente, la gente del Distrito 26 me ha reelegido o ha votado por m\u00ed en cuatro elecciones diferentes desde entonces. El Portavoz de la C\u00e1mara me ha pedido dos veces que sea parte de su equipo de liderazgo. El Black Caucus me ha pedido que los presida, lo cual hice durante algunos momentos muy dif\u00edciles en el 2020. Y terminar\u00e9 mi presidencia en 10 d\u00edas aqu\u00ed. Y creo que est\u00e1 muy claro que me he convertido en una mejor persona desde entonces.Personalmente, han pasado muchas cosas para m\u00ed desde entonces; me case. Soy padre ahora. Entonces, creo que lo que quiero transmitir a los j\u00f3venes, especialmente a los j\u00f3venes Negros de Chicago, es que los errores y los malos pasos no tienen por qu\u00e9 ser su destino final, \u00bfverdad? Todos cometemos errores, y somos afortunados [de] aprender de ellos. Y podemos impartir sabidur\u00eda a otras personas y mostrarles que puedes estar deprimido, pero no est\u00e1s fuera.Creci\u00f3 con una familia muy policiaca. Usted ha dicho que apoya tanto la propuesta de GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book como un aumento en el tama\u00f1o de la fuerza policial. \u00bfQu\u00e9 partes del GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book apoyas? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo funciona eso con su plan para aumentar la fuerza policial?Mi pap\u00e1 estaba en el Departamento del Sheriff del condado de Cook. Mis t\u00edos eran CPD, tanto oficiales juramentados como empleados civiles tambi\u00e9n. Y as\u00ed, no solo apoyo el Libro de la Paz, sino que trabaj\u00e9 con GoodKids MadCity para escribir la contraparte estatal de eso: la Ley de la Paz. B\u00e1sicamente, toma el trabajo que se encuentra en la ordenanza del Libro de la Paz y lo expande a todos los departamentos de polic\u00eda del estado.Cuando hablo de llenar posiciones vacantes, no hablo de aumentar el tama\u00f1o de CPD. Hablo de vacantes que ya existen, pero tambi\u00e9n hablo de crear espacios donde la gente esta involucrada en varias funciones. Tambi\u00e9n hablo, no de un modelo de respondedor de llamadas para llamadas de salud mental como el que existe actualmente, sino de un modelo en el que los polic\u00edas no aparecen en absoluto, donde solo hay un profesional de salud mental capacitado. Creo que eso es todo lo importante para poder sacar adelante a la ciudad.Aumentar el tama\u00f1o del departamento de polic\u00eda no es la respuesta para esto. De lo que suelo hablar es de dos cosas. Veo seguridad p\u00fablica y veo vigilancia p\u00fablica. Creo que la seguridad p\u00fablica es hacer cumplir la ley. Creo que la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley debe existir para cuando suceden cosas adversas, y necesitamos una respuesta a eso. La aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley es receptiva.Desafortunadamente, he visto numerosas veces en mi familia que las personas han sido victimizadas. Mi t\u00edo del que habl\u00e9 antes, que es un empleado civil de CPD, trabajaba en el espacio de equipos en la sede en la calle 35. Y en el 2016, lo mataron a tiros mientras sacaba la compra de su autom\u00f3vil en el vecindario de Morgan Park donde crec\u00ed. Y recuerdo el proceso de pasar por el proceso con los detectives para encontrar qui\u00e9n lo hizo. Result\u00f3 ser un hombre joven, creo que ten\u00eda 16 a\u00f1os en ese momento, dispar\u00f3 al otro lado de la calle a otro joven y mi t\u00edo recibi\u00f3 un disparo. Pero estas historias son demasiado reales. Y son historias cotidianas en la ciudad. Y una vez m\u00e1s, creo que necesitamos tener un aparato que sea capaz de responder cuando sucedan estas cosas. Pero tambi\u00e9n, debemos ser preventivos y proactivos y brindar a las personas lo que necesitan para estar seguros y sentirse seguros.Cuando dices que apoyaste a GoodKids MadCity y que te gust\u00f3 la redacci\u00f3n del Libro de la Paz, \u00bfImplementar\u00e1 el Libro de la Paz?Absolutamente. Dos de las cosas que deber\u00edan ser los primeros puntos en mi plan de seguridad p\u00fablica. La ordenanza del Libro de la Paz, la implementar\u00e9. Trabajar\u00e9 para lograrlo desde el primer d\u00eda, y tambi\u00e9n la ordenanza de Anjanette Young.Los organizadores han pedido m\u00e1s medidas preventivas de salud mental para contrarrestar parte de la violencia que vemos. As\u00ed que hemos tenido esa conversaci\u00f3n muchas veces. Los l\u00edderes han tenido esta conversaci\u00f3n muchas veces, pero luego, cuando la gente asume el cargo, no vemos eso. Todav\u00eda vemos el aumento del presupuesto de la polic\u00eda. Hay llamadas para tener m\u00e1s polic\u00edas en la calle. \u00bfTiene alguna pol\u00edtica que est\u00e9 pensando en elaborar o que ya haya elaborado que realmente muestre c\u00f3mo podr\u00edan ser estas dos instituciones? Esta idea de medidas preventivas y vigilancia? Cuando mencion\u00f3 que la polic\u00eda respond\u00eda a ciertos delitos, \u00bfqu\u00e9 delitos? \u00bfC\u00f3mo funciona?Creo que tienes raz\u00f3n. Creo que nosotros, especialmente con esta alcalde actual, lo llamar\u00e9 como es. Nos vendieron una lista de bienes. Y una vez que prest\u00f3 juramento, casi de inmediato dio marcha atr\u00e1s en tantas cosas que muchos de nosotros est\u00e1bamos entusiasmados por en la ciudad. Y es decepcionante, por decir lo menos. Pero como he dicho muchas veces en esta campa\u00f1a electoral, los pol\u00edticos hacen promesas, los l\u00edderes las cumplen, lo cual esta alcalde no ha cumplido. Y entonces tenemos que responsabilizarla por eso.\u00a0En mi plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, que se llama Safer 77, siendo un gui\u00f1o a las 77 comunidades en Chicago, hablo mucho sobre asegurarme de que el CPD no se pueda enfocar de la misma manera en delitos menores, me refiero a delitos que son m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y no violentos. Tenemos una tasa de resoluci\u00f3n del 20% en homicidios. No importa d\u00f3nde caigas en esta conversaci\u00f3n, no hay nadie que me diga que est\u00e1 de acuerdo con un 80% de posibilidades de matar a alguien en Chicago y nunca tener que pagar por ello. Eso es problem\u00e1tico.\u00a0Entonces, en mi plan, hablo mucho sobre proporcionar recursos para poner m\u00e1s detectives en las calles. No se trata de alguien que te detiene por una placa vencida y luego te arresta por tener mota en el auto.Cuando dices m\u00e1s detectives en las calles, si suena como m\u00e1s vigilancia.S\u00ed. No, absolutamente. Cuando me siento con familias en mi distrito de representaci\u00f3n estatal, espec\u00edficamente familias que han perdido a j\u00f3venes, quieren m\u00e1s detectives. Una vez m\u00e1s, los detectives no son polic\u00edas que van a encerrar a la gente. No est\u00e1n llamando a tu puerta. Est\u00e1n resolviendo cr\u00edmenes y resolviendo asesinatos espec\u00edficamente.\u00a0Hace dos a\u00f1os en el D\u00eda del Trabajador, hab\u00eda un [ni\u00f1e de 4 a\u00f1os] llamado [Mychael] \"MJ\" Moultry Jr. y lo mataron en mi distrito, de hecho, lo mataron al otro lado de la calle de un parque que lleva el nombre de la madre de Emmett Till. Cierto. Y habl\u00e9 mucho con sus padres. Habl\u00e9 con ellos durante estas vacaciones, solo para ver c\u00f3mo estaban porque s\u00e9 que fue dif\u00edcil para ellos. Y cuando hablo con gente as\u00ed, y no tienen respuestas sobre la muerte de su hijo, no hay respuestas. El alcalde sali\u00f3 e hizo una conferencia de prensa. Pero luego las llamadas de CPD pararon. Y es porque dijeron que no tienen la mano de obra para hacerlo. Eso es un gran fracaso para m\u00ed.No quiero aumentar el estado policial. No creo que debamos inundar nuestras calles con m\u00e1s oficiales para vigilar de manera inconstitucional. Creo que tenemos algunos problemas reales. Si lee el decreto de consentimiento, ver\u00e1 que tenemos un largo camino por recorrer. Pero lo que s\u00ed creo es que debemos comenzar a cerrar y consolar a las familias de la ciudad que han sido v\u00edctimas de la violencia, espec\u00edficamente, como dije, a los j\u00f3venes. Si te dijera cu\u00e1nto tiempo pas\u00e9 hablando con padres que han perdido a sus hijos, es una acusaci\u00f3n realmente condenatoria de hacia d\u00f3nde hemos ido como sociedad.Su lenguaje da ley y orden. A primera vista, parece que es un candidato a favor de la polic\u00eda. Y para nuestra audiencia que puede estar tratando de decidir qui\u00e9n es el candidato m\u00e1s progresista, creo que necesitan un poco m\u00e1s de informaci\u00f3n sobre cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su inversi\u00f3n en la vigilancia. Mencion\u00f3 detectives. \u00bfHay algo mas? Cuando se trata del presupuesto de la polic\u00eda, \u00bfpuede ser espec\u00edfico acerca de c\u00f3mo cambiar los n\u00fameros?Para m\u00ed, cuando hablo de poder brindar seguridad y justicia, me estoy asegurando de que el presupuesto de CPD no vuelva a poner m\u00e1s oficiales en las calles para ocupar nuestras comunidades. Ese no es el camino a seguir. No es as\u00ed como hacemos que las personas est\u00e9n m\u00e1s seguras.Lo que tambi\u00e9n he dicho es que no podemos hablar lo suficiente sobre la violencia que est\u00e1 ocurriendo en nuestras comunidades hasta que hablemos lo suficiente sobre la violencia que ha ocurrido en nuestras comunidades. Me refiero a negligencia benigna. Me refiero a eliminar recursos. Quiero decir que est\u00e1 el cierre de m\u00e1s de 50 escuelas. Pienso [sobre] la criminalizaci\u00f3n de ser Negro. Hemos visto eso en Chicago durante demasiado tiempo. As\u00ed que tenemos que ser capaces de lidiar con esos problemas.He hablado espec\u00edficamente con hombres Negros j\u00f3venes en esta ciudad que han querido seguir una carrera en la aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley. Y eso es algo que quieren hacer, porque sienten que pueden retribuir a su comunidad de esa manera. Pero a estos muchachos, ya sea porque est\u00e1n en una base de datos de pandillas o porque han tenido un cargo por marihuana, que ahora es legal, en alg\u00fan momento de sus vidas, se les ha dicho que no pueden servir a su comunidad de esa manera. Eso es problem\u00e1tico. As\u00ed que habl\u00e9 sobre eso, tambi\u00e9n en mi plan, eliminar algunas de esas barreras que han hecho que el departamento de polic\u00eda sea m\u00e1s racista y m\u00e1s monol\u00edtico de una manera que no ha sido \u00fatil para nuestras comunidades. As\u00ed que seguro que fue un gran problema para m\u00ed.\u00a0Pero tambi\u00e9n hablo de CPD que actualmente usa este modelo de co-respondedor ahora, donde es un programa piloto, pero est\u00e1n enviando a un profesional de salud mental y a un polic\u00eda cuando alguien tiene una llamada de salud mental. Para m\u00ed, eso no est\u00e1 bien, no creo que sea lo correcto. Porque si vienes a la escena en la que estoy y estoy teniendo un episodio de salud mental, quiero decir, no voy a ver al tipo con el portapapeles. Voy a ver al tipo con el arma y la placa.Cuando pienso en Quintonio LeGrier, quien fue asesinado el d\u00eda despu\u00e9s de Navidad en el 2015. El joven llam\u00f3 CPD el misno. Hizo varias llamadas diciendo que no se sent\u00eda bien. Estaba teniendo un episodio de salud mental. Y quer\u00eda ayuda. Y mandaron a dos oficiales, con las armas en la mano, a ir a ayudar a un se\u00f1or que dijo que ten\u00eda un problema y lo terminaron matando. Atravesaron a tiros el edificio de al lado y mataron a Bettie Jones, su vecina de al lado, que estaba en su sof\u00e1 viendo la televisi\u00f3n. No hay forma de que puedas hacerme pensar que un modelo de co-respondedor detiene eso, pero \u00bfsabes qu\u00e9 lo detiene? Si aparece alguien sin un arma.Entonces, cuando hablo de reposicionar el presupuesto, no he llegado a detalles muy profundos porque, como dije antes, CPD miente sobre c\u00f3mo es su presupuesto. Tienes que meterte y ver debajo, una vez que est\u00e9s en el cargo, para ver d\u00f3nde se alinean esas cosas. Pero realmente creo que tiene que haber dinero all\u00ed para que, una vez m\u00e1s, [tengamos] profesionales de la salud mental, trabajadores sociales, y que la gente pueda ser parte de las decisiones. Y hablo mucho sobre la fuerza policial y la seguridad p\u00fablica. Es porque no creo que necesites a una persona con un arma y una placa para hacer todo, y tenemos j\u00f3venes en Chicago que no quieren ser polic\u00edas pero quieren estar en el espacio de seguridad p\u00fablica de las fuerzas del orden. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no hay puestos de trabajo dentro del departamento para ellos?As\u00ed que no basta con cambiar la polic\u00eda en Chicago, tenemos que cambiar Chicago, y eso tiene que empezar con tener un liderazgo en el consejal que pueda tomar las decisiones dif\u00edciles sobre lo que estamos haciendo. No est\u00e1 aumentando el presupuesto de CPD mientras las tasas de autorizaci\u00f3n siguen bajando. No es m\u00e1s dinero en los espacios que han sido problem\u00e1ticos dada la relaci\u00f3n de CPD con la comunidad.\u00a0Yo no dir\u00eda que es pro-polic\u00eda en absoluto. Todo lo que he tratado de transmitir es realmente pro-Chicago. Lo he dicho y lo dir\u00e9 de nuevo: las comunidades de Chicago saben lo que necesitan para estar seguras. Necesitamos escuchar a la gente. Eso no est\u00e1 sucediendo actualmente. Y he hecho de eso un pilar del trabajo que quiero hacer como alcalde.CPD recibe gran parte del presupuesto de la ciudad. Con algunas de las ideas que tiene en mente, como las que acaba de mencionar con la seguridad, \u00bfc\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda cosas como esas? \u00bfDe d\u00f3nde proviene la financiaci\u00f3n?Cuando hablas de la seguridad p\u00fablica de la fuerza policial, creo que hay ciertas cosas que no se incluir\u00e1n en el presupuesto de la CPD. As\u00ed que creo que mueves algunos de esos n\u00fameros. Creo que hay formas de mover algo de lo que ya est\u00e1 en el presupuesto de CPD. Una vez m\u00e1s, CPD no ha sido muy comunicativo con respecto a d\u00f3nde est\u00e1n poniendo todo su dinero. Pero estar\u00e9 dispuesto a apostar, que es hac\u00eda art\u00edculos ciegos para militarizaci\u00f3n y equipo, como, tienen que irse. Estoy seguro de que est\u00e1 ah\u00ed. Eso tiene que irse. Entonces podemos tomar eso y poner a un trabajador social o profesional de la salud mental en las listas. Vamos a hacer eso.\u00a0Creo que parte del presupuesto es una divisi\u00f3n entre CPD y, obviamente, tambi\u00e9n el Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica de Chicago. El dinero est\u00e1 ah\u00ed.Lo que tambi\u00e9n es cierto es que nos hemos perdido muchos d\u00f3lares estatales y federales porque no hemos querido tener una infraestructura de salud mental en esta ciudad. Hay ciudades en todo el pa\u00eds (Austin, Texas, Filadelfia) que est\u00e1n recibiendo mucho dinero del gobierno federal porque tienen un plan. Y no lo hacemos, as\u00ed que nos lo estamos perdiendo, y eso cambiar\u00e1\u00bfC\u00f3mo se siente acerca de la Ley SAFE-T? \u00bfEs algo que apoya?Ayud\u00e9 a escribirla. Trabaj\u00e9 muy duro para avanzarla. He trabajado muy duro durante los \u00faltimos meses para defenderla en p\u00fablico, especialmente de las mentiras y los ataques directos a la ley. Y te dir\u00e9 esto, s\u00e9 que es monumental. Y otras personas en este pa\u00eds est\u00e1n observando para ver qu\u00e9 sucede con eso. Y continuar\u00e9 luchando por ello en Springfield y en cualquier otro lugar donde pueda.Creo que tomamos medidas valientes para desmantelar un sistema que te trata mejor si eres culpable y tienes los medios que si eres inocente y no tienes los medios. Entonces, cuando desmantelas y atacas sistemas como ese, te atacar\u00e1n de vuelta, lo cual es lo que estamos viendo hoy con la implementaci\u00f3n y el lanzamiento de la Ley SAFE-T. Pero conf\u00edo en que comenzar\u00e1 a tomar forma y la gente ver\u00e1 que nos convertimos en una sociedad m\u00e1s segura cuando no controlamos en exceso, cuando hay rendici\u00f3n de cuentas, cuando hay transparencia y cuando hay formas reales de medir el \u00e9xito.\u00bfExiste una correlaci\u00f3n entre la salud mental y la violencia en Chicago? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo piensa acerca de esta correlaci\u00f3n al redactar ideas sobre pol\u00edticas relacionadas con la seguridad y la salud mental?Creo que hay enormes correlaciones. Honestamente, les dir\u00e9, creo que ten\u00edamos un problema de salud mental en la ciudad antes de la pandemia, pero creo que solo est\u00e1 empeorando en los \u00faltimos dos, casi tres a\u00f1os, lo cual es una locura. Tenemos que ser realistas sobre el trauma perpetuo por el que hemos hecho pasar a nuestras comunidades, espec\u00edficamente a nuestros j\u00f3venes.Estaba hablando con algunos j\u00f3venes en una escuela de mi distrito, Doolittle en la calle 35. Y estos j\u00f3venes no solo ten\u00edan dos o tres compa\u00f1eros de clase que hab\u00edan muerto, asesinados a tiros en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, sino que un joven me estaba contando sobre todos los tiroteos que vio durante el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o, y lo guarda en secreto, y no hay nadie con quien puedas hablar. En la escuela, no hay nadie con quien pueda hablar en el espacio que pueda ayudarlo a superar ese trauma. Estamos poniendo este trastorno de estr\u00e9s postraum\u00e1tico en nuestros j\u00f3venes que no tienen forma de lidiar con \u00e9l.En mi plan de salud mental, solicito la reapertura de 20 centros de salud mental en la ciudad y hacer que varios de esos centros funcionen las 24 horas para que las personas puedan ingresar durante todo el d\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s, armar unidades m\u00f3viles para que las personas puedan buscar ayuda sin importar en qu\u00e9 parte de la calle se encuentren. Y creo que todo eso importa. Nos aseguraremos de hacerlo. He hablado de poner profesionales de la salud mental en todas nuestras escuelas de Chicago. Creo que eso es extremadamente importante.Y una cosa de la que no hablamos lo suficiente es la eliminaci\u00f3n de las tuber\u00edas contaminadas de plomo. Sabemos que nuestros j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n siendo envenenados. Y la ciudad ha dicho: \"Bueno, escucha, si tienes tuber\u00edas contaminadas de plomo, tienes que resolverlo t\u00fa mismo\". La verdad del asunto es que este es un problema de la ciudad. La raz\u00f3n por la que tenemos m\u00e1s l\u00edneas de servicio de plomo en esta ciudad que en cualquier otro lugar del pa\u00eds es porque hasta la d\u00e9cada de 1980, el C\u00f3digo de Chicago exig\u00eda que se usara plomo para las l\u00edneas de servicio. As\u00ed que la ciudad tiene que dar un paso al frente y decir: \"Escucha, hemos hecho esto mal, tenemos que arreglar esto\". No me puede decir que no hay correlaci\u00f3n entre las l\u00edneas de servicio contaminadas de plomo aqu\u00ed y la violencia en la ciudad, cuando se trata de algunos de los problemas de salud mental que existen. Creo que est\u00e1 claro, y tenemos que ser capaces de resolverlo.\u00bfApoya Tratamiento No Trauma? Y si es as\u00ed, \u00bfc\u00f3mo encaja eso con las ideas y pol\u00edticas que tiene sobre la salud mental y la seguridad?S\u00ed. Y cuando constru\u00ed mi plan de salud mental, hace unos tres meses, es muy similar al trabajo que Tratamiento [No] Trauma ha tratado de presentar.\u00bfQu\u00e9 es diferente en el tuyo en comparaci\u00f3n con la ordenanza Tratamiento No Trauma original?Mi plan es un poco m\u00e1s robusto. Hablo m\u00e1s sobre las operaciones reales de las instalaciones de salud mental. Pero mi plan se inspir\u00f3 en el trabajo de Tratamiento [No] Trauma.La alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot prometi\u00f3 una junta escolar electa. Y sabemos c\u00f3mo result\u00f3 eso. \u00bfApoyar\u00e1 una junta escolar electa si es elegido alcalde?Estoy tratando de decir esto de una manera m\u00e1s humilde. Cuando la alcaldesa se retracto de su promesa de darle a la gente de Chicago una junta escolar electa, lo mismo que tienen todos los dem\u00e1s distritos escolares de este estado, fue mi liderazgo en Springfield el que la super\u00f3, que nos llev\u00f3 all\u00ed. Y entonces, no solo apoyo a la junta escolar electa, sino que estoy muy orgulloso del hecho de que pude ayudar a que ese proyecto de ley llegara a la meta. Estoy muy orgulloso del hecho de que el proyecto de ley de la junta escolar electa que presentamos un par de meses despu\u00e9s fue el proyecto de ley que escrib\u00ed y que aprob\u00e9, que tambi\u00e9n impuso una moratoria sobre el cierre de escuelas en Chicago hasta despu\u00e9s de la elecci\u00f3n. La junta escolar est\u00e1 completamente lista. Porque sabemos lo que han hecho los cierres de escuelas en su comunidad y parec\u00eda que el alcalde estaba buscando hacer m\u00e1s de ellos.Mi madre pas\u00f3 35 a\u00f1os como maestra en las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago. Mi hermana peque\u00f1a es maestra de una escuela p\u00fablica de Chicago en el lado sur de Chicago. Mi hermana mayor es directora de una Escuela P\u00fablica de Chicago en Austin ahora mismo en el West Side. Esto es s\u00faper importante para m\u00ed. Y tenemos que asegurarnos de hacerlo bien.El pr\u00f3ximo alcalde puede elegir la mitad de esa junta porque la junta h\u00edbrida comienza en el 2024. Pero creo que no solo debemos tener un alcalde que adopte la forma en que funciona esta junta, sino que est\u00e9 dispuesto a trabajar con esta junta. Una cosa que hemos visto con este alcalde es la falta de voluntad para trabajar con personas que son parte interesadas, ya sea el Concejo Municipal o grupos comunitarios, y eso es un problema. La raz\u00f3n por la que es un problema realmente grande en los pr\u00f3ximos cuatro a\u00f1os es porque tenemos una junta escolar de 21 miembros en camino. Tenemos 66 miembros de los consejos de distrito de la polic\u00eda. No veo a este alcalde trabajando con ninguno de esos grupos. Entonces, la \u00fanica forma apropiada para que la ciudad avance es tener un alcalde que pueda trabajar con todas esas entidades de manera respetuosa. Y he demostrado que puedo hacer eso.Cuando piensa en qui\u00e9nes deber\u00edan formar parte de esta junta, \u00bfqu\u00e9 tipo de personas seleccionar\u00eda para ella, en caso de ser elegido alcalde? Cu\u00e9ntenos un poco sobre lo que pasa por su mente en t\u00e9rminos de elegir personas para la junta.Personas que se han comprometido con nuestros j\u00f3venes. Las personas que, ya sean miembros de LSC de la comunidad, o personas que han trabajado en la educaci\u00f3n y en torno a ella, creo que eso es importante. Personas que son padres de estudiantes de CPS. Personas que tienen un inter\u00e9s creado en este distrito. Personas que tienen algo de experiencia en c\u00f3mo hacemos crecer la inscripci\u00f3n. Creo que CPS ha perdido ni\u00f1es durante los \u00faltimos 11 a\u00f1os. \u00bfQu\u00e9 hacemos para que este sea un sistema escolar de primer nivel? \u00bfC\u00f3mo damos a nuestros j\u00f3venes los recursos que necesitan? Entonces, las personas que piensan as\u00ed y que no est\u00e1n preocupadas por los t\u00edtulos, pero que realmente quieren trabajar y obtener algunos resultados.Durante d\u00e9cadas, el alcalde en ejercicio de Chicago ha estado en desacuerdo con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago y con muchos de los maestros, el personal e incluso los estudiantes de base que se quejan de la falta de recursos y las malas condiciones dentro de las escuelas. Todos hemos estado dentro de las escuelas de CPS, especialmente en los vecindarios Negros, y es necesario que haya alguna mejor\u00eda all\u00ed. \u00bfCu\u00e1l cree que es la desconexi\u00f3n?Sabes, no puedo decirte que lo s\u00e9. Pero s\u00ed s\u00e9 que la desconexi\u00f3n ha hecho que sea extremadamente dif\u00edcil para nuestros j\u00f3venes aprender, tener \u00e9xito y crecer. Y los estamos preparando para el fracaso. Y eso es problem\u00e1tico.Lo que he dicho es que el contrato del sindicato de maestros se acerca el 30 de junio de 2024. Lo que he prometido es que no esperar\u00e9 hasta el 15 de junio para negociar el nuevo contrato. Lo har\u00e9 el primer d\u00eda. Y no lo har\u00e9 desde detr\u00e1s del podio, ni por nota de prensa ni por tuit. Pero negociar\u00e9 de buena fe. Y lo har\u00e9 yo mismo, si es necesario, desde la mesa de mi cocina. Porque necesitamos cierta estabilidad en esta conversaci\u00f3n entre el ayuntamiento, CPS y el sindicato de maestros, y no ha existido. Esto es muy personal para m\u00ed.Cuando me convierta en el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago, ser\u00e9 el primer alcalde graduado de CPS desde Harold Washington. Eso es un gran problema para m\u00ed. \u00bfPreguntaste antes c\u00f3mo mi educaci\u00f3n contextualiza mi pol\u00edtica? Esto es lo que soy. Y estoy cansado de que CPS sea el hazmerre\u00edr. Estoy cansado de que no brindemos lo que nuestros j\u00f3venes necesitan. Una ni\u00f1a peque\u00f1a en Austin o un ni\u00f1o peque\u00f1o en Bronzeville no solo compiten contra un ni\u00f1e de Evanston o Oak Park, o un ni\u00f1e de Wisconsin o Indiana. Est\u00e1n compitiendo contra ni\u00f1es de todo el mundo. Esta es una econom\u00eda global en la que hemos ingresado y no hemos puesto a nuestros j\u00f3venes en esta ciudad en una posici\u00f3n para capitalizar eso. Tenemos que.\u00bfTiene alguna pol\u00edtica en la cual esta trabajando o redactando sobre CPS y c\u00f3mo mejorar las escuelas en particular cuando hablamos de escuelas en vecindarios Negros y Latine?Creo que probablemente sea la \u00fanica persona en esta contienda que present\u00f3 un plan de educaci\u00f3n real en septiembre. Nos paramos frente a una escuela cerrada en East Garfield Park. El alcalde Emanuel los hab\u00eda cerrado y nos unimos a la comunidad para presentar nuestro plan. Dwayne Truss, quien era un miembro de la junta escolar que el alcalde Lightfoot expuls\u00f3 porque no hizo lo que ella quer\u00eda que hiciera, estuvo con nosotros para respaldar nuestro plan educativo y hablar sobre lo importante que era que pudi\u00e9ramos mejorar a CPS, para ponerlo en marcha.Creo que una de las piezas m\u00e1s importantes que ser\u00e1 \u00fatil a medida que avanzamos es que debemos tener los recursos de Springfield para que esto suceda. He luchado por m\u00e1s fondos para las escuelas en Springfield desde que llegu\u00e9 all\u00ed. Y hemos podido aumentar el presupuesto cada a\u00f1o.El primer d\u00eda, tenemos que tener un alcalde que pueda entrar en la I-55 e ir al Capitolio y hacer que las cosas sucedan. Nadie en esta carrera puede tener el impacto que se necesita en Springfield para traer recursos a nuestras escuelas como yo puedo.\u00bfCon qui\u00e9n tiene que hablar en Springfield para hacer eso?Bueno, el presidente de la C\u00e1mara, el presidente del Senado y el gobernador. Esas son las personas que realmente est\u00e1n a cargo all\u00ed. Y obviamente, he tenido una gran relaci\u00f3n con los tres. Trabajo muy bien con los tres. He logrado que se apruebe una legislaci\u00f3n monumental all\u00ed.Hist\u00f3ricamente, hemos visto grandes desarrollos que han desplazado y borrado a comunidades Negras en Chicago, por ejemplo, vimos que sucedi\u00f3 con la construcci\u00f3n de la Universidad de Illinois en el West Side y el distrito m\u00e9dico circundante. Lo hemos visto con la construcci\u00f3n de la Autopista 290 en el West Side. \u00bfC\u00f3mo crear\u00eda pol\u00edticas para apoyar a los residentes Negros a quienes algunos de los nuevos desarrollos, como el Centro Presidencial Obama o el casino que llegar\u00e1 a Cabrini Green, est\u00e1n pagando por los precios?He sido un gran defensor de asegurarme de que tengamos acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios que hayamos convertido en ley, cosas que protejan a las comunidades. Anteriormente trabaj\u00e9 para los Cachorros de Chicago. Y cuando trabaj\u00e9 para esa organizaci\u00f3n, me qued\u00e9 impresionado cuando me di cuenta por primera vez de que literalmente existe una ordenanza municipal para proteger a la comunidad de Lakeview del equipo de los Cachorros. Se llamaba Ordenanza de Protecci\u00f3n de Vecindarios. Y requiere que el club de b\u00e9isbol brinde una cierta cantidad de seguridad y limpieza de basura y dinero caritativo a las organizaciones en el \u00e1rea. Hay muchas cosas que pueden suceder cuando una comunidad se pone de pie. Pero creo que los funcionarios deben poder construir esas protecciones para las comunidades y no hemos visto eso.He apoyado a las personas que pidieron el acuerdo de beneficios comunitarios para Woodlawn y Washington Park, alrededor del Centro Presidencial Obama. No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 va a pasar en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os con el sitio de US Steel en el lado sureste de Chicago, en una comunidad que ha sido una zona de sacrificio por da\u00f1os industriales y fallas ambientales. Y entonces tenemos que empezar a pensar en c\u00f3mo protegemos a esa gente.Tenemos que asegurarnos de que estamos protegiendo a estas comunidades. Lo he hecho en mi papel como representante estatal. Creo que, como alcalde, creo que tambi\u00e9n tenemos que institucionalizar la protecci\u00f3n de estas comunidades de estos grandes desarrollos. Y por eso no he sido t\u00edmido a la hora de rechazar algunos de estos desarrollos m\u00e1s grandes. De hecho, hay un desarrollo o un desarrollo propuesto en mi distrito de representaci\u00f3n estatal, llamado One Central, que se supone que se construir\u00e1 al otro lado de la calle de Soldier Field. Y si miras la cobertura de noticias sobre eso, he sido la \u00fanica persona que retrocedi\u00f3 para asegurarme de que la comunidad tenga voz en lo que sucede en ese espacio. Y eso es esto, mi marca registrada. Me lo tomo muy en serio.\u00bfC\u00f3mo le hace para cumplir algo as\u00ed? Incluso con el CBA que est\u00e1 en Woodlawn alrededor de la Biblioteca Obama en este momento, la gente todav\u00eda sigue siendo desplazada por costo que sigue subiendo.Yo que creo que el Departamento de Vivienda tiene que ser m\u00e1s agresivo y asegurarse de que no estamos dejando que el mercado fluct\u00fae tanto que estamos poniendo a la gente en la posicion que ya no puede pagar su renta o comprar una casa porque subio mucho de precio.Vivo en Bronzeville. Hay una casa al otro lado de la calle que cuesta un poco m\u00e1s de $ 700,000, lo que para m\u00ed es una estupidez. No puedo creer eso. Pero estamos viendo eso. Entonces, cuando hablamos de la estabilidad de la renta, cuando hablamos de asegurarnos de que a las personas no se les subestime el precio, de que las personas no gasten m\u00e1s del 30 % de sus ingresos en el lugar donde viven, creo que el departamento de vivienda de la ciudad tiene mucho que puede hacer. Tenemos que ser m\u00e1s inteligentes sobre la forma en que funciona la zonificaci\u00f3n espec\u00edficamente en comunidades que est\u00e1n a la orilla de la gentrificaci\u00f3n. Tenemos que asegurarnos de no desplazar a la gente. Hay algunas cosas que creo que se pueden hacer a trav\u00e9s del c\u00f3digo de zonificaci\u00f3n para que eso tambi\u00e9n sea efectivo.Muchos de los donantes de su campa\u00f1a provienen de grandes empresas y residen fuera de Chicago. \u00bfC\u00f3mo describir\u00eda a algunas de las personas y grupos que lo han respaldado? \u00bfY c\u00f3mo es usted responsable ante ellos? \u00bfHa tenido que hacerles alguna promesa?Yo me enorgullezco como representante estatal, y ahora como candidato a la alcald\u00eda, para ser claro, transparente y responsable ante las personas que me enviaron a esta posici\u00f3n. Y eso ha quedado muy claro en mi historial de votaciones. Eso ha sido muy claro al rechazar el poder y la autoridad cuando no est\u00e1 haciendo lo correcto para las comunidades a las que sirvo. Y debo decirles que en esta campa\u00f1a para la alcald\u00eda hemos tenido m\u00e1s donantes individuales de base que cualquier otra persona en esta contienda, incluido el alcalde. As\u00ed que estos son habitantes de Chicago de toda la ciudad que quieren ver un cambio, que est\u00e1n rogando por un nuevo liderazgo. Y estamos muy entusiasmados con eso.\u00a0Veremos algunos respaldos, creo que tan pronto como esta semana, en realidad, en ciertos funcionarios electos que respaldar\u00e1n nuestra campa\u00f1a, y luego tambi\u00e9n en otros grupos a medida que avanzan en su proceso. Pero yo creo que mi trayectoria en la Asamblea General, y la gente que me ha apoyado en este espacio, he sido muy claro, verdad. As\u00ed que siempre obtuve el respaldo y el apoyo de personas como el Sierra Club, y personas como el Consejo Ambiental de Illinois, as\u00ed como grupos de base en el terreno, como el Centro de Trabajadores por la Justicia Racial. Y en ese tipo de grupos con los que he podido trabajar para hacer las cosas.Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?Esa es una gran pregunta. Y es lamentable que tengas que preguntar eso. Hemos visto a personas cooptar movimientos y lenguaje y decir ciertas cosas, y luego simplemente llegar al cargo y hacer algo completamente diferente.\u00a0Como comenc\u00e9 esta conversaci\u00f3n, cuando digo hijo de Chicago, de aqu\u00ed, nacido aqu\u00ed, criado aqu\u00ed, morir\u00e9 aqu\u00ed. Este es mi hogar. Y no me voy a ninguna parte. Entonces, para m\u00ed, es importante rendir cuentas, no solo a las personas que represento, sino que estos son mis amigos, estos son mis vecinos. Estas son personas que son parte de mi pueblo en mi comunidad. Y no puedo decir una cosa hoy, y luego pasar a otra, y luego regresar y decir, denme la bienvenida con los brazos abiertos. Simplemente no es como yo opero.\u00a0As\u00ed que estar\u00e9 muy abierto y dispuesto a regresar y comunicarme con la gente. \u00bfEstoy haciendo lo que dije que har\u00eda? \u00bfEstoy manteniendo las promesas que hice cuando te ped\u00ed este trabajo? Esta es una entrevista de trabajo. Y es agresivo. Pero para m\u00ed es muy importante que la gente sepa claramente qui\u00e9n soy."

  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Brandon Johnson",
  "text": "El oto\u00f1o pasado, Brandon Johnson, el comisionado del condado de Cook ingres\u00f3 en la contienda por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago del 2023. Su campa\u00f1a progresista esta centrada en la creaci\u00f3n de coaliciones a trav\u00e9s de diferentes grupos raciales.Johnson ha obtenido el respaldo de pol\u00edticos como Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) y Delia Ramirez (IL-4) que son miembros de la C\u00e1mara de Representantes; el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago, SEIU Healthcare, el Sindicato de Maestros Universitarios del Condado de Cook y la Federaci\u00f3n de Maestros de Illinois. Tiene $1.8 millones disponibles.\u201cEstoy en la posici\u00f3n de ser el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago porque el movimiento est\u00e1 siendo escuchado y yo soy un reflejo de ese movimiento\u201d, dijo Johnson.\u00a0El 3 de enero, Johnson, que vive en el vecindario de Austin con su esposa e hijos, invit\u00f3 a miembros de The TRiiBE a principle barbers una barber\u00eda en North Lawndale. Despu\u00e9s de un r\u00e1pido corte de cabello por su amigo Bobby Price, habl\u00f3 sobre su visi\u00f3n para Chicago.A lo largo de nuestra entrevista, Johnson enfatiz\u00f3 la necesidad de primero invertir en la gente. Aboga por escuelas comunitarias, oportunidades de empleo, acceso a viviendas econ\u00f3micas, la financiaci\u00f3n de programas de verano para j\u00f3venes y una oficina de prevenci\u00f3n de violencia de armas.Reiter\u00f3 su compromiso a redirigir fondos de la polic\u00eda y las c\u00e1rceles hac\u00eda los servicios p\u00fablicos. Este fue uno de sus compromisos que lider\u00f3 como comisionado en el 2020.\u201cUno prioriza debido en los valores que uno tiene\u201d, dijo Johnson. \u201cCreo en nuestra gente. Amo a nuestra gente, y todo lo que quiero para mis hijes, lo quiero para todos les ni\u00f1es de la ciudad de Chicago, y quiero que los padres tengan la oportunidad de proveer lo mismo a sus hijes\u201d.Johnson fue maestro de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago en la Academia Jenner en el vecindario de Cabrini Green. Como organizador del Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago (CTU), form\u00f3 parte de la huelga de maestros del 2012 y se uni\u00f3 con organizadores comunitarios que compart\u00edan la visi\u00f3n social progresista del sindicato. Muchos, al igual que \u00e9l, ahora son funcionarios electos como la representante estatal Lakesia Collins (9th) y consejales Jeanette Taylor (20th), Byron Sigcho-L\u00f3pez (25th) y Carlos Ram\u00edrez-Rosa (35th).Johnson se uni\u00f3 con Taylor en el 2015. Ambos se unieron con padres y miembros de la comunidad en una huelga de hambre de 34 d\u00edas exigiendo que la ciudad reabriera la escuela secundaria Walter H. Dyett de Washington Park. Los huelguistas de hambre salvaron la escuela. Con el nuevo nombre, Dyett High School for the Arts, su primera clase de la secundaria se gradu\u00f3 en el 2020.\u00a0El distrito de Johnson est\u00e1 rodeado por Austin en el lado este y los suburbios de Bellwood en el lado oeste. Le dijo a The TRiiBE que inicialmente no estaba tratando de ser un pol\u00edtico, pero se sinti\u00f3 obligado a hacerlo porque a los l\u00edderes electos los \u201cest\u00e1bamos presionando pero no reaccionaban, as\u00ed que tuvimos que vencerlos\u201d.\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Johnson como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad.The TRiiBE:\u00a0 Al crecer, \u00bfqu\u00e9 impacto su pol\u00edtica y perspectiva de la vida?Mis padres quienes son l\u00edderes y pastores ayudaron a moldear mi visi\u00f3n del mundo.\u00a0La forma m\u00e1s sencilla en que puedo articular esto es que no somos solo para nostros mismos, tenemos una responsabilidad con los dem\u00e1s y seremos m\u00e1s fuertes si trabajamos colectivamente. Poder ver por el projimo y tambi\u00e9n reconocer sus intereses y necesidades es parte de reconocer que somos parte de algo m\u00e1s grande que nosotros mismos y tenemos que asumir responsabilidad a ese llamado. Eso es lo que molde\u00f3 mi visi\u00f3n del mundo. As\u00ed es como he liderado como esposo, padre, maestro, organizador y como comisionado del condado, y cu\u00e1les son mis intenciones como alcalde de Chicago.Ser\u00edas el primer alcalde viviendo en el West Side, el lado oeste de la ciudad. \u00bfC\u00f3mo ha moldeado sus puntos de vista el vivir y trabajar en Austin?La din\u00e1mica en el West Side, oeste de Chicago, particularmente Austin, es la parte de la ciudad Negra m\u00e1s grande dentro de la ciudad de Chicago. Es un lugar hermoso. Tiene una tremenda rica historia. Muchos de nuestros parientes y miembros de la familia y Negros en general, durante esa segunda migraci\u00f3n, se instalaron en el West Side, oeste de Chicago.Tambi\u00e9n es el lugar que visit\u00f3 el Dr. King. Estamos en el Norte de Lawndale. Entonces, aqu\u00ed es donde el Dr. King quer\u00eda asegurarse de estar conectado con las personas que describi\u00f3 como las personas m\u00e1s reales del mundo. As\u00ed es el West Side, oeste de Chicago. Es un lugar muy aut\u00e9ntico. La expresi\u00f3n completa de lo que es ser Negro en esta ciudad est\u00e1 en el West Side, oeste de Chicago, donde la gente es trabajadora. Ya sabes, gente de clase media, l\u00edderes pol\u00edticos. Tienes artistas. Entonces tienes a todos, desde Dorothy Tucker hasta Robert Townsend.El West Side, oeste de Chicago ciertamente ha sido un lugar donde el poder pol\u00edtico Negro y la existencia Negra han encontrado su riqueza en una variedad de disciplinas. Y es el lugar donde, de nuevo, la gente que trabaja todos los d\u00edas viene solo para poder experimentar lo que es justo, pero que, hasta cierto punto, es simplemente relajante.La violencia armada es un problema en Chicago. En su sitio de web, usted dice que es el mayor problema de la ciudad y se compromete a tomar medidas preventivas para abordar la violencia armada. \u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 su administraci\u00f3n en la seguridad?Los estudios de investigaci\u00f3n han indicado que el empleo juvenil reduce la violencia. Y si lo hace. Lo m\u00e1s importante que podemos hacer para reducir la violencia es contratar a j\u00f3venes y darles oportunidades que han faltado en nuestro espacio pol\u00edtico durante demasiado tiempo. Simplemente no hemos hecho lo suficiente.No podemos simplemente seguir parchando el problema. Es por eso que pido un programa de contrataci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes muy s\u00f3lido que brinde el tipo de oportunidades y el prop\u00f3sito que los j\u00f3venes necesitan. Lo segundo es el lanzamiento de una oficina de violencia de armas y prevenci\u00f3n de la violencia para que pongamos todas las soluciones t\u00e1cticas que saquen las armas de la calle.Lo tercero es que Chicago est\u00e1 bajo un trauma enorme. Si no estamos tratando de sanar ese trauma y solo estamos haciendo cosas que lo exacerban a\u00fan m\u00e1s, entonces no estamos siendo muy honestos acerca de nuestro deseo de ver la transformaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Chicago. Eso requiere, de nuevo, alguien que crea en los alojamientos p\u00fablicos. Y entonces reabrir nuestras cl\u00ednicas de salud, que muchos organizadores, organizadores Negros, particularmente en la ciudad de Chicago, han estado presionando para eso. Yo voy a responder a eso. La ordenanza The Treatment Not Truma, Tratamiento No Trauma, est\u00e1 patrocinada por el concejal del Distrito 33 [Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez]. Tenemos muchos organizadores Negros en la ciudad que han estado presionando por eso. Voy a responder a eso positivamente.Como ha de saber, la primavera pasada, la alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot extendi\u00f3 el toque de queda juvenil en toda la ciudad despu\u00e9s del tiroteo de un joven de 16 a\u00f1os en Millennium Park, a pesar de que los cr\u00edticos dijeron que afectar\u00ed desproporcionadamente a los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latine. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS? \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas o pol\u00edticas hay que redactar?Sabemos que las escuelas pueden ser lugares centrales donde la comunidad se puede reunir e organizar. La segunda cosa es que tenemos parques incre\u00edbles a los cuales no se ha invertido para que sean lugares para j\u00f3venes. Empecemos por ah\u00ed. Mis hijos asistieron a Garfield Park durante el verano. El programa de verano termina a la una. Gracias a Dios por Memaw; mi suegra y por su ayuda. De lo contrario, el horario del programa no funcionar\u00eda para mi familia.Entonces, la iniciativa, seria no solo expandir los espacios comunitarios dentro de nuestro sistema de escuelas p\u00fablicas, pero tambi\u00e9n expander los servicios para j\u00f3venes en el distrito de parques.\u00a0Todas esas cosas son importantes. Voy a invertir en esas cosas. Pero tambi\u00e9n se trata de garantizar que los j\u00f3venes tengan un sentido de prop\u00f3sito y sepan que alguien los ama y se preocupa por ellos. Como alcalde de Chicago, especialmente como alguien que ha ense\u00f1ado en escuelas p\u00fablicas, s\u00e9 identificar la mirada de desesperaci\u00f3n.\u00a0Si los j\u00f3venes est\u00e1n preparados y dispuestos a participar en la programaci\u00f3n, y est\u00e1n dispuestos a trabajar, habr\u00e1 un espacio para ellos. Vamos a encontrar los recursos para financiarlo. Para que no sea solo un lugar para que los j\u00f3venes lo est\u00e9n pasandola bien. Es un lugar donde est\u00e1n contribuyendo. Porque lo mejor que podr\u00edas hacer por cualquier ser humano es ayudarlo a encontrar su prop\u00f3sito. Y como alcalde de Chicago, har\u00e9 eso.Usted present\u00f3 una resoluci\u00f3n no vinculante que la Junta del Condado de Cook aprob\u00f3 en el verano de 2020 que apoy\u00f3 la redirecci\u00f3n de \"fondos de la vigilancia y el encarcelamiento a servicios p\u00fablicos no administrados por las fuerzas del orden que promuevan la salud y la seguridad de la comunidad de manera equitativa\". \u00bfTodav\u00eda apoya la reasignaci\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares fuera de la polic\u00eda?La adicci\u00f3n que tiene esta ciudad, y francamente este pa\u00eds, a las c\u00e1rceles y el encarcelamiento ha demostrado ser problem\u00e1tica. \u00bfDe verdad estamos m\u00e1s seguros? \u00bfSe sienten seguras las personas caminando en nuestras comunidades? Mi hijo de 15 a\u00f1os, que estudia en la secundaria Kenwood, en su tercera semana en la escuela, uno de los estudiantes sale a almorzar y lo asesinan, y estamos gastando $5 millones al d\u00eda [en vigilancia].Estamos hablando de un presupuesto de $ 3 mil millones. Y la tasa de aprobaci\u00f3n para resolver cr\u00edmenes es abismal. La gente todav\u00eda no tiene una conexi\u00f3n s\u00f3lida y confiable entre las fuerzas del orden p\u00fablico y la comunidad. Gastamos m\u00e1s dinero en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos que en viviendas y prevenci\u00f3n de la violencia. Aqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el \u00edmpetu detr\u00e1s de esto. Como alcalde de Chicago, me dedico a hacer lo que funciona.Si decimos que tenemos que llegar hasta la ra\u00edz de lo que ha causado dolor y ha afectado a las comunidades en las que no se ha invertido por generaciones, entonces hag\u00e1moslo. El objetivo de la resoluci\u00f3n del 2020 era motivarnos a hacer lo que funciona y alejarnos de estos malos h\u00e1bitos que solo exacerban las condiciones en las que decimos que estamos tratando de transformarnos y cambiar.Hagamos lo que hacen las comunidades seguras. Ellos financian completamente sus escuelas. Mire Oak Park, dos distritos escolares totalmente financiados en una ciudad. Tienen bibliotecas que permanecen abiertas hasta las nueve de la noche con programas. Tienen parques que son totalmente apoydados. Aman tanto a sus hijes que brindan oportunidades para que les ni\u00f1es puedan vivir su ni\u00f1ez como debe de ser. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es diferente para aquellos de nosotros que vivimos en Chicago? No deber\u00eda ser asi, y como alcalde de Chicago, vamos a transformar eso.Vamos a dejar de depender de estos sistemas antiguos que contin\u00faan da\u00f1ando y aterrorizando a nuestras comunidades. Cuando sabemos que las cosas que funcionan requieren que amemos a nuestres hijes, que amemos a las personas que los cr\u00edan e invirtamos en elles. Claramente, mi posici\u00f3n sigue siendo la misma. Amo a nuestra gente lo suficiente como para invertir en elles y lo har\u00e9 como alcalde de Chicago.La pregunta principal que la gente quiere saber y tener una respuesta clara es sobre el presupuesto de CPD. \u00bfEs algo que aumentara o disminuir\u00eda con usted como alcalde?El presupuesto policial actual es de casi $3 mil millones y nuestras comunidades no son m\u00e1s seguras. No podemos seguir por un camino que ha demostrado que obviamente no funciona.Se trata de enfocarnos en d\u00f3nde deben de estar nuestras prioridades. Puedo decir enf\u00e1ticamente, y basado en el historial, que mis prioridades ser\u00e1n la educaci\u00f3n, la vivienda economica, la salud mental, el trabajo, el transporte y nuestros parques. Ah\u00ed es donde van a estar nuestras prioridades. Mire, vamos a tener que examinar todos los aspectos del presupuesto de la ciudad, pero este, en particular, ha demostrado que el rendimiento que se\u00a0 dijo que obtendr\u00edamos como resultado de estas inversiones no se ha dado como resultado.No hay regreso a esa supuesta inversi\u00f3n. No me voy a comprometer a continuar con cosas del presupuesto que hayan demostrado que han fallado a nuestra gente y a nuestras comunidades. Yo me he he comprometido a la justicia para las vidas de Negras, un presupuesto para las vidas Negras, y eso no cambiara cuando sea alcalde de Chicago. Tenemos que invertir en las \u00e1reas en las que sabemos que funcionan. En este momento, la forma en que se sit\u00faa este presupuesto, particularmente en torno a la vigilancia, no ha funcionado.\u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela? Muchos tienen que ir a otros vecindarios de la ciudad porque sus escuelas no tienen los recursos que necesitan para prosperar academicamente.Ser\u00e9 el primer alcalde en la historia reciente que realmente cree en la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica porque no solo soy un producto de las escuelas p\u00fablicas, mis hijes son estudiantes de las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago. Entonces, cuando hablamos de la din\u00e1mica dentro de la comunidad, mi esposa y yo vivimos en Austin, y llevamos a nuestros hijes de ocho y diez a\u00f1os quienes est\u00e1n en tercer y quinto grado, hasta el noroeste en Portage Park que toma de 20 a 25 minutos para llegar.Nuestro hije de 15 a\u00f1os [es] un estudiante del primer a\u00f1o de secundaria en la escuela Kenwood. As\u00ed que lo llevamos al sur lo cual toma entre 25 a 30 para llegar, principalmente porque no tenemos una escuela en Austin que apoye completamente las artes. Entonces tuvimos que salir de nuestra comunidad para que elles tengan la oportunidad de tomar clases de orquesta, deporte y enfermeras en la escuela. Estas no son cosas inalcanzables.\u00a0Lo primero que voy a impulsar es algo llamado Escuelas Comunitarias Sostenibles. Es una pol\u00edtica que hemos estado promoviendo a trav\u00e9s del trabajo de las organizaciones comunitarias y laborales, donde los trabajadores y la comunidad se unen para brindar el tipo de comunidades escolares enriquecidas o totalmente apoyadas que se necesitan.\u00a0\u00a0Lo segundo, por supuesto, es asegurarnos de tener un plan para ayudar a transformar nuestras escuelas secundarias porque, como mencionaron, es importante tener en cuenta que la baja de estudiantes que se inscriben en ciertas escuelas que estamos viendo es por dise\u00f1o.Esto no es algo que ocurri\u00f3 por casualidad. Hemos tenido administraci\u00f3n tras administraci\u00f3n en esta ciudad que ha interrumpido la vivienda p\u00fablica. Cerraron las escuelas p\u00fablicas y eliminaron el trabajo de los empleados p\u00fablicos, de lo que se beneficiaban en particular la gente Negra. Por lo tanto, no deber\u00eda sorprendernos que la cantidad de estudiantes y familias que perdimos durante el cierre de las escuelas sea casi equivalente a la cantidad necesaria para mantener un barrio Negro.\u00bfSera tan simple como solo invertir en escuelas suficientemente para solucionar el problema de la disminuci\u00f3n de estudiantes que se matr\u00edculan en las escuelas? \u00bfQu\u00e9 otras cosas a largo plazo se necesitan? Usted mencion\u00f3 las escuelas comunitarias sostenibles y el segundo punto es un plan para transformar las escuelas secundarias. \u00bfQu\u00e9 otras cosas propone fuera de eso?Lo mejor que puede hacer por la educaci\u00f3n y el \u00e9xito acad\u00e9mico de un ni\u00f1o es asegurarme de que sus padres tengan formularios W-2. Sin embargo, tenemos que tener un compromiso con la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y la financiaci\u00f3n.Si les ni\u00f1es vienen a la escuela todos los d\u00edas sin hogar, hambrientos y enfermos, no est\u00e1n pensando en analizar conclusiones, el enfoque del autor, equilibrar ecuaciones o la tabla peri\u00f3dica.\u00a0Como alcalde de Chicago, mi prioridad principal es asegurarme de que las personas que no tengan una base de seguridad econ\u00f3mica tengan acceso a la seguridad econ\u00f3mica. Todo lo dem\u00e1s se convierte no solo en un estr\u00e9s para esa familia en particular. Se convierte en un estr\u00e9s para la comunidad y se convierte en un estr\u00e9s para el gobierno. Para aliviar ese estr\u00e9s, tenemos que brindar oportunidades. Lo m\u00e1s importante que tenemos que hacer es crear oportunidades para las personas que tienen que ir a trabajar todos los d\u00edas, tener trabajos con salarios decentes, acceso a seguro m\u00e9dico y que los traten con dignidad y respeto en sus trabajos.A partir del 2025, Chicago tendr\u00e1 una junta escolar electa. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo trabajar\u00e1 para apoyar este esfuerzo? \u00bfY a qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00eda para la junta h\u00edbrida?Estoy muy emocionado de que en medio de un pa\u00eds donde la democracia est\u00e1 siendo restringida, en realidad la estamos expandiendo en Chicago. La alcaldesa de Chicago [la alcaldesa Lori Lightfoot] prometi\u00f3 eso, y luego se hecho para atras y fue en contra de una de sus promesas de campa\u00f1a. As\u00ed que quiero enfocarme un poco en sus acciones, porque en realidad lo que hizo es una falta de respeto incre\u00edble debido al trabajo, el tiempo, el esfuerzo y los sacrificios que la gente hizo para tener ese tipo de responsabilidad democr\u00e1tica.Hemos perdido escuelas y hemos perdido educadores Negros, y el plan de estudios se ha reducido en torno al control de la alcaldeza. El control de la alcaldeza no ha sido solamente un fracaso en particular para la gente Negra, pero tambi\u00e9n para el sistema educativo. Esto es lo que har\u00e9 en el 2024 porque no tendremos la junta totalmente electa hasta el 2026.Voy a ir a la comunidad y voy a ir al Concejo Municipal para asegurarme de que la representaci\u00f3n que tenemos para esas 11 posiciones refleje los valores que desde el inicio realmente promovieron la creaci\u00f3n de la junta escolar representativa electa. Tiene que ser gente que realmente crea en los alojamientos p\u00fablicos.\u00a0Tienen que creer que un presupuesto que lleve en mente las necesidades de la gente. Tienen que creer que la fuerza de docente y toda la fuerza educativa, ya sea un asistente de maestro, un maestro, una enfermera o un conserje, que los trabajadores deben ser apoyados. Estos valores son la base para cualquier persona que vaya a estar en la junta escolar que vaya a pasar por un proceso de investigaci\u00f3n con la comunidad y el Concejo Municipal, y tienen que defender esos tres principios. Cualquier cosa menos que esto ser\u00eda irresponsable. Simplemente seguira m\u00e1s de lo mismo.\u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus planes para reabrir las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental que actualmente estan cerradas?Estoy trabajando con defensores de la salud mental. Parte de mi criterio tiene que ser d\u00f3nde la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita es peor. Miremos vecindarios como Englewood, North Lawndale, Garfield Park o Roseland, donde la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita se han descrito en ciertas partes de la ciudad como [comparables a] pa\u00edses en desarrollo. Esta es una de las ciudades m\u00e1s ricas del mundo, y tenemos partes de la ciudad que reflejan las condiciones de naciones en desarrollo.Los defensores que entienden y conocen este trabajo ayudar\u00e1n a guiar c\u00f3mo reabrir y c\u00f3mo clasificar estos espacios. Estoy incre\u00edblemente impresionado con los j\u00f3venes organizadores Negros que han liderado esto. No solo tendr\u00e1n un asiento en la mesa del quinto piso, pero van a poder ayudar a implementar los cambios. Lo que estoy diciendo es que [como m\u00ednimo], la base tiene que ser la violencia y la pobreza per c\u00e1pita. Donde esas dos din\u00e1micas se cruzan, debemos comenzar a construir desde all\u00ed. Voy a apoyarme en los expertos y los organizadores para ayudar a guiar eso en mi administraci\u00f3n.\u00bfQu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas o iniciativas promulgar\u00e1 para ayudar a los inquilinos y propietarios de viviendas a evitar el desplazamiento? Y tambi\u00e9n, \u00bfqu\u00e9 har\u00e1 para apoyar a las personas sin hogar?Nadie deber\u00eda ser demasiado pobre para poder vivir en la ciudad de Chicago. Nadie. Entonces, parte de lo que tenemos que hacer es asegurarnos de que el impuesto a la transferencia de bienes ra\u00edces ser revise para descubrir c\u00f3mo asignar d\u00f3lares a esas familias sin vivienda. Lo segundo que tenemos que hacer es que tenemos que tener un compromiso real hacia la viviendas p\u00fablicas. Por eso es que estoy a favor de no construir nada en terrenos que alguna vez fueron viviendas p\u00fablicas.La tercera cosa es el tipo de inversiones que necesitamos hacer en nuestras comunidades, particularmente en torno a los ingresos. Eso es algo en lo que como alcalde de Chicago me concentrar\u00e9 mucho, en ingresos progresivos para poder hacer el tipo de inversiones para abordar la inseguridad econ\u00f3mica que se est\u00e1 presentando, particularmente en casos de las viviendas p\u00fablicas.Menciono el Impuesto de Transmisiones Patrimoniales. \u00bfEso significa que apoyas Bring Chicago Home, la iniciativa llamada Regresar Chicago a Casa?S\u00ed, lo apoyo.Usted mencion\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente a los propietarios de viviendas, pero muchos de nuestros lectores son inquilinos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 tipo de apoyo ve para ayudar a las personas a poder pagar la renta?Si no estamos brindando oportunidades econ\u00f3micas reales para que la gente realmente consiga trabajo y ofrezca trabajos bien pagados, ya sea que la renta sea de $ 675 o\u00a0$1,200 d\u00f3lares al mes, si no tiene una oportunidad econ\u00f3mica real para tener un buen trabajo decente bien pagado, vamos a seguir perdiendo talento, especialmente dentro de nuestra comunidad.Eso desde crear oportunidades en el espacio p\u00fablico en el que tendr\u00e9 jurisdicci\u00f3n para desafiar a nuestras corporaciones para incentivarlas a contratar a nuestra gente. Entonces, una de las cosas que estamos impulsando es que para nuestras corporaciones m\u00e1s grandes, hay formas en las que podemos proporcionar incentivos fiscales y aumentar los ingresos y los incentivos fiscales. Contratar a nuestra gente en estas grandes corporaciones podr\u00eda aliviar algunas de las cargas fiscales de las que algunas de estas corporaciones quieren alg\u00fan alivio. Al mismo tiempo, si las corporaciones no est\u00e1n priorizando a nuestra gente, entonces tendran que contribuir de otras formas si no estan contratando a nuestra gente.\u00a0Francamente, para muchas de estas iniciativas vamos a necesitar la intervenci\u00f3n de Springfield, de las cuales muchas de esas cosas que se he propuesto como organizador, las apoyare mucho. Va a requerir relaciones, especialmente en torno a c\u00f3mo vemos el costo de la renta, y c\u00f3mo nos aseguramos de que la renta no supere los ingresos en los que muchos de nuestros j\u00f3venes profesionales Negros en particular est\u00e1n atrapados. Entiendo muy bien que requiere alguna intervenci\u00f3n del estado para asegurarnos de que ese alivio est\u00e9 disponible.Ha recibido importantes respaldos financieros de varios sindicatos nacionales y locales, incluida la Federaci\u00f3n Estadounidense de Maestros, el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago, SEIU Healthcare y United Working Families. \u00bfDe qu\u00e9 manera asume usted su responsabilidad ante los sindicatos que lo respaldan? \u00bfY cu\u00e1l es su relaci\u00f3n con esos grupos?Asumo mi responsabilidad ante todas las personas a las que representar\u00e9. Asumo mi responsabilidad ante los trabajadores, ante aquellos que luchan por existir en la clase media, y ante aquellas familias que est\u00e1n pasando por la pobreza. Asumo mi responsabilidad ante aquellas familias que han experimentado un poco de seguridad econ\u00f3mica pero a\u00fan no se sienten seguros.Mi relaci\u00f3n con el movimiento laboral est\u00e1 profundamente ligada a una larga historia en este pa\u00eds donde los derechos civiles y los derechos laborales han trabajado mano a mano para finalmente traer justicia econ\u00f3mica a la gente Negra. As\u00ed que esa es mi relaci\u00f3n. Como docente de estudios sociales, soy consciente de ello. Soy consciente de eso. Fui criado por alguien que era parte del movimiento obrero. Mi padre era un empleado p\u00fablico que formaba parte del Sindicato de Trabajadores de AFSCME. Entonces, hay una larga historia de trabajadores Negros atados al movimiento laboral que tambi\u00e9n luchaban por los derechos civiles en Chicago, y yo soy parte de esa historia.Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?La rendici\u00f3n de cuentas es importante. Mira, como te dije, soy uno de 10 [hijos]. As\u00ed que he aprendido a ser responsable de mis hermanos menores, pero tambi\u00e9n hacia mis hermanos mayores. La mejor manera en que el movimiento puede asegurarse de que asuma mis responsabilidades es manteniendose conectado con la administraci\u00f3n. No tienen que esperar a que mi administraci\u00f3n convoque una reuni\u00f3n comunitaria o una reuni\u00f3n familiar.\u00a0\u00a0Vamos a aprobar uno de los presupuestos m\u00e1s dram\u00e1ticos para el tercer a\u00f1o de mi administraci\u00f3n, debido a los desaf\u00edos estructurales que las administraciones anteriores han ignorado. Voy a necesitar que nuestra familia me ayude a hacer eso. Espero que nuestra familia me acompa\u00f1e y tambi\u00e9n mire lo que he hecho hasta ahora.No hay otro candidato que arm\u00f3 un presupuesto completo en torno a las necesidades de la gente Negra. No s\u00e9 si alguien ha hecho eso en todo el pa\u00eds. Soy el \u00fanico candidato en esta contienda que pidi\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente invertir en cosas que funcionan y no en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos. Nadie tuvo que entrar y golpear mi puerta para convencerme de hacer lo que he prometido hacer.\u00a0Habr\u00e1 fuerzas por ah\u00ed tratando de interrumpir eso y separarnos unos de otros. Esas fuerzas han estado tratando de hacer eso durante cu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os en este pa\u00eds, separando a la gente Negra de nuestros intereses. Soy docente de estudios sociales, tengo claro c\u00f3mo se ve eso. Quiero unir a la familia. Por eso me postulo para alcalde de Chicago, reunamos a la familia. Cuando se ponga dif\u00edcil, hay que estar unidos y construir juntos. La administraci\u00f3n que voy a dirigir como alcalde de Chicago tiene que ver con construir puentes, no cerrar puentes.\u00a0No hay otro candidato que arm\u00f3 un presupuesto completo en torno a la gente Negra de Chicago. No s\u00e9 si alguien ha hecho eso en todo el pa\u00eds. Soy el \u00fanico candidato en esta contienda que pidi\u00f3 espec\u00edficamente invertir en cosas que funcionan y no en c\u00e1rceles y encarcelamientos. Nadie tuvo que entrar y golpear mi puerta para convencerme de hacer lo que he prometido hacer."

  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Ald. Roderick Sawyer",
  "text": "El Concejal Roderick Sawyer (sexto distrito) no es ajeno a la pol\u00edtica de Chicago. Se ha desempe\u00f1ado en el Concejo Municipal desde 2011, cuando derrot\u00f3 a Freddrenna Lyle, quien fue nombrada concejal por el entonces alcalde Richard M. Daley en 1998.\u00a0Sawyer naci\u00f3 y se cri\u00f3, y a\u00fan reside, en Park Manor, uno de los vecindarios que representa en el Concejo Municipal, al igual que su padre. Al igual que Daley, Sawyer es hijo de un exalcalde de Chicago.\u00a0Tras la muerte de Harold Washington, Concejal Eugene Sawyer el padre de Sawyer, fue elegido por un grupo de concejales blancos para ser alcalde en vez de el aliado de Washington, Timothy Evans. Eugene Sawyer sirvi\u00f3 durante dos a\u00f1os hasta que fue derrotado por Daley en las elecciones para alcalde del 1989. Daley mantuvo el poder durante casi tres d\u00e9cadas, m\u00e1s que cualquier otro alcalde de Chicago. Sawyer explic\u00f3 que sigue los pasos de su padre no por legado familiar, sino como servidor p\u00fablico.\u00a0\u201cNo me postulo para alcalde por \u00e9l. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo\u201d, dijo.\u00a0Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a alcalde del 2023, Sawyer invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 5 de enero al restaurante Oooh Wee It Is, el cual es un negocio dirigido por personas Negras en Chatham conocido por su comida reconfortante sure\u00f1a.\u00a0Actualmente, Sawyer se desempe\u00f1a como presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Salud y Relaciones Humanas del Concejo Municipal. Adem\u00e1s, fue presidente del Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus y copresidente del Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0Dijo que su historial en el Concejo Municipal y el hecho de que se haya ganado el apoyo y la confianza de sus colegas en la c\u00e1mara prueban que est\u00e1 preparado para ser el pr\u00f3ximo alcalde de Chicago.\u00a0\u201cHe presentado y se ha aprob\u00f3 legislaci\u00f3nes innovadoras en el Concejo Municipal, por lo que tengo una capacidad comprobada para hacer las cosas\u201d, dijo Sawyer.\u00a0Durante su mandato en el Concejo Municipal, ha defendido temas como la ordenanza Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) que estableci\u00f3 una junta civil electa de residentes de Chicago para supervisar el Departamento de Polic\u00eda de Chicago (CPD), la lucha por un salario m\u00ednimo de $15, el impulso para una junta escolar representativa electa y la ordenanza de GoodKids Madcity\u2019s Peace Book.Tambi\u00e9n vot\u00f3 a favor de medidas impopulares, incluyendo el presupuesto del 2011 de Emanuel, que se aprob\u00f3 por unanimidad y cerr\u00f3 seis de las 12 instalaciones de salud mental de la ciudad, y una medida del 2017 para adquirir una propiedad en West Garfield Park para una academia de polic\u00eda, que se aprob\u00f3 48 a 1.Durante nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, Sawyer habl\u00f3 sobre sus planes para abordar la violencia, la salud mental, la juventud, la vivienda asequible, las reparaciones para los habitantes Negros de Chicago y m\u00e1s.\u00a0No est\u00e1 llamando a aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto del CPD. En cambio, de acuerdo con su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, quiere reclutar m\u00e1s polic\u00edas, reparar el sistema de respuesta de emergencia de la ciudad, mejorar el bienestar de los oficiales, invertir en capacitaci\u00f3n policial integral y m\u00e1s. Adem\u00e1s, apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma, quiere abordar las causas profundas de la violencia y llama a revitalizar los vecindarios que han sufrido desinversi\u00f3n durante d\u00e9cadas.Como concejal, su vot\u00f3 estaba alineado con el del alcalde Rahm Emanuel el 100 por ciento del tiempo desde abril del 2017 hasta noviembre del 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Sawyer como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE:\u00a0 \u00bfC\u00f3mo impact\u00f3 y molde\u00f3 el crecer en Park Manor su pol\u00edtica?Concejal Roderick Sawyer: Crecer en Park Manor y todav\u00eda seguir viviendo aqu\u00ed habla muy bien del vecindario y la gente de aqu\u00ed. Cuando era ni\u00f1o, lo vi en su mejor momento. He visto a la comunidad de Park Manor luchar, y pasar por tiempos dif\u00edciles. Nunca cambi\u00f3 mi decision de querer quedarme aqu\u00ed y tratar de mejorar lo que hay aqu\u00ed.Soy muy firme sobre de d\u00f3nde vengo. Paso una cantidad excesiva de tiempo en mi vecindario porque siento mucho por la gente de aqu\u00ed. Ellos me formaron en lo que ahora soy. Entonces, como abogado, como persona de negocios y como residente, es abrumador el amor que recibo de mis vecinos de Park Manor, mis vecinos de Chatham, porque todos hemos superado esa lucha. Todos \u00e9ramos ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os juntos, traviesos, jug\u00e1bamos en los callejones y and\u00e1bamos en bicicleta por la zona. As\u00ed que para m\u00ed quedarme aqu\u00ed y elegir estar aqu\u00ed no es un testamento para m\u00ed, pero es un testamento para los que me rodean. Eso es extremadamente importante.Eres hijo del segundo alcalde Negro de Chicago, Eugene Sawyer.S\u00ed.Cuando el Concejo Municipal estaba seleccionando un sucesor despu\u00e9s del fallecimiento de Harold Washington, exist\u00eda la preocupaci\u00f3n de que nombrar a su padre para el puesto significar\u00eda un regreso a las pol\u00edticas anteriores. Adem\u00e1s, la mayor parte del apoyo que recibi\u00f3 de la c\u00e1mara provino de concejales blancos que obstru\u00edan al entonces alcalde Harold Washington y su agenda. Tambi\u00e9n hubo algunas acusaciones de algunos en la comunidad que acusaron a su padre de venderse a pol\u00edticos blancos.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 ingreso a la contienda? \u00bfEs para seguir los pasos de su padre? \u00bfQu\u00e9 aprendio de su padre sobre el servicio p\u00fablico?Bueno, hagamos algunas correcciones. Primero, mi padre fue elegido porque era el mejor candidato para ese puesto. Fue un momento problem\u00e1tico despu\u00e9s de la muerte de nuestro amigo Harold Washington.Mi padre fue presidente del Comit\u00e9 de Reglas y presidente pro tempore. Eso significaba que \u00e9l dirig\u00eda el Comit\u00e9 de Reglas, y cuando Harold sali\u00f3, asumi\u00f3 el mando. Esa fue una enorme cantidad de responsabilidad dada a mi padre. Nadie ha ocupado nunca dos presidencias de comit\u00e9 al mismo tiempo adem\u00e1s de \u00e9l. As\u00ed que lo doy como testamento de confianza del alcalde a mi padre. El alcalde sab\u00eda que el trabajo se iba a hacer. Adem\u00e1s, cuando muri\u00f3 Harold, mi padre aprob\u00f3 todas las iniciativas que Harold trat\u00f3 de aprobar y no pudo debido a su prematura muerte. Incluso cosas que iban en contra de sus propios intereses personales.Mi padre era devoto de Harold Washington. As\u00ed que toda esa charla era una tonter\u00eda acerca de que \u00e9l estaba en deuda con los intereses de los blancos. Mi padre era un orgulloso hombre Negro de este vecindario [Park Manor] y Greensboro, Alabama. Una persona que estuvo all\u00ed protegiendo la casa de Martin Luther King mientras estaba en el estado de Alabama.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que todo ese ruido que hac\u00eda la gente en ese entonces era muy preocupante. Fue desalentador porque los intereses de mi padre eran sus residentes, la ciudad, Chicago y el Distrito 6.\u00a0Sin embargo, para responder a su \u00faltima pregunta, mi padre me ense\u00f1\u00f3 mucho sobre lo importante que es ser un buen administrador de su comunidad y lo importante que es el servicio p\u00fablico. Entonces en ese sentido, si, estoy siguiendo los pasos de mi padre, no como alcalde sino como servidor p\u00fablico aqu\u00ed en un \u00e1rea donde nac\u00ed y crec\u00ed, y por eso y lo que vi de \u00e9l, c\u00f3mo la gente lo ten\u00eda en alto estima porque ayudaba a los que estaban en este barrio. As\u00ed que quer\u00eda continuar ese mismo tipo de servicio. No me postulo para alcalde por mi padre. Me postulo para alcalde porque hay un problema y puedo ayudar a resolverlo.Le\u00ed que cree que el crimen es el problema m\u00e1s importante de nuestra ciudad. Sin embargo, si es elegido, dijo que primero despedir\u00eda al superintendente de polic\u00eda de CPD. David Marr\u00f3n. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 o por qu\u00e9 no?Creo que nuestro mayor problema es la ansiedad por el crimen. Eso significa que no importa d\u00f3nde vivas en la ciudad. Si sales, sientes que existe la posibilidad de que te pase algo. Esa es la ansiedad, y eso tiene un costo econ\u00f3mico.\u00a0Los que tienen medios y recursos no salen porque sienten esa ansiedad. Eso significa que no gastan dinero en restaurantes, bares, teatros, gimnasios, cervecer\u00edas, clubs de salud y todas las cosas en las que esperar\u00edamos que gastaran dinero [en].Cuando vi a David Brown en Dallas , me anim\u00f3. Pens\u00e9 que ser\u00eda un buen superintendente porque apoyaba a sus polic\u00edas en Dallas. Vi que era duro con el crimen y un tipo con fuerza. Desafortunadamente, no estamos recibiendo a ese mismo tipo aqu\u00ed ahora. Este no es el mismo David Brown.Si fuera elegido, aprovechar\u00eda esa oportunidad para usar la plataforma en la que trabaj\u00e9 durante siete a\u00f1os, Empowering Communities for Public Safety, o ECPS [ordenanza].Me enorgullece decir que fui el patrocinador principal de la ordenanza ECPS y ayud\u00e9 a llevarla a cabo. Entonces, elegiremos miembros de la comunidad para restablecer la confianza entre la comunidad y la polic\u00eda y, cuando lo hagamos, la gente se sentir\u00e1 m\u00e1s c\u00f3moda hablando con la polic\u00eda. Eso significa que le dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n a la polic\u00eda, lo que significa que podemos resolver m\u00e1s cr\u00edmenes, as\u00ed es como funciona. Es un efecto domin\u00f3.Soy un gran defensor de eso. Tambi\u00e9n usar\u00e9 esa misma plataforma para elegir un superintendente que tenga el respeto del departamento de polic\u00eda, de las bases, que haya pasado por el sistema, que comprenda lo que necesitamos para que los oficiales se concentren en su trabajo, lo cual es detener a la gente mala y atarlos para que tengan un juicio.\u00bfUsted piensa en aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto de CPD? \u00bfC\u00f3mo piensa que deber\u00eda asignarse el presupuesto policial?Debemos tener los recursos necesarios para responder a las llamadas de servicio. La Ciudad de Chicago est\u00e1 en un negocio de servicios. Eso es especialmente cierto para la polic\u00eda. La polic\u00eda es un servicio. Son servidores p\u00fablicos; te sirven y sirven a todos aqu\u00ed.Entonces, si no tenemos suficientes oficiales para responder a las llamadas y toma m\u00e1s de una hora responder a las llamadas, eso es un problema. Eso est\u00e1 aumentando esa misma ansiedad de la que habl\u00e9. As\u00ed que ahora me han robado, llamo a la polic\u00eda y no aparece nadie. Eso se siente como si nadie me estuviera protegiendo. Esa es esa ansiedad continua. As\u00ed que no me har\u00e1 sentir mejor si nadie aparece.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, esto es lo que estamos hablando de hacer para las llamadas no violentas, digamos, desafortunadamente, te robaron, pero est\u00e1s bien. No te hicieron da\u00f1o. Se llevaron tu billetera, bolso o auto. Puede llamar al 9-1-1, y podemos enviar a alguien para obtener un informe de usted, un oficial uniformado. Puede ser un oficial retirado que sabe c\u00f3mo tomar el informe y obtener descripciones de usted y transmitir esa informaci\u00f3n a aquellos en la calle que, con suerte, pueden detener a ese sospechoso o delincuente y llevarlos a juicio.\u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 en seguridad? Seg\u00fan lo que dijo, \u00bfeso significa que contratar\u00eda m\u00e1s polic\u00edas?Contratar\u00eda polic\u00edas cuando sea apropiado. Me asegurar\u00eda de que superemos el nivel de jubilaciones y deserciones. La gente se est\u00e1 yendo. Y aseg\u00farese de que no sea un enfoque de uno u otro. Creo en dotar a los oficiales del nivel adecuado. Tal vez sean oficiales jubilados o civiles que necesitamos contratar para conseguir a esos oficiales que necesitamos para salir a la calle.\u00a0Es posible que solo necesitemos reasignar algunas posiciones. Pero eso no significa que no debamos invertir en servicios de salud mental, oportunidades laborales, capacitaci\u00f3n laboral, abuso de drogas y sustancias, o adicci\u00f3n. No, es un enfoque de ambos y. Tenemos que invertir en todas esas cosas.\u00bfHay otras formas fuera de la polic\u00eda en las que invertir\u00eda en seguridad?Nuevamente, invertir en la respuesta del tratamiento de los servicios de salud mental para que, tal vez, alguien pueda reducir la intensidad de una situaci\u00f3n en lugar de arrestar a alguien. Podemos proporcionar servicios de adicci\u00f3n a las drogas a aquellos que son dependientes a ellas. Tenemos que invertir en ambas cosas. No es de hacer esto y no hacer aquello. Se deben hacer ambas cosas.En el 2020, propuso eliminar CPD de CPS en el Concejo Municipal. \u00bfHa cambiado su opini\u00f3n acerca de eso? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?Bueno, d\u00e9jame decir esto. Mi objetivo no era sacar a los polic\u00edas de las escuelas. Quer\u00eda iniciar una conversaci\u00f3n sobre lo que hacen los oficiales de polic\u00eda en ciertas escuelas y c\u00f3mo a veces tiene un efecto negativo en sus estudiantes. Me alegro de que haya funcionado como lo hizo porque las escuelas ahora toman una decisi\u00f3n. Pueden elegir si quieren oficiales en su escuela o no quieren oficiales, y es una elecci\u00f3n del LSC [Consejo Escolar Local] de la escuela. Estoy muy contento con la forma en que sali\u00f3.\u00a0La gente simplemente malinterpret\u00f3 mi objetivo. Mi objetivo era provocar una discusi\u00f3n, lo cual sucedi\u00f3. A veces tienes que hacer cosas audaces, y es por eso que necesitas un l\u00edder que no tenga miedo de tomar una decisi\u00f3n audaz. No tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n precipitada; Tom\u00e9 una decisi\u00f3n audaz.\u00a0Terminamos ahorrando algo de dinero. Ahorramos varios millones de d\u00f3lares para aquellas escuelas que eligieron no tener oficiales en su escuela y aquellas que mantuvieron oficiales en escuelas que estaban contentas con sus oficiales. Empoder\u00f3 a los representantes del LSC y a otros a tomar decisiones sobre el futuro de sus escuelas, lo cual me alegro mucho de poder haber hecho.Muchos de sus colegas votaron a favor de la propuesta del alcalde Lightfoot de extender y ampliar el toque de queda para los j\u00f3venes en toda la ciudad a pesar de que cr\u00edticos decian que afectar\u00eda desproporcionadamente a los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latine. Fue uno de los concejales negros que vot\u00f3 en contra. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS? \u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda estos planes?Est\u00e1bamos pensando en c\u00f3mo mantenerlos alejados, en lugar de relacionarnos con ellos y tenerlos en un espacio seguro donde puedan divertirse, y cuando llegue el momento de irse a casa, se ir\u00e1n a casa. Est\u00e1n cansados \u200b\u200by se la pasaron bien. Les proporcionamos algo bueno y los organizadores ganaron un poco de dinero. As\u00ed es como gan\u00e9 dinero cuando era ni\u00f1o. Hice fiestas. Yo era DJ, organizaba fiestas y estaba involucrado en eso.\u00a0As\u00ed que no veo eso en la juventud en este momento. Por eso est\u00e1n tan frustrados que no tienen d\u00f3nde desahogarse. Cuando eres joven, tienes mucha energ\u00eda reprimida que necesitas liberar, as\u00ed que eso es bailar y actuar chistoso por un momento. Necesit\u00e1bamos proporcionarles eso. Entonces se frustran y se van a comportar mal, y eso es lo que sucedi\u00f3 y eso es un fracaso de nuestra parte.Como concejal, usted vot\u00f3 para cerrar la mitad de las cl\u00ednicas de salud mental de la ciudad durante la administraci\u00f3n del entonces alcalde Rahm Emanuel. Sin embargo, en el sitio de web de su campa\u00f1a, dijo que apoya el tratamiento, no el trauma. Si apoya Tratamiento No Trauma, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 vot\u00f3 para cerrar esas cl\u00ednicas de salud mental?Cuando me eligieron, entr\u00e9 como presidente del comit\u00e9 de salud y relaciones humanas, y lo primero que hice fue visitar los centros de salud mental restantes. Estaban vac\u00edos.\u00a0\u00a0Apenas hab\u00eda pacientes de ning\u00fan nivel. Los visit\u00e9 a todos. Dijeron que nunca los visit\u00f3 ning\u00fan consejal. Los he visitado todos. Lo primero que hice fue mirarlos todos y ver cu\u00e1les eran los recursos y si estaban ocupados. Me pregunte, \u00bfNecesit\u00e1bamos proporcionar m\u00e1s recursos?Cuando hice esa votaci\u00f3n sobre los centros de salud mental, un par de a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s escrib\u00ed un art\u00edculo, y dije que si pod\u00eda retirar un voto, el \u00fanico voto que retirar\u00eda era el cierre del servicio de salud mental [las cl\u00ednicas]. Deber\u00edamos haber tomado m\u00e1s tiempo antes de hacer esa decisi\u00f3n.No creo que no deber\u00edan de ver sido cerradas. Lo que deber\u00edamos haber hecho es enfocarnos un poco m\u00e1s y averiguar por qu\u00e9 la administraci\u00f3n quer\u00eda que se cerraran las clinicas. Nosotros no hicimos eso; era una medida de ahorro de dinero para reducir costos. Mis ojos se abrieron cuando visit\u00e9 las clinicas y me di cuenta de que no las est\u00e1bamos usando. No las anunciamos ni las promocionamos. No se sab\u00eda que exist\u00edan y que la gente pod\u00eda ir all\u00ed gratis.\u00a0Me di cuenta de que no aceptaban ni\u00f1es. Gracias a nuestra defensa, ahora est\u00e1n dando cuidado a ni\u00f1es. Est\u00e1n ampliando sus horarios y est\u00e1n empezando a promocionar las clinicas. As\u00ed que tuve un papel para garantizar que la administraci\u00f3n se diera cuenta de un problema relacionado con nuestro servicio de salud mental.Como sabe, los votantes de su distrito apoyaron abrumadoramente el refer\u00e9ndum Tratamiento, No Trauma durante en las votaciones al mitad del mandato del 2022. Si es elegido, \u00bfc\u00f3mo financiar\u00eda los planes espec\u00edficos bajo la ordenanza Tratamiento No Trauma?Tenemos fondos disponibles para Tratamiento No Trauma. El Departamento de Salud tiene un presupuesto s\u00f3lido. Podemos financiar Tratamiento No Trauma, sin problemas. Debido a que ese dinero est\u00e1 destinado a ciertas cosas, podemos tener ese dinero disponible para cosas como servicios de salud mental. Podemos usar el dinero que est\u00e1 disponible ahora.\u00a0No es tanto un problema de financiaci\u00f3n. Es un problema de intencionalidad. \u00bfLa gente quiere que esto suceda? No veo por qu\u00e9 no lo quicieran. Puede salvar la vida de alguien brind\u00e1ndole servicios de salud mental en lugar de traer a un oficial de polic\u00eda.\u00a0Un oficial de polic\u00eda est\u00e1 entrenado para hacer una determinada cosa. Los oficiales de polic\u00eda est\u00e1n capacitados para detener y arrestar. Ese es su trabajo. Es necesario en ciertos casos: cuando alguien te est\u00e1 robando, quieres a la polic\u00eda. Cuando alguien tiene un problema de salud mental, no quieres a la polic\u00eda. Quieres un experto en salud mental. Quiere a alguien que pueda decirle \"c\u00e1lmese\" o dirigirlo a los servicios adecuados. Necesita ese tipo de voz que te tranquiliza y que pueda ayudarte.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?Estamos a punto de tener una junta escolar representativa electa que ser\u00e1 aut\u00f3noma y trabajar\u00e1 de manera independiente. Mientras tanto, me asegurar\u00e9 de que las escuelas tengan todos los recursos necesarios para que tengan \u00e9xito. Soy un gran defensor de las escuelas del vecindario.\u00a0\u00a0Quiero asegurarme de que obtengamos todos los recursos posibles para la mayor\u00eda de los estudiantes porque eso es lo importante. El futuro de nuestra ciudad son nuestros ni\u00f1es. Quiero asegurarme de que todo lo que hagamos, en lo que se refiere a las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago, est\u00e9 en la l\u00ednea correcta, sin cometer ninguna locura. He trabajado con CTU [Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago] en el pasado y continuar\u00e9 trabajando con CTU en el futuro. Simplemente no estoy en deuda con CTU. No voy a dejarme dictar por nadie.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiar\u00e1 los planes para invertir en las escuelas del vecindario?He estado involucrado por mucho tiempo y tambi\u00e9n he sido presidente de LSC durante 12 a\u00f1os. Siempre he sido de la opini\u00f3n de que tenemos que manejar bien las finanzas de las escuelas. El dinero gastado en ciertas cosas rid\u00edculas a veces tiene que ser mirado y eliminado. Por lo tanto, desea asegurarme de que las escuelas puedan operar de manera independiente, dentro de los l\u00edmites de su presupuesto basado en la f\u00f3rmula del estudiante. Eso necesita ser cambiado, pero eso es parte de invertir en las escuelas. Creo que eso es parte de una discusi\u00f3n m\u00e1s larga que se tiene que hacer con el estado. Voy a sumergirme en ese tipo de cosas. Porque cuando hablo de restablecer Chicago, estos son los tipos de cosas que debemos restablecer.\u00bfA qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00e1 para la junta h\u00edbrida?Me gustar\u00eda una mezcla de educadores, personas de la comunidad y personas interesadas en el futuro de nuestros hijes. No creo que tenga una medida establecida probada y verdadera de a qui\u00e9n quiero nombrar en cuanto a personas. A\u00fan as\u00ed, deseo que las personas en la industria financiera entiendan c\u00f3mo operar los presupuestos y se adhieran a ellos. Quiere educadores, para que tengamos un plan adecuado para todes los estudiantes, no solo para los de alto rendimiento.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiero personas que puedan involucrar a los padres y otros miembros del comit\u00e9 para que se involucren en lo que sucede en las escuelas. Las escuelas deben estar abiertas todo el d\u00eda y la noche, con recursos y programas para los estudiantes y, si es necesario, para los padres. A veces los padres necesitan alguna formaci\u00f3n o educaci\u00f3n adicional. As\u00ed que quiero que todo eso suceda, y que la escuela sea el centro de ese vecindario con todos esos recursos en un solo lugar.Usted mencion\u00f3 que ha trabajado con el Sindicato de Maestros de Chicago. \u00bfHay alg\u00fan plan o propuesta espec\u00edfica que tenga para financiar las escuelas? Estuve mirando su sitio de web y no estaba muy claro c\u00f3mo ser\u00edan esas pol\u00edticas.Los fondos provienen de una variedad de fuentes: algunos provienen de los impuestos a la propiedad, algunos de nuestro gobierno estatal y federal, algunos de la ciudad de Chicago. Queremos asegurarnos de analizar todas esas fuentes de financiaci\u00f3n y ver c\u00f3mo est\u00e1n funcionando.Seguimos aumentando la financiaci\u00f3n escolar, aunque el n\u00famero de matr\u00edculas sigue bajando, algo no tiene sentido. Una vez que pueda llegar all\u00ed, echarle un vistazo a las fuentes de fondos y sumergirme en \u00e9l, veremos cu\u00e1l es el problema. \u00bfEs muy pesado al principio? \u00bfTiene CPS demasiadas propiedades inmobiliarias que no est\u00e1n funcionando? \u00bfSon cuestiones presupuestarias? \u00bfTenemos demasiados directores adjuntos y comisionados adjuntos en la oficina principal y necesitamos m\u00e1s personas en primera l\u00ednea ense\u00f1ando a nuestros hijes?S\u00e9 que muchas escuelas han eliminado los AP [subdirectores]. Pero, por ejemplo, eso no deber\u00eda pasar. Quitamos ayudantes en k\u00ednder y primer grado, donde ahora tienes una maestra sola con 35 ni\u00f1es de cinco a\u00f1os. No es un m\u00e9todo de apoyo, y no mejorar\u00e1 la educaci\u00f3n.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda investigar estas cosas y asegurarme de que estamos haciendo lo correcto para nuestros estudiantes, no necesariamente para el sindicato [CTU] o el personal de la oficina principal. Tenemos que concentrarnos en lo que es importante, y son esos ni\u00f1es.Nuestros lectores estan curiosos acerca de los impuestos. Entonces, \u00bflo que est\u00e1 proponiendo hacer requerir\u00eda aumentar los impuestos de la propiedad?No, ese ser\u00eda el \u00faltimo recurso. Dir\u00e9 que muchos candidatos usan esto como un punto de venta para decir \"no impuestos\" o \"nunca impuestos\". Deben de tener una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable. Una pol\u00edtica fiscal responsable, por ejemplo, en lo que se refiere a los impuestos de bienes y ra\u00edces, son pasos peque\u00f1os e incrementales para mejorar los impuestos.\u00a0Si nuestro IPC [\u00edndice de precios al consumidor] sube, deber\u00edamos tener un peque\u00f1o aumento en los impuestos a la propiedad para reflejar el aumento en el costo de los bienes y servicios. Entonces, si eso sucede, debemos hacer ese cambio incremental en lugar de lo que hemos estado haciendo ahora, diciendo que todo est\u00e1 bien. \u201cNo, no necesitamos aumentar los impuestos nunca, nunca, nunca hasta despu\u00e9s de una elecci\u00f3n de, 'oh, tenemos que aumentar los impuestos'. Eso es irresponsable, y est\u00e1 mal. Deber\u00edamos buscar pol\u00edticas fiscales m\u00e1s responsables, algo que la gente ni siquiera notar\u00e1 un aumento del uno al dos por ciento en sus impuestos de vez en cuando.Si el IPC baja, entonces podemos buscar descuentos y tal vez reembolsos para aquellos que pagan impuestos. Pero nuevamente, solo si el panorama financiero parece estar justificado, no solo porque a la gente le gusta escucharlo y no lo hacemos. Eso es lo que nos meti\u00f3 en el problema en primer lugar de no pagar nuestras obligaciones de pensi\u00f3n y no aumentar los impuestos para hacer cosas necesarias, en lugar de hacer cosas populares.Chicago es una ciudad llena de barrios vibrantes. Pero se est\u00e1 volviendo dif\u00edcil para muchas personas permanecer en la ciudad. Hay nuevos desarrollos que se avecinan en el centro de los barrios. Me refiero espec\u00edficamente al proyecto de Bally\u2019s casino. Usted vot\u00f3 a favor de eso. Entonces, \u00bfqu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para ayudar a los propietarios e inquilinos del desplazamiento o a las personas sin hogar?Vot\u00e9 a favor de eso. Uno, tenemos un presupuesto muy s\u00f3lido en este momento para personas sin hogar. El problema es que solo gastamos alrededor del 5 por ciento del dinero. Tenemos mucho dinero esperando para gastarlo en iniciativas para personas sin hogar. A veces estamos mirando en la direcci\u00f3n equivocada. No quiero gastar dinero que beneficiar\u00e1 a los desarrolladores m\u00e1s de lo que beneficia a las personas sin hogar. Ah\u00ed es donde realmente tengo un problema, y \u200b\u200blo mantengo.\u00a0\u00a0Entonces, cuando la gente habla de cosas como Bring Chicago Home, me encanta la intenci\u00f3n. Pero cuando empiezas analizar con mas cuidado, te das cuenta que los desarrolladores tender\u00edan a beneficiarse m\u00e1s que las personas sin hogar. Podemos ayudar a las personas sin hogar ahora mismo. Casi podemos erradicar la falta de vivienda excepto por un par de problemas.\u00a0Tenemos dinero para albergar a las personas que contamos. La mayor\u00eda de ellos no quieren entrar en los tipos de estructuras que estamos acostumbrados a construir. Prefieren estar en esa comunidad en la que est\u00e1n a la salida de Roosevelt Road en la autopista porque al menos saben que se van a cuidar unos a otros. Ah\u00ed es donde est\u00e1 su comunidad.\u00a0Puede que no lo entendamos. He hablado con suficientes personas sin hogar para saber que a veces la ayuda que buscan no es la ayuda que estamos acostumbrados a proporcionar. Si estamos diciendo, puedo cuidarte y ponerte en un refugio. No quieren estar en un refugio. Saben que les han robado, violado y asaltado en los albergues, tienen una mala experiencia en los albergues, no quieren volver.\u00a0Hablemos de brindarles recursos, tratamiento, oportunidad, empleo y capacitaci\u00f3n, para llevarlos a un espacio donde podamos conseguirles una casa o un apartamento de inicio, y luego puedan continuar recibiendo el tratamiento o la experiencia laboral para ganar dinero. Eso es lo que miro. Busco soluciones m\u00e1s org\u00e1nicas, no solo decir, oye, vamos a dejarlas en un albergue y hemos cumplido con nuestra parte. Eso no es suficiente.Recuerdo estar en una reuni\u00f3n en la que estaba con otros funcionarios electos Negros. En la reuni\u00f3n, explic\u00f3 lo desafiante que es para usted y sus colegas representar partes de Englewood porque tiene muchas propiedades vacantes y abandonadas. \u00bfCu\u00e1les son sus planes para revitalizar vecindarios, como Englewood, con muchas \u00e1reas/propiedades vacantes?Lo que no hacemos es dar a nuestros desarrolladores Negros y todos los desarrolladores que son minor\u00edas recursos y oportunidades para desarrollar en sus vecindarios. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, lo que sea. Tenemos \u00e1reas abandonadas por toda la ciudad y podr\u00edamos beneficiarnos de la llegada de desarrolladores. Ning\u00fan desarrollador del centro va a venir aqu\u00ed y te dir\u00e1 lo mismo. Un desarrollador me dijo que si construyo en Fulton Market, puedo obtener cierta cantidad por unidad que alquile o venda. Y si construyo en los otros vecindarios, no puede obtener tanto. \u00bfCu\u00e1l es mi incentivo para venir aqu\u00ed a construir?\u00a0Tenemos constructores afroamericanos que construir\u00e1n. Tendr\u00edamos que relajar algunos de los problemas sindicales y otros para darles una ventaja para hacer desarrollos de calidad aqu\u00ed en los lados sur y oeste.\u00a0Necesitamos comenzar a hacer eso y lograr que estos desarrolladores se involucren para que ya no puedan ser peque\u00f1os desarrolladores. Tendr\u00e1n una meta y una mentalidad para negociar m\u00e1s en un vecindario que los ayud\u00f3 a criarse en lugar de simplemente ir al centro.Pueden construir una cuadra a la vez. Tal vez dos o tres desarrolladores, luego construyan la cuadra completa y luego podemos hacer otra cuadra. Porque literalmente tengo cuadras de terreno bald\u00edo en esta peque\u00f1a \u00e1rea de Englewood que tengo. S\u00e9 que mis colegas tienen extensiones de tierra a\u00fan m\u00e1s grandes que podr\u00edan desarrollarse y venderse o alquilarse, o en cualquier caso, a propietarios que est\u00e1n trabajando, pero necesitan ayuda para llegar a fin de mes.\u00a0Podemos conseguirles esa vivienda asequible y de calidad aqu\u00ed. Cerca del tren. Si est\u00e1n trabajando en el centro de la ciudad, pueden subirse al tren y en 15 minutos llegar al trabajo o la escuela o donde tengan que estar. Necesitamos comenzar a ver eso en lugar de solo concentrarnos en el centro de la ciudad. Sin embargo, s\u00e9 lo importante que es el centro de la ciudad para nosotros. Pero no lo es todo.Los habitantes Negros de Chicago se han ido de la ciudad desde la d\u00e9cada del 2000 por muchas razones. Pero me pregunto, qu\u00e9 pol\u00edticas o planes espec\u00edficos promulgar\u00e1 su administraci\u00f3n para que no perdamos m\u00e1s habitantes Negros de Chicago.Debemos tener un plan de mercadotecnia para traer a la gente de regreso a Chicago. Literalmente deber\u00eda ser: traer a los habitantes de Chicago de vuelta a casa. Necesitamos comprometernos con la gente de mercadotecnia, preferiblemente con personas Negras. Chicago es una gran ciudad. Chicago tiene muchas comodidades. Es una ciudad de clase mundial. Podemos eliminar las cosas problem\u00e1ticas y hacerlas vibrantes. No hay otra ciudad mejor.\u00a0Necesitamos promover eso y hacer una inversi\u00f3n. A veces hay que invertir para recuperar algo. No me gusta gastar dinero por gastar dinero; los sorteos y trucos no son lo mio. As\u00ed que vamos a hacer verdaderas inversiones en Chicago, invertir en el futuro de Chicago, asegur\u00e1ndonos de que las personas sepan lo grandiosa que es Chicago y las comodidades que podemos brindarles.\u00a0Englewood se puede restaurar a gran gloria. Es intencional de quien est\u00e1 a la cabeza, encabezando eso, y tiene ese sentido de visi\u00f3n para decir que podemos hacer esto aqu\u00ed en Englewood, podemos hacer esto en East Garfield Park, podemos hacer esto en Lawndale. Podemos hacer esto y todas estas otras \u00e1reas desafiantes, como Pilsen y La Villita. Podemos hacerlo en \u00e1reas que han sido marginadas en el pasado. Se necesita que el l\u00edder en la cima diga, esto es lo que vamos a hacer, y as\u00ed es como lo haremos.\u00bfC\u00f3mo financiamos eso?Hay una variedad de formas de financiarlo. Hay financiaci\u00f3n de bonos. Hay muchos mecanismos de financiaci\u00f3n diferentes, especialmente en las zonas deterioradas. Trabajaremos con nuestros socios en el gobierno estatal y federal. Puede que tengamos que emitir bonos. Tuvimos que emitir algo de deuda para hacer algunas de las cosas y ponerlas en marcha. Hay una variedad de formas. No estamos sin dinero. A veces luchamos porque tomamos malas decisiones, y necesitamos tomar menos malas decisiones y m\u00e1s decisiones conservadoras desde el punto de vista financiero que tengan sentido. Haces inversiones; no gastas dinero.Hablando de invertir en Black Chicago y mantener a los Negros aqu\u00ed, \u00bfdeber\u00edan las reparaciones estar al frente como prioridad en el 2023?Siento que si deber\u00eda ser asi. He estado tratando de impulsar las reparaciones durante a\u00f1os. Despu\u00e9s de conocer m\u00e1s al respecto, lo present\u00e9 al Concejo Municipal. El alcalde me dijo: \u201cYo no voy a hacer nada sobre las reparaciones; eso no es m\u00e1s que un truco de Willie Wilson\u201d.El Sr. Wilson nos estaba ayudando financieramente con la difusi\u00f3n de las reparaciones. Tambi\u00e9n estaba aprendiendo sobre las reparaciones. Est\u00e1bamos haciendo lo que pod\u00edamos para mostrar lo importante es la reparaci\u00f3n. He hablado con epidemi\u00f3logos y epigenetistas.Los problemas que tenemos actualmente se remontan a que estabamos esclavizados y atravesamos la era de Jim Crow, y la discriminacion basado en los vecindarios, y todas las cosas por las que hemos pasado durante d\u00e9cadas y d\u00e9cadas, y eso nos hace reaccionar de cierta manera. Necesitamos sumergirnos en eso y descubrir cu\u00e1l es ese problema, y \u200b\u200buna vez que lo hagamos, todos se beneficiar\u00e1n. As\u00ed que no estoy tan interesado en otra cosa que no sean los 40 acres y el dinero. Eso es m\u00e1s una conversaci\u00f3n federal. Lo m\u00edo son m\u00e1s las brechas de salud, las brechas educativas y cosas as\u00ed que son importantes, y hay una raz\u00f3n para ello. Hay una raz\u00f3n para eso, y no creo que lo hayamos profundizado lo suficiente. Hay una palabra para eso. La alcalde [Lightfoot] no usar\u00eda la palabra reparaciones. Si le preguntas, no dir\u00eda reparaciones.\u00bfSu plan inicial era solo obtener una comisi\u00f3n de personas?Ya hemos estudiado bastante. No se trataba de un estudio. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n de reparaciones igual a Calles y Saneamiento y al Departamento de Transporte. Quer\u00eda una comisi\u00f3n a nivel ejecutivo sobre reparaciones para discutir la reparaci\u00f3n que necesitamos como descendientes de africanos esclavizados.\u00a0\u00a0No pude obtener apoyo. Ni siquiera pude obtener el apoyo de la gente Negra. Fue dif\u00edcil porque la gente no lo entend\u00eda. Recuerdo que algunos de mis colegas asistieron a un par de reuniones porque ten\u00eda que tener reuniones fuera del sitio y no pude obtener una reuni\u00f3n en el consejo.\u00a0Bajo mi administraci\u00f3n, las reparaciones estar\u00e1n a primera fila. Tenemos que hablar de eso. Tenemos que hacerlo. Tenemos que entender, y quiero que m\u00e1s gente entienda. Quiero que los blancos y todos lo entiendan porque es vital para todos.Me di cuenta de que no necesariamente tiene patrocinios a gran escala como sus otros oponentes en la carrera.No, porque no estoy en deuda con nadie en esta carrera.Entonces, \u00bfa qui\u00e9n le rindes cuentas?Soy responsable ante los ciudadanos de la ciudad de Chicago. Estas son las personas que tengo en alta estima y me siento responsable ante los residentes cotidianos, las personas que van a trabajar todos los d\u00edas, las personas desempleadas, las personas que luchan y las personas que les va bien. Represento a los verdaderos habitantes de Chicago, aquellos que quieren buenas escuelas, distritos comerciales vibrantes, calles seguras y disfrutar de sus vecindarios y volver a casa seguros. Estas son las personas que represento. Estas son las personas que me apoyan.Tuve que repasar algunos art\u00edculos y entrevistas anteriores para preparar mis preguntas de hoy porque su sitio web al momento de esta entrevista todavia no tiene una plataforma de pol\u00edticas escrita. \u00bfC\u00f3mo pueden los votantes de Chicago confiar en usted como legislador y responsabilizarlo por sus promesas de campa\u00f1a?He sido tan prodigioso en asuntos de pol\u00edtica como cualquier concejal del Concejo Municipal. Desde la lucha contra la privatizaci\u00f3n hasta la reforma policial y las iniciativas comerciales, he demostrado mis habilidades para hacer que las cosas avancen y cumplirlasa.\u00a0La junta escolar representativa electa, estuvimos all\u00ed; paz laboral en los aeropuertos y cuidado de ni\u00f1es. Estas son cosas en las que siempre tuve al frente, liderando, no solo votando por ello, liderando, abogando por obtener votos, azotando votos y aprob\u00e1ndolo.\u00a0Mi historia habla por s\u00ed misma, tengo los antecedentes y experiencia. He demostrado que puedo trabajar en diferentes comit\u00e9s. Trabajo con miembros de DSA [Socialistas Democr\u00e1ticos de Am\u00e9rica]. Trabajo con el caucus conservador. Trabajo con el caucus de veteranos, trabajo con todos. Me aseguro de que mis ordenanzas obtengan el apoyo de todos los niveles de representaci\u00f3n en el consejo. Eso es lo que obtendr\u00e1n del alcalde Sawyer."

  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green va a ser visto y escuchado. Green es una cara familiar en las protestas que buscaban justicia para Laquan McDonald y otras v\u00edctimas de la violencia policial. En el 2017 a solo 21 a\u00f1os, Green lleg\u00f3 a los titulares nacionales cuando le dijo a una audiencia de MSNBC Townhall que el ex alcalde Rahm Emanuel no se preocupa por la gente Negra.Hoy, contin\u00faa confrontando a los pol\u00edticos de frente; durante foros de candidatos recientes, llam\u00f3 a los opositores por ocupar el cargo durante a\u00f1os pero no actuar con urgencia para sanar el trauma de la comunidad y mejorar las condiciones de los j\u00f3venes Negros y Latines.\u00a0El 3 de enero, Green invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE a la oficina de su campa\u00f1a en la 87 y Halsted en el vecindario de Auburn Gresham. Cubierto con letreros de \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green para Alcalde\u201d, con un autob\u00fas de campa\u00f1a estacionado afuera de su oficina, anteriormente un bano Chase, se destaca en un centro comercial en ruinas. Para entrar a la oficina repleta de voluntarios, entre ellos los hijos de Green, tuvimos que presentar identificaciones con fotograf\u00eda.Durante nuestra entrevista, Green no se retract\u00f3 de su punto de vista cual tiene desde hace mucho tiempo sobre la policia y vigilancia.\u00a0\u201cNo invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero para aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia\u201d, dijo Green. En su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, Green pide una reforma policial que haga que \u201cla vigilancia sea m\u00e1s atractiva\u201d.Comparti\u00f3 ideas sobre la creaci\u00f3n de un banco p\u00fablico que sea propiedad de la ciudad que dar\u00eda a los residentes el poder de invertir en sus comunidades. Las prioridades del banco ser\u00edan viviendas asequibles, propiedad de viviendas, nuevos desarrollos y pr\u00e9stamos para peque\u00f1as empresas.\u00a0Tambi\u00e9n quiere reducir la violencia a la mitad, crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios y lanzar \u201cuniversal 3K\u201d, cual es preescolar para ni\u00f1es de hasta tres a\u00f1os en adelante.\u00a0Sin embargo, sin ninguna experiencia pol\u00edtica ejecutiva, algunos votantes de Chicago se preguntan c\u00f3mo Green, el candidato m\u00e1s joven de la carrera, har\u00e1 realidad sus nobles ideas.\u00a0Adem\u00e1s, se le ha relacionado con algunas pol\u00e9micas en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. En 2021, hizo circular rumores en las redes sociales sobre la renuncia de Lightfoot. \u00c9l tuite\u00f3: \u201cLori Lightfoot renunciar\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana en un sorprendente final para su alcald\u00eda\u201d. M\u00e1s tarde se disculp\u00f3 y el tuit se elimin\u00f3 desde entonces.Cuando les organizadores de la liberaci\u00f3n liderado por mujeres Negras y queer en Chicago, como BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters y Let Us Breathe Collective, expresaron su oposici\u00f3n a la campa\u00f1a de Lightfoot del 2019 debido a su afiliaci\u00f3n con la junta de polic\u00eda, Green la respald\u00f3.\u00a0Dijo que la asesor\u00f3 en la Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud y durante la pandemia de COVID-19, pero luego los dos comenzaron a chocar. En el 2021 llam\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n a Lightfoot por bloquear su esfuerzo por convertir la escuela primaria Garrett Morgan en el vecindario de Auburn-Gresham, cerrada por Emanuel, en un centro juvenil de $15 millones.Y en diciembre del 2022, una disputa de a\u00f1os entre Green y el campo del oponente Willie Wilson se desbord\u00f3 cuando la grabaci\u00f3n de audio supuestamente entre el asesor pol\u00edtico de Wilson, Rickey Hendon, y el voluntario de la campa\u00f1a de Green, Kevin Hobby, se filtr\u00f3 en las redes sociales, detallando un soborno para que el equipo de Green abandonara la petici\u00f3n contra Wilson. Desaf\u00edo contra Wilson. En el 2019, Hendon desafi\u00f3 las firmas de petici\u00f3n de Green y Green se retir\u00f3 de la contienda.\u00a0Lea nuestra entrevista completa con Green como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).The TRiiBE: La generaci\u00f3n de millennials de Chicago desafiaron las expectativas en las elecciones intermedias del 2022 como el segundo bloque de votantes m\u00e1s grande. En el 2012, los millennials Negros de Chicago, tras el asesinato policial de Rekia Boyd, tambi\u00e9n crearon el cimiento para el movimiento emergente de la liberaci\u00f3n Negra. Usted fue parte de la comunidad organizadora que busc\u00f3 justicia para Laquan McDonald. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el liderazgo de la generaci\u00f3n millennial a nivel de alcalde?Ja'Mal Green: Los habitantes de Chicago han visto que la pol\u00edtica de la ciudad no ha funcionado y no est\u00e1 en los mejores intereses de la clase trabajadora com\u00fan. Ahora estamos en un momento crucial en el que la generaci\u00f3n joven no tiene esperanza. Los j\u00f3venes mueren, cometen actos de violencia o son atrapados robando autos. Algunos est\u00e1n tratando de criar familias en Chicago.\u00a0Simplemente no hay ning\u00fan tipo de esperanza en este momento. Familias de toda la ciudad, se est\u00e1n yendo. Los negocios se van. Chicago est\u00e1 dispuesta a arriesgarse con alguien que tenga un plan, se preocupe por los ciudadanos comunes, sea m\u00e1s joven y presente ideas innovadoras.\u00a0Una de las cosas m\u00e1s importantes de esta carrera es que Chicago est\u00e1 lista para el cambio. Todav\u00eda tienen que obtener los resultados que han necesitado durante tanto tiempo. No se han sentido seguros durante tanto tiempo. [Los funcionarios electos] hicieron promesas que no cumplieron y [los residentes de Chicago] est\u00e1n listos para probar algo nuevo.Creciste en las \u00e1reas del sur y oeste de Chicago. \u00bfC\u00f3mo molde\u00f3 vivir en estas dos partes de la cuidad su pol\u00edtica y perspectiva de la vida?Crec\u00ed en Gresham. Ha sido mi hogar durante toda mi vida. La primera cuadra en la que viv\u00ed fue la 86 y Union. Esos eran propietarios que se preocupaban por la cuadra y todos los j\u00f3venes de la cuadra.Ten\u00eda al Sr. Riley, que acababa de morir, que me daba un d\u00f3lar por cada \"A\" que ten\u00eda, y ten\u00edamos un pueblo. Mirando hacia atr\u00e1s en todos los otros lugares en los que he vivido, no hay otro bloque como ese. Eso me dio una base que me mostr\u00f3 c\u00f3mo es un pueblo y c\u00f3mo las personas pueden unirse y amarse unos a otros y cuidarse unos a otros y cuidar a los hijos de los dem\u00e1s.Mi pap\u00e1 estaba en K-town. Lo visitaba para estad\u00edas prolongadas y los fines de semana. Vi las diferencias en cada lado de la ciudad, donde las comunidades no ten\u00edan los recursos que necesitaban, donde la gente sufr\u00eda y necesitaba servicios de salud mental, o carec\u00edan de un hogar, o algunos estaban involucrados en alg\u00fan tipo de actividad criminal porque no tengo alternativa. Todo lo que he visto en estos vecindarios me convirti\u00f3 en la persona que soy hoy para saber que necesitamos un enfoque pol\u00edtico m\u00e1s centrado en las personas.\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 se ingreso en la contienda por la alcald\u00eda de Chicago por segunda vez consecutiva? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no postularse para un puesto en el Concejo Municipal de Chicago?Ning\u00fan miembro del concejo municipal ha sido elegido alcalde de la ciudad de Chicago. Entonces, la segunda parte de eso es la visi\u00f3n, y la agenda que debe avanzar en nuestra ciudad debe avanzar en la parte superior, y es por eso que me postulo para alcalde.No busco ser un pol\u00edtico de carrera e ir de asiento en asiento. Busco tener el impacto que necesito tener a gran escala y luego apartarme del camino, pasar la antorcha e inspirar a otra generaci\u00f3n a dar un paso al frente. Me postul\u00e9 para alcalde la \u00faltima vez y me retir\u00e9 antes de la votaci\u00f3n.Esta es t\u00e9cnicamente mi primera candidatura porque en realidad estoy en la boleta electoral. No ten\u00edamos la infraestructura que necesit\u00e1bamos [en aquel entonces]. Esta vez tenemos mucho apoyo en toda la ciudad. El reconocimiento de mi nombre es muy alto en toda la ciudad. Las docenas de empresas y miles de personas que ayudaron a impulsar esta campa\u00f1a han sido asombrosas. As\u00ed que decid\u00ed participar esta vez porque me llamaron y porque la gente quiere una nueva voz, una voz joven que represente a todo Chicago.Los rumores, o simplemente lo que comenta la gente, es que la \u00faltima vez esperaba conseguir un puesto en la administraci\u00f3n de Lightfoot.No. Nunca trabajar\u00eda para una administraci\u00f3n. Porque no necesito hacerlo. Tengo muchos negocios, y ser\u00eda un conflicto para m\u00ed. Entonces, con Lori, la aconsej\u00e9 cuando me lo pidi\u00f3 y la ayud\u00e9 con las pol\u00edticas hasta que no pudimos llevarnos bien.\u00bfHay algo espec\u00edfico que puedas nombrar que estabas apoyando o aconsejando?S\u00ed. La Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud. Hice una peque\u00f1a serie con ella en l\u00ednea durante la pandemia desde el principio para ayudarla a hablar sobre COVID-19. Los videos tuvieron alrededor de 100.000 visitas en l\u00ednea y les fue bien.As\u00ed que trat\u00e9 de ayudarla a humanizarla y hacer que se quedara con pol\u00edticas reales que tuvieran sentido. Pero Lori es Lori. Al final del d\u00eda, reconozco por qu\u00e9 no nos ca\u00edmos bien durante seis a\u00f1os antes de eso. Solo trat\u00e9 de decir que quiero que la ciudad sea mejor, y no te estoy pidiendo nada. No necesito el dinero. no necesito nada No necesito un trabajo. Quiero estas pol\u00edticas para que estos j\u00f3venes tengan espacios y caminos para ser productivos.No pude lograr eso con ella y esta administraci\u00f3n, as\u00ed que me postulo para que esto suceda.Cuando se habla de violencia armada, muchas veces olvidan a les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine. Por lo general, usted habla sobre la violencia armada, especialmente cuando afecta a les ni\u00f1es. \u00bfC\u00f3mo invertir\u00e1 usted en la seguridad? \u00bfY hay formas fuera de la vigilancia en las que invertir\u00e1 en la seguridad? \u00bfPuede describir c\u00f3mo se ver\u00e1 esa inverci\u00f3n?Hoy lanzamos un plan de $5 mil millones. Eso se llama EPIC: Prevenci\u00f3n de la prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, intervenci\u00f3n y reforma del CPD. La base de nuestro programa es garantizar que creamos vecindarios pr\u00f3speros donde invertimos en los j\u00f3venes y donde CPD es un sistema de apoyo y no una fuerza opresiva. No invertiremos m\u00e1s dinero en aumentar la polic\u00eda en esta ciudad. As\u00ed no se resuelve la violencia.\u00a0Adoptaremos un enfoque hol\u00edstico y haremos las cosas de la manera correcta. Entonces, cuando hablas de prosperidad econ\u00f3mica, nuestro n\u00famero de la suerte es 10,000. Queremos crear 10,000 nuevos propietarios de vivienda al instituir bonos hipotecarios unifamiliares y pr\u00e9stamos retroactivos a nivel de ciudad cada a\u00f1o para que podamos repoblar los vecindarios. Por lo tanto, las personas que est\u00e1n en esos vecindarios o se han ido y tienen ra\u00edces, ya sea que se muden a los suburbios o a otras ciudades, los incentivamos para que regresen respaldando su pr\u00e9stamo, brind\u00e1ndoles un pago inicial y asistencia para los costos de cierre.Me encantar\u00eda volver a eso porque tengo preguntas sobre viviendas asequibles y sobre las rentas de inquilinos.Entonces, una de las piezas se llama Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Esencialmente, de lo que se trata es de que vamos a tener un programa de asistencia directa en efectivo, donde vamos a dar $1,000 por mes a 10,000 familias cada a\u00f1o para sacarlas de la pobreza.Todos los participantes de este programa deber\u00e1n tomar una clase de educaci\u00f3n financiera. Luego, tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1n 90 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s del inicio de los pagos para hacer una de cuatro cosas: obtener vivienda, inscripci\u00f3n educativa, tratamiento por abuso de sustancias o asegurar una oportunidad de trabajo. Har\u00e1n una de esas cuatro cosas. Despu\u00e9s de eso, pueden continuar recibiendo asistencia en efectivo durante el a\u00f1o.\u00a0Los evaluaremos ese a\u00f1o y podr\u00e1n volver a presentar una solicitud para un segundo y \u00faltimo a\u00f1o. Con este programa de $150 millones, es importante brindar los cimientos a las personas que lo necesitan y sacarlos de la pobreza. Muchos estudios han demostrado que al proporcionar efectivo directo a personas que viven tiempos dif\u00edciles, la mayor parte de ese dinero se gasta en sus necesidades b\u00e1sicas, ya sea vivienda, comida, etc.Ha dicho que quiere que los impuestos que paga la gente de Chicago dejen de ser usados para pagar la facturas que cubren los costos de las demandas por mala conducta policial. Tambi\u00e9n mencion\u00f3 que quer\u00eda que los polic\u00edas obtengan seguro. \u00bfSigue siendo este el caso?Ese sigue siendo el caso. Todav\u00eda estamos examin\u00e1ndolo y averiguando c\u00f3mo implementarlo. No vamos a seguir pagando $100 millones por mala conducta policial. No va a suceder bajo mi supervisi\u00f3n, y ser\u00e1 una prioridad de mi administraci\u00f3n implementar y aprobar un plan para que ese proyecto de ley vaya a otra persona.Deber\u00eda ir en nombre de la polic\u00eda. Si tienen un seguro de responsabilidad civil, las compa\u00f1\u00edas de seguros pueden evaluar la responsabilidad sobre si son un riesgo en funci\u00f3n de sus quejas. Entonces, si obtienen casos de seguros de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares, esa compa\u00f1\u00eda los dejar\u00e1. Si no tienen seguro, no pueden ser polic\u00edas en las calles de Chicago.\u00a0\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 debemos seguir permitiendo que los agentes de polic\u00eda acumulen millones de d\u00f3lares en acuerdos y no hay rendici\u00f3n de cuentas? Jason Van Dyke le dispar\u00f3 a Laquan 16 veces. Pero antes de ese caso, ya ten\u00eda acuerdos de seis cifras de casos en los que actu\u00f3 de manera inapropiada.Tenemos que empezar a responsabilizarlos. Tambi\u00e9n vamos a multar a los oficiales con hasta $5,000 si [ellos] apagan sus c\u00e1maras corporales o hacen un uso inadecuado del equipo.\u00a0Tendremos tolerancia cero con los agentes de polic\u00eda que se afilien a grupos de odio.Implementaremos una aplicaci\u00f3n en la que las personas puedan calificar sus interacciones con los agentes de polic\u00eda. Supongamos que tiene una interacci\u00f3n con la polic\u00eda. En ese caso, podr\u00e1 calificar al oficial de polic\u00eda, as\u00ed como cargar datos en tiempo real [para] tener evidencia de un caso. Pueden ir a una agencia de investigaci\u00f3n para poder verlo, y tambi\u00e9n podemos recompensar a los oficiales de polic\u00eda que obtienen buenas interacciones [de] la comunidad.Por otro lado, tambi\u00e9n vamos a ayudar a los polic\u00edas de la fuerza. Los suicidios est\u00e1n en su punto m\u00e1s alto. Vamos a aumentar la cantidad de terapeutas por distrito policial y vamos a cambiar nuestro horario de trabajo a una semana laboral de cuatro o tres d\u00edas con un d\u00eda de salud mental en el medio para que podamos comenzar a controlar las tasas de suicidio en el departamento de polic\u00eda.En su sitio de web, mencion\u00f3 que desea crear hogares de sanaci\u00f3n donde aquellos que sufren problemas de salud mental puedan encontrar refugio. Y tambi\u00e9n acaba de mencionar que se enviar\u00e1 un trabajador social capacitado a los hogares para reducir la tensi\u00f3n en situaciones que no sean de emergencia. Eso suena similar a la ordenanza de Treatment Not Trauma, tratamiento no trauma. \u00bfApoya esa ordenanza?Pasaremos Tratamiento No Trauma. Necesitamos reabrir las instalaciones de salud mental que cerr\u00f3 Rahm Emanuel.\u00bfCu\u00e1l es s\u00fa plan para eso?Planeamos reabrir cl\u00ednicas y encontrar los mejores lugares en las comunidades para abrir centros de bienestar que utilicen un enfoque hol\u00edstico de la salud mental. Ser\u00e1 una instituci\u00f3n donde podr\u00e1 obtener servicios de consejer\u00eda, yoga, boxeo, k\u00e1rate, masajes terap\u00e9uticos y tratamientos de spa.Necesitamos invertir en eso para que las personas de toda la ciudad, ya sean j\u00f3venes, polic\u00edas o quienes sean, puedan ver esta instituci\u00f3n como un lugar donde pueden relajarse. Nuestra idea innovadora es tomar lo que est\u00e1n haciendo y expandirlo a una instituci\u00f3n a la que todos quisieran ir.Como parte de la generaci\u00f3n de millennials usted parece estar m\u00e1s conectado con la juventud Negra y Latine en Chicago en formas que las otras campa\u00f1as no lo est\u00e1n, principalmente a trav\u00e9s de su trabajo con Majostee All Stars. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 es importante para usted apoyar y elevar las voces de los j\u00f3venes de Chicago? \u00bfEs ese un compromiso que mantendr\u00e1 si es elegido como alcalde?Una de las cosas que consegu\u00ed que hiciera la actual alcalde fue transmitir mi idea de tener la primera Comisi\u00f3n de la Juventud en la ciudad para asesorar a la oficina del alcalde. Es muy importante que se escuchen las voces de los j\u00f3venes. Una vez you fui joven. Todavia recuerdo cuando la gente dec\u00eda que estaba muy joven y que necesitaba quedarme en mi lugar y que mi voz no ten\u00eda mucha importancia.\u00a0Por eso es importante para m\u00ed asegurarme que se invierta en los j\u00f3venes y eliminar las barreras. Nuestros l\u00edderes se han aferrado constantemente al poder y al dinero; esencialmente, est\u00e1n esperando morir. Luego, cuando mueran, \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el siguiente plan? Como no capacitan a la pr\u00f3xima generaci\u00f3n, no colocan a los j\u00f3venes en posiciones de poder. No invierten en los j\u00f3venes. Solo quieren que sigamos votando por ellos hasta que tengan 100 a\u00f1os. Eso no es justo. Eso no debe de ser as\u00ed. As\u00ed no es como deber\u00eda ser. Los j\u00f3venes necesitan la oportunidad de ocupar puestos para crecer y prosperar, y ese es mi compromiso.La pandemia del COVID-19 ha puesto de relieve las disparidades ya existentes en las escuelas mayormente Negras y Latine. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas y pol\u00edticas promulgar\u00e1 para apoyar a las escuelas primarias y secundarias de los vecindarios para que les ni\u00f1es Negros y Latine no tengan que salir de sus comunidades para ir a la escuela?La calidad de la educaci\u00f3n debe ser determinada por el ingreso medio del vecindario. Uno de los mayores problemas de nuestra ciudad es que tenemos un sistema escolar de inscripci\u00f3n selectiva. Obtuvimos una f\u00f3rmula basada en la inscripci\u00f3n en el estado y comunidades desinvertidas. Por lo tanto, se ha desinvertido de las escuelas. Fui a muchas escuelas p\u00fablicas y tuve desaf\u00edos. Yo era uno de los ni\u00f1es m\u00e1s brillantes de todas las escuelas y tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda dificultades con mi comportamiento. Mostr\u00e9 ciertos comportamientos que las escuelas no estaban preparadas para abordar o para darme la atenci\u00f3n que necesitaba.Lo que sucede en el distrito es que si tienes un ni\u00f1e con desaf\u00edos, escribir\u00e1n un IEP (Programa de Educaci\u00f3n Individualizado) y tratar\u00e1n de obtener alg\u00fan medicamento o algo as\u00ed.\u00a0\u00a0As\u00ed que no hay un enfoque hol\u00edstico real. Los j\u00f3venes de estos vecindarios que est\u00e1n pasando por tanto trauma, que tienen tanto dolor, que podr\u00edan estar sin hogar y hambrientos, entran a un edificio escolar y se espera que aprendan dos m\u00e1s dos sin el plan de estudios, los libros o la tecnolog\u00eda adecuados. Estamos fallando a los j\u00f3venes todos los d\u00edas en las Escuelas P\u00fablicas de Chicago.\u00a0Necesitamos asegurarnos de presionar a la legislatura estatal para que cambie la f\u00f3rmula para las escuelas p\u00fablicas. Debe estar basado en las necesidades. Queremos invertir para asegurarnos de que programas de entrenamiento de trabajo y trabajos tecnol\u00f3gicos est\u00e9n en las escuelas de toda la ciudad. Necesitamos alternativas para los j\u00f3venes y asegurarnos de que est\u00e9n aprendiendo habilidades y diferentes campos profesionales que puedan seguir.\u00a0Necesitamos invertir en los j\u00f3venes desde temprano. As\u00ed que estamos presentando un plan de preescolar para garantizar que haya programas y escuelas p\u00fablicas en toda la ciudad donde les ni\u00f1es de tan solo tres a\u00f1os puedan comenzar a aprender antes incluso de pasar al prek\u00ednder que los har\u00e1 m\u00e1s inteligentes y va a estimular sus mentes. Es bueno para las madres solteras que buscan cuidado de ni\u00f1os y quieren trabajar.Necesitamos ense\u00f1ar a estos j\u00f3venes temprano para que puedan tener las habilidades que necesitan para ser lo mejor que puedan ser cuando crezcan. Universal 3K es un plan que tambi\u00e9n queremos implementar.Los j\u00f3venes de Chicago tienen muy pocos lugares para reunirse y socializar de manera segura. \u00bfC\u00f3mo sugiere que apoyemos a los j\u00f3venes de manera no punitiva dentro y fuera de CPS?Necesitamos invertir en espacios seguros. Hay mucha gente en la ciudad que est\u00e1 haciendo un buen trabajo con los j\u00f3venes. No necesitamos reinventar lo que ya se esta haciendo o tener nosotros que ser la fuerza impulsora detr\u00e1s de todo. Necesitamos ver d\u00f3nde est\u00e1n las personas que hacen el trabajo e ir a ellas y decirles, \u201c\u00bfc\u00f3mo pueden expandirse? \u00bfCu\u00e1nto necesitas para expandirse?\u201d Para que podamos tener espacios realmente seguros donde los j\u00f3venes puedan crecer y prosperar. As\u00ed que destinaremos mucho dinero para crear espacios seguros para los j\u00f3venes en nuestras comunidades.\u00bfEst\u00e1 familiarizado con la ordenanza de GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book? Si es as\u00ed, \u00bfel apoyar esa ordenanza se alinea con su compromiso con la juventud de Chicago?S\u00ed, fui mentor de muchos j\u00f3venes involucrados en GoodKid MacCity\u2019s Peach Book a lo largo de los a\u00f1os. Armaron un buen plan.Estoy seguro de que hay algunos ajustes que podemos modificar y mejorar. El punto es que hay una organizaci\u00f3n de j\u00f3venes que se presentan y dicen, \u201caqu\u00ed hay un plan\u201d, especialmente aquellos j\u00f3venes que arriesgan sus vidas diariamente y est\u00e1n al frente de todo. Necesitan una voz, \u00bfverdad? As\u00ed que ll\u00e9venlos a la mesa, escuchen el plan y vean c\u00f3mo podemos fortalecer ese plan, trabajar juntos y crear algo que funcione.En el video de su campa\u00f1a, anunci\u00f3 su deseo de apoyar y expandir que las personas sean propietarios de su vivienda. Anteriormente en nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, habl\u00f3 sobre querer obtener 10,000 o m\u00e1s nuevos propietarios en el futuro. Tiene un marco o iniciativa existente que cre\u00f3 a trav\u00e9s de la organizaci\u00f3n My Turn to Own. \u00bfEs ese un modelo que cree que se puede usar a mayor escala? \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 s\u00ed o por qu\u00e9 no?My Turn to Own es una organizaci\u00f3n que ense\u00f1a a las personas c\u00f3mo convertirse en propietarios de viviendas y les brinda la educaci\u00f3n financiera que necesitan. Luego, despu\u00e9s de someterlos al proceso y lograr que sean due\u00f1os de una casa, tambi\u00e9n les ense\u00f1amos c\u00f3mo mantener esa casa en el proceso.\u00a0Esto es muy importante porque respaldaremos pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios a gran escala. Hay personas en comunidades que ni siquiera conocen sus puntajes de cr\u00e9dito y ni siquiera saben c\u00f3mo calificar porque han estado alquilando durante tantas d\u00e9cadas que nunca ha estado en su radar. Entonces esa ser\u00e1 una pieza clave de nuestra administraci\u00f3n para expandir algo as\u00ed en toda la ciudad.Muchos de nuestros lectores son inquilinos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 iniciativas implementar\u00e1 para proteger a las personas del desplazamiento y apoyar a las personas sin hogar?Tenemos que aumentar la cantidad de viviendas asequibles. No tiene sentido que ni siquiera podamos construir 2,500 unidades de viviendas asequibles al a\u00f1o. Daremos subsidios fiscales a las grandes tiendas, iglesias, bancos y personas que poseen grandes edificios para construir unidades de viviendas asequibles. Incentivaremos a las personas a construir sobre cualquier espacio de un solo piso o un edificio de un solo piso.\u00a0El Banco P\u00fablico es otra gran pieza de la que hablo mucho. Crearemos nuestro propio motor econ\u00f3mico al tener un banco p\u00fablico que invierta en pr\u00e9stamos hipotecarios, casas asequibles y peque\u00f1as empresas. Esa ganancia del banco vuelve directamente a los servicios de la ciudad.As\u00ed que vamos a construir viviendas basadas en ingresos en la ciudad de Chicago, y el sector p\u00fablico tendr\u00e1 mucho control sobre esas rentas. Luego, como parte de incentivar esas unidades de vivienda asequible, tambi\u00e9n nos aseguraremos de que existan criterios para mantener los precios accesibles de renta de las unidades que est\u00e1n construyendo.Soy alguien que apoya mucho el tener establecido acuerdos de beneficios comunitarios para que los desarrolladores privados que est\u00e1n construyendo sepan que tienen que seguir esos acuerdos. No podemos esperar a que un desarrollador privado venga al vecindario a construir unidades de vivienda asequibles.Apoya Bring Chicago Home, la iniciativa llamada Regresar Chicago a Casa?S\u00ed, apoyo la propuesta de Bring Chicago Home de tener un flujo de financiaci\u00f3n dedicado para personas sin hogar y viviendas asequibles.Anteriormente en la conversaci\u00f3n, mencion\u00f3 a qui\u00e9n usted asume su responsabilidad. Hemos sido testigos de como en el pasado candidatos a la alcald\u00eda cooptan el lenguaje organizador progresista y abolicionista, y hacen grandes promesas durante su campa\u00f1a a la gente Negra de Chicago, solo para retractarse de esas promesas cuando est\u00e1n al cargo. Si usted es elegido como alcalde, \u00bfC\u00f3mo puede la gente Negra de Chicago asegurarse que usted va a asumir su responsabilidad por llevar a cabo todas las pol\u00edticas que les prometi\u00f3 durante la campa\u00f1a?Pondremos diferentes cosas en su lugar para permitir que los organizadores tengan un asiento en la mesa. Por ejemplo, estamos buscando una comisi\u00f3n, una especie de agente de poder, donde los organizadores laborales y la gente en primera l\u00ednea pueden tener una gran voz en la oficina del alcalde.\u00a0Eso es clave para m\u00ed. Esperamos rendir cuentas por todo lo que decimos. Estoy en la contienda hablando de lo que voy a hacer lo cual es parte de mi historial de lo que he hecho. Soy el \u00fanico candidato con un historial de hacer todas estas cosas.\u00a0Cuando llegas al gobierno, las cosas pueden cambiar. Por eso la gente no conf\u00eda en los pol\u00edticos. Estoy tratando de cambiar eso. Quiero la confianza de la gente de Chicago y, por lo tanto, en todo lo que diga, har\u00e9 todo lo posible para mantener mi palabra. Estamos siempre abiertos a que la gente nos recuerde que tenemos que asumir nuestra responsabilidad. Este es un juego de palabras, y le doy mi palabra a la gente de Chicago."

  "title": "Antes de Votar en el 2023: Conversaci\u00f3n con Sophie King",
  "text": "La Concejal Sophia King (Distrito 4) lleva sus ra\u00edces con ella todos los d\u00edas. Su madre pas\u00f3 de piscar algod\u00f3n en el delta del Mississippi a obtener una beca para la Universidad Northwestern y obtener un doctorado con el tiempo mientras criaba a su familia. Pasar su infancia entre Mississippi y Evanston profundiz\u00f3 el amor de King por su cultura.King ha estado en comunidad durante mucho tiempo con otros l\u00edderes prominentes Negros de Chicago. Barack Obama es amigo desde hace mucho tiempo y compa\u00f1ero de baloncesto de su esposo (el abogado y DJ Chosen Few, Alan King), y el expresidente respald\u00f3 su candidatura a concejal en el 2017. Y antes de dedicarse a la pol\u00edtica, King ayud\u00f3 a establecer la Academia Comunitaria Ariel y fund\u00f3 Harriet\u2019s Daughters, un grupo llamado as\u00ed por Harriet Tubman que re\u00fane a mujeres Negras profesionales para aumentar el empleo y la riqueza en la comunidad.\u201cSiempre me ha gustado animar a nuestra comunidad\u201d, dijo a The TRiiBE, y se\u00f1al\u00f3 que, como concejal, defendi\u00f3 los esfuerzos para cambiar el nombre de las calles en honor a luminarias Negras como Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, el primer no ind\u00edgena de Chicago, y los periodistas Ida. B. Wells y Lerone Bennett Jr.\u00a0Como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos Negros a la alcald\u00eda del 2023, King invit\u00f3 a The TRiiBE el 10 de enero a su casa de Kenwood, a una cuadra de la mansi\u00f3n de un mill\u00f3n de d\u00f3lares de Louis Farrakhan. King se sent\u00f3 en un su sala en un sof\u00e1 hecho de piel, su casa estaba amueblada con un escritorio y acentuada por apreciadas obras literarias de escritores Negros como The 1619 Project de Nikole Hannah-Jones y Barracoon de Zora Neale Hurston, una pintura ind\u00edgena, otra que representa a hombres negros revolucionarios, y una escultura realizada por su padre biol\u00f3gico.\u201cSoy muy Afroc\u00e9ntrica. Orgullosa de quien soy. Mi madre es soci\u00f3loga. Tengo dos padres. Mi padre biol\u00f3gico, quien falleci\u00f3, su enfoque era el arte Afroamericano\u201d, dijo King. \u201cSiempre hay una diferencia de opini\u00f3n entre la gente acerca de qui\u00e9n piensan que soy. Creen que me conocen.Actualmente, King se desempe\u00f1a como presidente del Caucus de Reforma Progresista del Concejo Municipal y miembro del Caucus Negro Concejal de Chicago. Desde su nombramiento, por Rahm Emanuel, para el Concejo Municipal en el 2016, King ha sido copatrocinadora de m\u00faltiples iniciativas progresistas, incluida la Ordenanza Anjanette Young para prohibir las redadas policiales sin previo aviso, la Comisi\u00f3n Comunitaria de Seguridad P\u00fablica y Responsabilidad y la ordenanza Bring Home Chicago, y lider\u00f3 la campa\u00f1a de 2014 para aumentar el salario m\u00ednimo de Chicago a $15.Durante nuestra entrevista, King dijo que no cree en disminuir el presupuesto de la polic\u00eda de Chicago. Ella cree que una buena vigilancia funciona, y en su plan de seguridad p\u00fablica, eso significa redirigir los recursos a programas de vigilancia comunitaria, respuesta alternativa e intervenci\u00f3n contra la violencia, as\u00ed como poner m\u00e1s polic\u00edas en los vecindarios y \u201cadoptar\u201d la tecnolog\u00eda de vigilancia.Lea nuestra entrevista completa con King como parte de nuestra serie de entrevistas a candidatos a alcalde del 2023 Before the Polls, Antes de Votar en el 2023.(La entrevista ha sido editada y condensada para mayor claridad).\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 entr\u00f3 a la carrera por la alcald\u00eda este a\u00f1o? \u00bfY qu\u00e9 poder le dar\u00eda estar en la alcald\u00eda que no tenga ya como Concejal?Hay un n\u00famero de razones. Hay muchos desacuerdos entre la oficina del alcalde y la oficina de los maestros, la polic\u00eda, mis colegas; otro colega se fue ayer, creo que llegamos a 16. No es coincidencia. Simplemente hay mucha tensi\u00f3n.Trat\u00e9 muy temprano de hacer una conexi\u00f3n, porque quer\u00eda ver a una mujer afroamericana hacerlo bien, como, esa soy yo, parte de m\u00ed, \u00bfverdad? Pero, s\u00ed, la tensi\u00f3n contin\u00faa. Ser\u00eda negligente si no mencionara que este es uno de los per\u00edodos m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles en el pa\u00eds, en el mundo, con problemas sociales, con COVID. Y entonces tienes que reconocer eso y ponerlo en ese contexto, y lo hice.\u00a0Pero creo que el problema, y \u200b\u200bme tom\u00f3 un tiempo, es que, dada la inestabilidad y la inseguridad que todos sent\u00edan, era un momento en el que deber\u00edamos habernos unido como ciudad, y no lo hicimos. Y de nuevo, creo que eso es parte del liderazgo.\u00a0Y la otra raz\u00f3n es porque cuando vi a la gente ponerse de pie [para postularse para alcalde], no vi a alguien que pudiera representar a toda la ciudad mientras se duplicaba en nuestras comunidades.Represento [un distrito que se extiende] desde el centro de la ciudad hasta Hyde Park, y tengo a Bronzeville en el medio; lo llam\u00e1bamos Low End (de bajos recursos) mientras crec\u00edamos, ya sabes, es muy diverso. Tengo algunas de las personas m\u00e1s pobres. Tengo m\u00e1s hogares para personas mayores de CHA que probablemente cualquier otro distrito de la ciudad, pero tambi\u00e9n tengo parte del centro de la ciudad. Voy a Jackson Boulevard, Grant Park, Northerly Island, Soldier Field, Museum Campus, y tengo Hyde Park, que es una especie de epicentro de diversidad y equidad de la ciudad. Y luego tengo algunas de las partes m\u00e1s segregadas y m\u00e1s pobres con planes para sitios de transformaci\u00f3n. Tengo a Ida B. Wells, tengo Washington Park Corridor, tengo Lake Park, North Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Douglas. Tengo todas las casas de CHA. Puedo ver todo.La mayor\u00eda de los distritos son m\u00e1s contiguos, homog\u00e9neos y [compuestos por] personas similares, y eso es algo diferente; Tengo todas estas comunidades que son muy distintas y \u00fanicas a su manera. Pero tambi\u00e9n puedo ver esas similitudes.\u00a0Tengo dos distritos policiales diferentes; uno en el centro, otro en el sur. Puedo ver la cantidad desproporcionada de recursos que reciben al momemnto, puedo ver la cantidad desproporcionada de tasas de liquidaci\u00f3n. Pero tambi\u00e9n dirijo con equidad. Entonces, con nuestro dinero del concejal, Grand Boulevard obtiene la mayor parte de ese dinero porque es el \u00e1rea con menos recursos que tengo.\u00a0Veo la yuxtaposici\u00f3n de Historia de dos ciudades, como dir\u00eda la gente. Pero creo que eso me ayuda a comprender los desaf\u00edos que enfrentamos, as\u00ed como lo que funciona y lo que no.Y m\u00e1s espec\u00edficamente sobre el aspecto del poder. \u00bfQu\u00e9 poder obtendr\u00eda usted como alcaldesa en comparaci\u00f3n con el poder que ya tiene como Consejal?Esa es una gran pregunta. La diferencia es que, como concejal, paso todo mi tiempo abogando por los recursos que controla la oficina del alcalde en nombre de mis electores. Yo no tengo control sobre ello. Y no es que quiera tener el control, pero ciertamente quiero poder obtener esos recursos para mi comunidad.\u00a0En este distrito diverso, el crimen ha tocado lugares donde las personas con poder pueden opinar y est\u00e1n prestando atenci\u00f3n. He podido ver las diferencias y disparidades all\u00ed. Pero lo que no puedo hacer es controlar c\u00f3mo se distribuyen los oficiales de una manera m\u00e1s equitativa. Eso viene de la oficina del alcalde. Si no se recoge la basura, si no se quita la nieve, eso lo controla la alcald\u00eda. El poder est\u00e1 demasiado centralizado ahora. Necesitamos descentralizarlo para que la comunidad pueda sentir eso.\u00a0No hay raz\u00f3n por la que yo, como funcionario electo, no deba tener una mejor comunicaci\u00f3n con el alcalde. Compartimos constituyentes. Y entonces ese desaf\u00edo es un desaf\u00edo para nuestra ciudad, porque no hay forma de que ella pueda entender singularmente c\u00f3mo se siente cada comunidad. Y es por eso que el Concejo Municipal fue creado para ser un concejo fuerte y un alcalde d\u00e9bil, para que pueda equilibrar eso mejor. Y eso es lo que descubr\u00ed, que los desaf\u00edos que enfrento para ayudar realmente a mis residentes est\u00e1n en la oficina del alcalde. Y ah\u00ed es donde siento las diferencias.\u00a0Un concejal de la ciudad realmente tiene dos trabajos. Una es equilibrar un presupuesto cada a\u00f1o y legislar. Ahora, eso es probablemente el 10% de lo que realmente hago. El noventa por ciento es realmente abogar por, en nombre de, mis electores por sus necesidades, ya sea para vivienda, o ya sea, ya sabes, para programas de intervenci\u00f3n de violencia, o presencia policial, o inseguridades de personas sin hogar, o todas esas cosas.En octubre, dijo que podemos desplegar drones como socorristas, y que pueden perseguir a los delincuentes si es necesario, y que tambi\u00e9n podemos usar mejor otras tecnolog\u00edas, como ShotSpotter. Adem\u00e1s, su plan de seguridad de 10 puntos incluye el aumento inmediato de la presencia policial en la comunidad. Para ser honesta, gran parte de esto suena similar a los esfuerzos de las administraciones anteriores que han aumentado la vigilancia y la policia en las comunidades.\u00a0\u00a0\u00bfHay alguna evidencia que respalde que los elementos que destaca en su plan de seguridad de 10 puntos reducir\u00e1n efectivamente el crimen en Chicago?Para nuestra campa\u00f1a, el poder de \"y\" es realmente importante. Y as\u00ed, en el Plan de 10 puntos, uno de los puntos m\u00e1s importantes son varios cientos de millones de d\u00f3lares para la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia. Creo que eso es parte de eso. Si realmente lo lees, es un plan de reparaci\u00f3n racial del pueblo. Entonces, ya sabes, tener $600 a la semana para incentivar a nuestros [residentes] m\u00e1s vulnerables y a aquellos que probablemente recibir\u00e1n un disparo y recibir un disparo para ingresar al mercado legal y usar servicios integrales para complementar eso. Y, ya sabes, capacitaci\u00f3n laboral, creo que esa es la parte importante.Pero en realidad creo que la buena vigilancia funciona. Y es por eso que dije que podemos animar a la polic\u00eda y hacerla responsable, que no se excluyen mutuamente. He visto la evidencia de eso en mi propio distrito. Y tambi\u00e9n he visto la evidencia de la narrativa falsa de que no necesitamos [a la polic\u00eda] en nuestra comunidad. As\u00ed que d\u00e9jame explicarte. Son nuestras comunidades las que tienen las tasas de resoluci\u00f3n m\u00e1s bajas, es decir, los asesinatos sin resolver, los tiroteos sin resolver, todo sin resolver. Tambi\u00e9n son nuestras comunidades las que desproporcionadamente tienen menos polic\u00edas que los dem\u00e1s. Y lo entiendo. No es la \u00fanica soluci\u00f3n.\u00bfC\u00f3mo quieres financiar tu plan de 10 puntos?El estado tiene miles de millones del gobierno federal; la ciudad lo hace, tambi\u00e9n lo hace el condado, y todos est\u00e1n haciendo lo suyo para la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia. As\u00ed que tenemos que unirnos, juntar esos recursos. Comprometer\u00eda los $200 millones de la ciudad, obtendr\u00eda $50 millones del estado, obtendr\u00eda $50 millones de la industria privada.Aprovechemos esta oportunidad para hacer algo sobre [la violencia] de verdad esta vez. As\u00ed que vamos a poner dinero real para ello. Lo tenemos, y no lo tendremos en tres a\u00f1os. Pero deber\u00edamos decir que nuestro objetivo este a\u00f1o es impactar significativamente a 2,000 [residentes]. Luego, el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o, otros 2,000. Y despu\u00e9s de seis meses y un a\u00f1o, ser\u00e1n miembros productivos de nuestra comunidad, tendr\u00e1n un trabajo, por lo que finalmente se pagar\u00e1 solo. Pero el dinero de inmediato vendr\u00e1 de fondos federales que est\u00e1n aqu\u00ed. Demonios, yo recibi $85 millones para gastar que [Lightfoot] no gast\u00f3.Nosotros, como Concejo Municipal, dijimos que la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia es una prioridad. Aqu\u00ed hay $85 millones. Ella no lo gast\u00f3. Y eso tambi\u00e9n habla de los desacuerdos; hemos perdido mucho conocimiento institucional en la Ciudad, porque la gente se va. Hay tantas vacantes. Y por eso no es personal. Pero es dif\u00edcil para nosotros hacer avanzes a nuestra ciudad bajo este liderazgo, porque todos est\u00e1n frustrados, siguen adelante y no tiene sentido de unirnos como ciudad como, \"Est\u00e1 bien, sabemos que tenemos estos desaf\u00edos y problemas\", pero \u00bfc\u00f3mo lo hacemos juntos?\u00bfApoya la Ley SAFE-T?\u00bfApoyo la Ley SAFE-T? S\u00ed, creo que tienen algunos ajustes para [hacerle] . . . pero en general, si la apoyo.\u00bfApoya a GoodKids MadCity Peace Book o cualquier otra iniciativa fuera de la polic\u00eda para invertir en la seguridad de los vecindarios Negros de Chicago?S\u00ed lo apoyo. Les dije que necesitan modificar algunos de los problemas del presupuesto, pero las ideas de lo que est\u00e1n hablando, s\u00ed. Fui la primera en trabajar con GoodKids MadCity. Presentamos el Proyecto 1919 en torno a los disturbios raciales. Los reun\u00ed a ellos y al Dr. [Timuel] Black en torno a esa iniciativa.\u00a0Adem\u00e1s de vigilar, [en] la intervenci\u00f3n contra la violencia, mi recomendaci\u00f3n es $300 millones por a\u00f1o para hacer cambios y ver los problemas sist\u00e9micos a largo plazo para realmente unir a las personas y las comunidades. Y por cierto, eso deber\u00eda tener un impacto en la vivienda, en el trabajo, en todo tipo de cosas.\u00bfEso significa aumentar o disminuir el presupuesto policial para que esto suceda?No creo que el presupuesto policial deba reducirse en este momento. Solo te dir\u00e9 eso. Porque, en primer lugar, es dif\u00edcil saber si tenemos suficientes polic\u00edas o no. Pero s\u00e9 que no est\u00e1n en los lugares donde deben estar en el momento adecuado. S\u00e9 que hay una desproporci\u00f3n. Yo lo veo. Veo que mi distrito policial, que ten\u00eda m\u00e1s de 600 agentes, ahora tiene menos de 200. Y, por cierto, el Distrito 19, que no tiene casi [tantos] delitos, tiene m\u00e1s que el m\u00edo. Entonces, si tuvi\u00e9ramos que redistribuirlo, \u00bftendr\u00edamos suficiente? Tal vez.\u00a0Creo que eso es algo que necesito echarle un vistazo. Pero lo que veo en este momento es que los lugares que m\u00e1s lo necesitan no lo tienen, y deber\u00edan tenerlo en esas \u00e1reas. Veo c\u00f3mo lo hacen en el norte. Veo cu\u00e1ntos polic\u00edas hay para mitigar las cosas antes de que sucedan, para poder hablar con la comunidad mientras est\u00e1n all\u00ed para tener realmente esa relaci\u00f3n. Creo que eso es necesario antes de que las cosas se pongan mal. Entonces, para m\u00ed, hay dos cosas importantes. Est\u00e1n las respuestas alternativas a la vigilancia, as\u00ed como la intervenci\u00f3n de la violencia.\u00bfApoya Tratamiento No Trauma?Entonces se le llama todas estas cosas. As\u00ed que esos son los socorristas de salud mental, ese es el programa para el que obtuve dinero singularmente. Me asoci\u00e9 con la Concejal Rosanna Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez en eso, pero lo elev\u00e9 para d\u00e1rselo porque eso es lo que soy como l\u00edder.Lo apoy\u00e9 bajo Rahm cuando ning\u00fan otro concejal habl\u00f3 sobre recuperar eso. As\u00ed que estas no son cosas nuevas para m\u00ed. Son cosas que probablemente sean nuevas para el p\u00fablico, porque no me he dedicado a comercializar lo que hago, porque no lo hac\u00eda por eso. Estoy bien. No me importa qui\u00e9n recibe el cr\u00e9dito. S\u00f3lo tenemos que hacer esto. Necesitamos tener, ya sabes, socorristas de salud mental y el tratamiento que se deriva del trauma proviene de la reconstrucci\u00f3n de las cl\u00ednicas.La alcaldesa Lightfoot prometi\u00f3 una junta escolar electa, pero luego luch\u00f3 contra dicha junta. \u00bfApoyar\u00e1 una junta escolar electa? \u00bfY a qui\u00e9n pensar\u00eda en nombrar para el aspecto h\u00edbrido de la junta?No he pensado en a qui\u00e9n nombrar\u00eda. Pero los educadores son importantes. Ser\u00eda importante, ya sabes, encontrar personas que entiendan c\u00f3mo involucrar a los estudiantes desinteresados, porque eso es una gran parte. Adem\u00e1s, debemos llevar los oficios y la industria tecnol\u00f3gica a las escuelas. Y quiero dejar en claro que los programas de aprendices solo pueden acceder a ellos despu\u00e9s de graduarse, despu\u00e9s de cumplir 18 a\u00f1os, y generalmente est\u00e1n en los suburbios. Necesitan ser llevados a nuestras escuelas. As\u00ed que me gustar\u00eda alguien que realmente entienda la importancia de eso y de la industria tecnol\u00f3gica. Ciertamente quisiera personas que comprendan los impactos de la educaci\u00f3n en la comunidad de una manera muy profunda. Porque realmente, tenemos que traer m\u00e1s participaci\u00f3n o m\u00e1s programas extracurriculares.Idealmente creo que deber\u00eda haber sido m\u00e1s peque\u00f1o. Es un poco grande y dif\u00edcil de manejar. Pero es lo que va a ser ahora mismo. Pero ciertamente me gusta la parte elegida.Durante d\u00e9cadas, el alcalde ha estado en desacuerdo con el sindicato de maestros y muchos maestros, personal y estudiantes de base que se quejan de la falta de recursos y otros problemas importantes dentro de las escuelas. \u00bfCu\u00e1l cree que es la desconexi\u00f3n? \u00bfY cu\u00e1l ser\u00e1 su pol\u00edtica para mejorar CPS, especialmente en las comunidades Negras y Latine?Tengo una relaci\u00f3n con la CTU. Tengo relaci\u00f3n con la mayor\u00eda de los sindicatos. Probablemente dir\u00eda que soy la segunda opci\u00f3n de todos, lo cual est\u00e1 bien, porque demuestra que tengo esas relaciones. Creo que si no apoyaran a Brandon [Johnson], me apoyar\u00edan a m\u00ed. Pero mi punto m\u00e1s importante es que tengo esa relaci\u00f3n con ellos. Y continuar\u00e9 teniendo una relaci\u00f3n en la que puedan tener discusiones honestas sobre lo que est\u00e1 pasando con nuestros hijes y lo que es mejor para nuestros hijes.\u00a0Algunas de las grandes cosas en t\u00e9rminos de educaci\u00f3n ser\u00eda un modelo co-curricular. Y como vengo de la educaci\u00f3n, uso esa lengua vern\u00e1cula, pero en realidad es la programaci\u00f3n extracurricular, para hacer una escuela completa. Creo que eso es realmente importante. Creo que perdemos usar esta oportunidad para hacer eso realmente. Porque tienes estos beb\u00e9s peque\u00f1os que, ya sabes, despu\u00e9s de la escuela, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no podemos involucrarlos todav\u00eda? Entonces, los estudiantes desconectados son uno de los mayores obst\u00e1culos que enfrentamos.\u00a0Definitivamente [har\u00eda] un mejor uso del distrito de parques. No hay ninguna raz\u00f3n por la cual los estudiantes de secundaria no deber\u00edan participar all\u00ed. Esa es una oportunidad perdida.\u00a0Creo que es muy importante asegurarse de que no solo se introduzca a nuestros hijos a STEM a una edad muy temprana, sino que continuemos con eso a trav\u00e9s del mercado laboral y traigamos todas estas empresas y todas estas universidades, como Northwestern, University of Illinois, DePaul, UofC. Tenemos algunas de las mejores escuelas del pa\u00eds, no nos aprovechamos de eso.Hist\u00f3ricamente, hemos visto grandes compa\u00f1ias de desarrollo desplazar y borrar comunidades Negras en Chicago. La gente en las \u00e1reas que rodean la pr\u00f3xima biblioteca de Obama, por ejemplo, ya est\u00e1n viviendo algunos elementos de desplazamiento. \u00bfC\u00f3mo va a crear pol\u00edticas para apoyar a los residentes negros a quienes los nuevos desarrollos les est\u00e1n costando mucho, como el Centro Presidencial Obama?Ya he mostrado c\u00f3mo lo he hecho. Entonces, hay cuatro desarrollos sorprendentes en esta ciudad, la biblioteca Obama, las yardas 78 de Lincoln y el Hospital Michael Reese, y ya terminamos el desarrollo de Michael Reese. Est\u00e1 siendo anunciado por el New York Times como uno de los desarrollos m\u00e1s equitativos del pa\u00eds. Pero nunca escuchaste ninguna protesta. Nunca escuchamos sobre el desplazamiento ni nada de eso, porque formamos un Comit\u00e9 Asesor de Michael Reese. Trajimos a la mesa a personas que se preocupan por la vivienda, que se preocupan por todas estas cosas, y terminamos con un compromiso de $25 millones para la educaci\u00f3n de las escuelas. Terminamos con un 20 por ciento de viviendas asequibles en el lugar, lo cual es inaudito. Terminamos con un compromiso del 60 por ciento con la diversidad, en su mayor\u00eda afroamericanos porque est\u00e1 en Bronzeville, le cambiamos el nombre: de Michael Reese a Bronzeville Lakefront.Muchos de sus donantes pertenecen a la \u00e9lite profesional Negra de Chicago. Not\u00e9 que su esposo aport\u00f3 $50,000 para su campa\u00f1a. Seg\u00fan Illinois Sunshine. \u00bfC\u00f3mo rinde cuentas a las personas que han contribuido a su campa\u00f1a? \u00bfQu\u00e9 les prometio?Nunca prometas nada a nadie. He recibido contribuciones en los \u00faltimos seis a\u00f1os y medio de diferentes tipos de personas de diferentes \u00e1mbitos de la vida, y no miro las donaciones de esa manera. En primer lugar, es ilegal. Y en segundo lugar, simplemente soy un tipo de persona diferente. S\u00e9 cu\u00e1l es mi estrella polar, s\u00e9 por qu\u00e9 me met\u00ed en esto y s\u00e9 que no se trata de m\u00ed, ni de ning\u00fan beneficio personal o pol\u00edtico.Siempre me he concentrado en lo que es mejor para nuestra comunidad, y nuestra comunidad significa algo diferente para m\u00ed en t\u00e9rminos de la ciudad. Pero nuevamente, sigo pensando en mis antecedentes, ya sea en Evanston, Mississippi, todas esas cosas, cuando la gente habla de la Gran Migraci\u00f3n, yo viv\u00ed eso. Yo ten\u00eda un t\u00edo que tuvo que dejar el sur para ir a Nueva York, por miedo a que lo lincharan y cosas por el estilo. As\u00ed que es parte de lo que soy."

  "title": "How has Chicago\u2019s Aldermanic Black Caucus been representing the community?",
  "text": "Within the 50-person City Council, there\u2019s currently a bloc of 20 alders who make up the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC). Since its inception, the CABC\u2019s mission has been to work together closely to \u201crepresent the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities.\u201dHave they done that? Given the current state of Black Chicago as a whole, it\u2019s hard to say.\u00a0Chicago was once the business and political powerhouse of Black America. By 1980, it was home to nearly 1.2 million Black people (about 40 percent of the population). During what\u2019s now being referred to as a Black exodus of people and political power, that number has dropped below 29 percent today.Additionally, many of the predominantly Black wards that the CABC represents are struggling under continued divestment. In West Side neighborhoods such as North Lawndale, East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park and Austin, for example, poverty rates by household are some of the highest in the city: at 43 percent, 42 percent, 42 percent and 29 percent, respectively. In East and West Garfield parks, specifically, the median household income is $23,067 and $29,443, respectively; for the city as a whole, it\u2019s $62,907.The West Side is also disproportionately impacted by the criminal legal system. Between 2005 and 2009, Illinois spent $550 million on incarceration in Austin and $241 million in North Lawndale, according to Chicago\u2019s Million Dollar Blocks. During that same time, according to 2018\u2019s The War on Neighborhoods, 6,700 residents in the West Side\u2019s 60644 ZIP code were convicted and sentenced to prison; whereas 311 residents in neighboring Oak Park were sentenced to prison. At this time, the West Side is home to Cook County Jail, the CPD\u2019s Homan Square black site and the controversial $128-million police and training academy; the latter was highly touted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the academy\u2019s home alder, Emma Mitts (37th Ward) as a win that will spur more economic development in the area.The CABC is on the brink of a major shakeup this election season, with six of its members either stepping down, retiring or challenging Mayor Lori Lightfoot for her seat. The TRiiBE produced an accountability dashboard that takes a look at the voting records of each Black alder, dating back to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s tenure. The dashboard is the first of its kind in Chicago.To create it, we filed a public records request to the City Clerk for all votes made across all committees in the City Council. The clerk\u2019s office responded with 338,130 pages of PDF files that provided a partial picture of how alders have voted. We supplemented our analysis of those files with yearly divided vote reports compiled by former UIC political scientist Dick Simpson and data provided by Datamade to create this dashboard.The information presented here shows a slice of the hundreds of votes taken by members of the CABC over more than a decade. We chose to highlight ordinances that had a significant impact on, or particular relevance to, Black Chicagoans.For example, in March 2021, City Council voted to establish a guaranteed income pilot program that went into effect in July 2022, providing $500 per month to 5,000 low-income Chicagoans. In our dashboard, you\u2019ll find that the CABC did not vote unanimously on that measure. CABC chairman Ald. Jason Ervin (28th Ward) told the Sun-Times that those funds should be reallocated to violence prevention instead.In June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the City Council voted to temporarily ban evictions of renters who were unable to pay rent. Some of the CABC voted against that, too. According to Crain\u2019s Chicago Business, some alders believed the ordinance overly favored tenants."

  "text": "2023 Chicago mayoral candidate Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda endorsed Samie Martinez, a challenger to incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez (33rd Ward), a spokesperson for the campaign confirmed on Feb. 18. The endorsement puts Garc\u00eda in bed with allies of former Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s fiercest enemies, including former 33rd Ward Ald. Dick Mell. Garc\u00eda was once an ally in the City Council to Washington and frequently refers to that legacy as proof of his own progressive bona fides.Rodriguez is a member of the Socialist, Progressive Reform and Latino Caucuses. She was among a wave of progressives who were elected to City Council in 2019. She won the seat after defeating Deb Mell, who had been appointed to replace her father Dick Mell, who was the 33rd Ward alder from 1975 to 2013. Laith Shaban, an investment advisor and housing developer, is also challenging Rodriguez.\u00a0Along with progressive incumbent alders such as Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward), Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) and Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), Rodriguez has endorsed Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson for mayor. Johnson\u2019s progressive campaign has been the target of attacks from mayoral opponents Garc\u00eda, community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, State representative Kam Buckner and Mayor Lori Lightfoot in recent weeks as the commissioner has surged in polls.Samie Martinez, who is running on a law-and-order platform, is backed by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), former 12th Ward Ald. George Cardenas and Cook County Court clerk Iris Martinez (no relation to Samie). Samie Martinez was previously Cardenas\u2019s chief of staff.\u00a0Iris Martinez is also the 33rd Ward Democratic committeeperson, a chair formerly controlled by Dick Mell. Rodriguez has described her as an ally of Dick Mell.In the early 1980s, Dick Mell, along with Ald. Ed Burke and then-Ald. Ed Vrdolyak, led a bloc of white, machine alders who prevented then-Mayor Washington from advancing his legislative agenda during his first term. In an interview in the 2022 documentary Punch 9 For Harold Washington, Mell says, \u201cEverything Mayor Washington wanted to do, we blocked.\u201dIn addition to Samie Martinez, the FOP has endorsed a number of challengers to progressive alders and spent money heavily in aldermanic and Police District Council (PDC) races. Martinez and the police union hired the same election attorney, Perry Abbasi, who is himself an FOP-endorsed candidate for PDC in the 25th District, which lies just southwest of the 33rd Ward.The police union has endorsed incumbent alders Raymond Lopez (15th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Silvana Tabares (23rd Ward), Nicholas Sposato (38th Ward), Anthony Napolitano (41st Ward), and James Gardiner (45th Ward), none of whom are members of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\n        Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a coalition builder and progressive leader, but critics say he\u2019s making political decisions that conflict with today\u2019s movement.Samie Martinez has gotten donations from a number of people with ties to the old 33rd Ward Democratic machine, which Dick Mell controlled for nearly 40 years. Mary Hahne, who was formerly 33rd Ward treasurer and worked for Dick Mell\u2019s Legislative Reference Bureau, donated $2,500 to the campaign. Custom Companies, a transportation company owned by the ex-husband of Iris Martinez, donated $5,000.\u00a0Two of George Cardenas\u2019s committees donated a total of $5,000. A committee for Ald. Brian Hopkins, who is running unopposed for a third term as 2nd Ward alder, donated $5,000.A number of developers have donated to Samie Martinez\u2019s campaign. So have the Teamsters Local 705 ($2,500) and former Cinespace Studios CEO Alex Pissios ($5,000), who helped the FBI convict Teamsters president John Coli Sr. of taking bribes in 2022.Incumbent Ald. Rossana Rodriguez has been endorsed by a number of unions, including the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), Teamsters Local 700, SEIU Healthcare Illinois, AFSCME and the Illinois Nurses Association. United Working Families, Equality Illinois, LGBTQ Victory Fund, Mijente, the Democratic Socialists of America and Northside Democracy for America are among a slew of political organizations that have endorsed her as well.\u00a0Rodriguez has outraised Samie Martinez considerably, having garnered more than $250,000 from unions in this election cycle. The CTU, SEIU Healthcare Illinois and United Working Families have donated the most, giving $94,000, $88,261 and $27,077, respectively."

  "title": "Opinion: After another police killing in Chicago, we need to focus on care, not cops",
  "text": "When police take a life, a public-relations machine whirrs into motion. The goal of the subsequent press releases and media interviews is to cast whomever has been killed by a police bullet, car, or baton in an unsympathetic light. She may have been using drugs. He had an aggressive face. She was experiencing a mental health crisis. He had a gun. He ran. He had been arrested before. He was in a gang. Such well-worn lines serve a purpose: to keep the public from seeing the person and their family as victims deserving of rights, care, or mourning.We faced this machine again last week when Chicago police killed 21-year-old Isidro Valverde. One of us was his alderperson in Chicago\u2019s 33rd Ward and released a statement within hours of his death. In it, as we tried to confirm who had been shot and connect with the family in order to provide support, Valverde was referred to as a \u201cvictim\u201d of a shooting.\u00a0The backlash was swift. Police-adjacent actors launched a smear campaign against one of us\u2014an alderperson, now up for reelection, who has advocated for reallocating excessive police funding to building community-based care systems. Valverde was no victim, they insisted. Police seemed unable to tolerate the idea that he be mourned or that his family be provided support. After all, Valverde had shot at officers, they said, implying he deserved to die. As sad as this tired performance of self-righteous disregard for human life already was, there was something even more disturbing behind it.On February 7, Valverde went to a neighborhood bar near his home in the Irving Park neighborhood. He reportedly became intoxicated and stepped outside, where he got into a heated exchange. The security guard at the bar overheard and went to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Valverde pulled out a gun and pointed it at the security guard, who deescalated the situation. Valverde put his gun away and agreed to walk away. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it ended,\u201d the security guard told a reporter. This is how all such situations would ideally conclude\u2013\u2013with a community keeping itself safe through violence interruption and mediation.But a short time later, police arrived, responding to a call that a man had threatened bar patrons. Valverde was still nearby, and someone pointed him out to the police. Valverde, who had been arrested three times before for charges associated with drugs and fleeing from officers, took off running. The police gave chase. Valverde tripped in an alley. The officers shouted at him to stay down. When he began to try to get up, they shot him multiple times, killing him as he lay on the ground.The police chief claimed Isidro had shot at the two officers chasing him and that they had then returned fire, killing him in self-defense. In a press conference held hours after the shooting, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown stated that they had reviewed the body-cam footage and determined unequivocally that Valverde had shot at the officers.\u00a0This, it seems, was a lie. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which is responsible for investigating shootings involving police, independently reviewed the footage and found no evidence to corroborate Superintendent Brown\u2019s account. Furthermore, the police decision to run after Valverde appears to violate Chicago\u2019s no-chase law that went into effect last year after a series of avoidable, police-instigated violent encounters, such as the killings of 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 22-year-old Anthony Alvarez. This law prohibits officers from chasing after people simply because they\u2019ve run away or allegedly committed minor offenses. It was designed to prevent needless violence\u2013\u2013like Valverde\u2019s pointless, unnecessary death.It is well established that US police, including Chicago\u2019s during Superintendent Brown\u2019s tenure, sometimes falsify reports and disseminate misinformation after injuring or killing people in attempts to justify their actions and evade scrutiny. It has also been widely suspected that mayors, who oversee police departments and are eager to avoid negative media attention that might harm their personal careers, will participate in strategically distorting, delaying, and burying the truth. We are both advocates for non-police community safety systems and have long decried the harm inflicted on our communities when reactive police and incarceration systems are relied upon as substitutes for preventive support systems. After years of work in this arena, we would not be surprised if Superintendent Brown deliberately lied about Valverde\u2019s death. We are, after all, in the middle of a heated local election season in which police funding and accountability are major subjects of debate. Furthermore, the incumbent mayor upon whom Brown\u2019s career and legacy depends is falling behind in the polls.Superintendent Brown and anyone else\u2013\u2013including Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who has previously been accused of participating in cover-ups of police killings and misconduct\u2013\u2013who is found to have been involved in misleading the public about Valverde\u2019s death should be held accountable. This is not the first time that Superintendent Brown has given what appear to be misleading statements about police violence and it\u2019s particularly egregious that he continues to do so in the context of a consent decree that continues to lag far behind in its implementation.\u00a0This decree was issued after the United States Department of Justice concluded a year-long civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Laquan Macdonald by a police officer in 2014. It mandates via court order that the CPD complete a series of reforms to confront over 50 years of repeated failures to act lawfully and to treat Chicago residents\u2013\u2013regardless of race or class\u2013\u2013equally under the law. To date, the CPD under Superintendent Brown and Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s supervision has repeatedly failed to meet the deadlines for reform stipulated by the decree, which, as a result, has been extended by an additional three years. This slow rate of change has persisted despite a ballooning Chicago police budget, which now exceeds $1.94 billion per year.\u00a0In this context, we have been joined by colleagues in an open letter calling for Superintendent Brown\u2019s resignation. But while we believe he is unfit to lead CPD, his departure alone will do little to reverse the rippling effects of Valverde\u2019s death. By opposing our efforts to care for Valverde\u2019s family in the immediate wake of his killing and by intimidating community members into withholding support, the police machine under Brown didn\u2019t just kill Valverde. It followed up to inflict yet further trauma upon his family, friends, and neighborhood by rushing to discredit Valverde, isolate his family, and divide rather than unite his community.When the police take the life of one of our neighbors, the consequences reverberate throughout communities and across generations. It tears open old wounds for many of us who have lost loved ones to gun violence, had family members abused or intimidated by police, or who struggle to trust our own communities because of the lack of safety that decades of failed police-centric safety policies have left us.\u00a0This is why it is so important to be able to respond to traumatic events like Valverde\u2019s death\u2013\u2013which joins thousands of recent police shootings\u2013\u2013by coming together as a community to mourn, support those most affected, and begin the process of collective repair and organizing for the policy changes we need to build stronger, safer communities. Without that, experiences of loss at the hands of police perpetuate cycles of injury, distrust, poverty, despair, anger, and violence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Police reforms are overdue, but they cannot heal the harm that police violence has wrought on the families and communities who have suffered from it. To heal our communities, we need to invest in building systems for shared safety based in supportive care that builds trust rather than encourage retribution\u2013\u2013that is, non-police safety systems like the community health and justice worker corps one of us outlined in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.Safe communities are not those that are most policed but rather places where our government treats each resident\u2013\u2013and residents, in turn, treat one another\u2013\u2013with compassion and care enabled by public infrastructures designed to protect everyone rather than just the privileged few. As Chicago prepares to elect its alders and next mayor, we should be asking how they plan to protect our communities\u2013\u2013including when that requires standing up to police."

  "text": "Everyone that I know and respect who works in school buildings always goes above and beyond for the students. We want to give our students every great school experience that we can. We try not to, but we think about lesson plans, grading and how to better connect with our students when we aren\u2019t even at school, on weeknights and weekends. We dwell on that one kid who we haven\u2019t been able to reach yet and think of ways to connect with them, to engage them in our class.So how does an educator even begin to cope when a desk that was once filled by a student that we knew and built relationships with goes empty because that young person is no longer alive. How do we cope when we taught and mentored a student and saw them graduate only to see on social media that their life is over?These are things that we are never taught and there is no support for in our school systems across the country. In Chicago, our schools are already criminally short on social workers and counselors. We went on strike in 2019 for eleven days in part so we could make sure every Chicago Public School had a social worker by 2024. The National Association of Social Workers says schools that are experiencing high levels of trauma should have one social worker for every 50 students.\u00a0In Chicago, because of the 2019 strike we have one social worker for every 520 students! Chicago Public Schools has four crisis counselors for over 340,000 students. As I have learned through the deaths of my own students, these four crisis counselors go to a school to try to help the students dealing with the loss of a classmate and friend. The crisis counselors come for a day and then leave, but that school\u2019s staff is supposed to pick up the pieces after that, with no additional sustained support.The first student I ever lost passed away on a cold January night in 2011. My assistant principal called me early the next morning to tell me that Trevell was killed. I taught him as a freshman in 2007; the first ever class of students that I taught.\u00a0I remember Trevell giving a speech in my class about the need for Black-owned businesses in Woodlawn and Englewood. When Trevell was killed as a senior, he was preparing to head to college. I remember going to school and worrying more about my students and how to make sure they were okay. I \u2014 and every adult in the building \u2014 tried to be their therapist and support while ignoring our own pain. That is a cycle that is repeated time and time again in school buildings across this city, every time a student dies.Since then, I keep a list of students\u2019 names in my phone who I taught that have died. That list continues to grow. It\u2019s now at 22. These are the students I taught and talked to daily, who I cared for, was playfully annoyed by and loved deeply.\u00a0These students are no longer here because of intra-communal violence, police violence and tragic accidents. In my head, when the number of students on the list on my phone would climb, I would start to get anxious. As it approached ten student deaths, I said to myself, \u201cI am not sure how I will react if I ever have ten students die.\u201d Ten deaths came, nothing changed; students, staff and families still grieved, but the trauma of loss compounded.\u00a0For the past 16 years, I\u2019ve honestly tried not to think about these losses, let alone talk about them, because if I bring them up, the emotions overwhelm me. It is like a fog rests on my brain. After many losses and much encouragement, I hesitantly started seeing a therapist because of student loss. I sat for an hour not wanting to tell my therapist about why I was even there because it was so painful.\u00a0I\u2019ve also been hesitant to talk about student loss publicly because I didn\u2019t feel worthy of the deep pain I felt for them; these students had families and loved ones that were experiencing the loss much more profoundly than I was. I also worried about people commenting horrible things about my students if I shared my grief for them publicly. I have grown used to criticism and trolls hating on teachers, but when people blame my students for their own deaths, that hits different.\u00a0The cycle of violence and trauma continues, prayers are given and children are blamed. Children are blamed for being with the wrong people or making the wrong choices. There are no \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d kids. They are just kids. We must break the habit of trying to justify how sad we should feel when a student dies, depending on their goodness level. It is as if when a kid who has all the support that they need dies, then we should feel sadder than when a kid who should be getting more support dies. It is as if a child\u2019s struggle absolves us of the same level of sadness. Violence and tragedy have become so normalized in our city and society that many immediately try to determine if the life that was lost essentially \u201cdeserved\u201d it.\n        With the overwhelming support of Treatment Not Trauma, our ask is to redistribute unused Chicago Police funds to reopen mental health centers.Everytime a student has died in this city, the mayor \u2014 whether it be Daley, Rahm or Lightfoot \u2014 has said how sad they are and sent their prayers, but we need more counselors, social workers and mental-health providers for the students in our schools. Educators have been demanding an increase in those supports since I started teaching in 2007. Officials are not developing policies to help create safer communities for our kids to live and thrive in.\u00a0The situation has not improved since we lost Trevell. Students are still being killed, as we have seen this year, sometimes right outside the schools they attend.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want educators who have never experienced student loss to have to experience this. I want our students to be safe and I want politicians who will actually invest in neighborhoods, with job creation and youth activities, and invest resources into our schools for mental health services for our students, not more police.For me, when any young person in this city dies, I instantly start to think about each and every student\u2019s empty desk in my classroom.\u00a0 I think about the balloon releases,\u00a0 social media posts and funerals. I worry about losing more. I worry about my colleagues across the city, teaching through the trauma caused by the loss of students.\u00a0The trauma of student loss makes me not only remember the students who I have lost but also tragically makes me afraid to lose the students who are in front of me. Through therapy, I have realized that I started to put distance between myself and students needing more support because I was picturing losing them and trying not to get attached. Honestly, this is likely the reason that I left other schools that I have worked at, because the likelihood of experiencing loss and more trauma was too high. My own therapy has kept me in the profession. I have learned how to work through the pain with a trained professional. Without therapy, I would be a distant father and spouse as the grief would consume me at times, and I likely would not be teaching.What do educators do to survive this pain? What do we do when we are grieving but trying to be strong for our students, while at the same time, trying not to let ourselves picture losing the students in front of us too?\u00a0In addition to the tragedies at Michele Clark and Benito Juarez high schools in 2022, my school experienced losing a student. I didn\u2019t know this student personally, but hearing about his death made me think of every student who I had lost. Kanye, the student from Kenwood, was killed at the gas station where I used to get our family van repaired, at the corner where my partner and I lived during our first six years in the neighborhood, at the corner where my mom walks daily and the corner where our students buy snacks after school. A normal corner, outside a high school.\u00a0I don\u2019t want this or the next generation of teachers to have to figure out the coping mechanisms that I\u2019ve learned. I don\u2019t want this or the generation of students to fear just existing. We shouldn\u2019t be experiencing loss in our schools or our communities. We should see politicians writing policy on the local and national level to create jobs, fund after-school programs, and at least double the required recommendations for counselors, psychologists and social workers in schools. We need to stop relying on teachers to counsel our students, and hire the trained experts.\u00a0Every single student and staff member in our schools should be getting more support so we aren\u2019t forced to fight this normalized violence and trauma alone. I\u2019m thankful that the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) is and has been fighting for wraparound services for our students and schools. Alder Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward) has written policy so that Chicagoans can get treatment, not more trauma.\u00a0 I am thankful to organizations such as GoodKids MadCity that have concrete proposals like the Peace Book Ordinance to provide resources and plans to establish the practice of peace."

  "text": "Daley joins The TRiiBE after a year at the Chicago Reader, where he edited more than 150 stories, oversaw more than a dozen investigations, produced the first-ever voter guide to Chicago\u2019s Police District Council races, restructured the alternative paper\u2019s news and commentary sections, started the first column in a Chicago newspaper by an incarcerated writer and managed partnerships with several community outlets, including The TRiiBE.He can be reached at jim@thetriibe.com.\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be joining this team of such talented journalists,\u201d Daley said. \u201cI have long admired The TRiiBE\u2019s editorial vision, and the partnerships we\u2019ve built together have been extremely rewarding. I\u2019m really grateful for the chance to be a part of such an outstanding organization.\u201dThe TRiiBE launched in 2017 with a vision to reshape the narrative of Black Chicago through innovative and solutions-driven journalism.At The TRiiBE, Daley will work closely with editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden, multimedia reporter Tonia Hill, social media producer Tyger Ligon and a network of freelance contributors.Daley has been a close friend and collaborator of The TRiiBE since 2020. He guest edited The TRiiBE\u2019s midterm anniversary interview with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and has co-published multiple stories with The TRiiBE, including political coverage and investigations of the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s electronic monitoring program.\u201cIt\u2019s been a joy working with Jim in a collaborative capacity for the past two years. Needless to say, I am beyond thrilled for him to join our TRiiBE team,\u201d editor-in-chief Tiffany Walden said. \u201cJim is a brilliant mind who is passionate about uplifting marginalized voices and exposing systemic ills that continue to keep Chicago\u2019s Black and brown communities overpoliced and in high rates of poverty. His track record as a tenacious reporter speaks for itself. I\u2019m confident that he will be a dynamic force on The TRiiBE\u2019s editorial team, and will help take our news coverage to the next level.\u201dPrior to joining the Chicago Reader, Daley worked as the politics editor and interim managing editor for South Side Weekly. During his tenure, the community newspaper won a Peter Lisagor award for its June 2020 issue, \u201cChicago Reacts to the Killing of George Floyd,\u201d and another for his investigation into the Chicago police\u2019s use of the city\u2019s gun-violence prevention center and CPD\u2019s press office to surveil political protestors."

  "title": "Is Chuy out of step with the progressive movement? Black and brown leaders weigh in",
  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "text": "This story was co-published with the Chicago Reader.At a forum on Police District Council races hosted on January 22 by the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) at CTU headquarters, dozens of candidates stood in lines that wrapped around a dais at the front of Jacqueline Vaughn Hall, waiting their turn to explain why they\u2019re running.\u00a0Nearly all of them are seeking office for the first time in their lives, but they spoke clearly and with conviction about the trauma they\u2019ve experienced at the hands of police.Many have family members who were brutalized or killed: Cynthia McFadden\u2019s father escaped white supremacist terror in the South by coming to Chicago during the Great Migration, only to be shot and killed by police at 47th and King Drive on the day he arrived. Coston Plummer\u2019s older brother was tortured for 39 hours and forced to falsely confess to murder by officers under notorious commander Jon Burge when he was just 15 years old, and remains in prison today. When Craig Carrington\u2019s sister was brutalized and arrested for protecting her children from police in 2004, he promised her that if he ever could, he would do something about it.They talked about running for Police District Council in order to heal\u2014not just themselves and their families, but entire communities whose relationships with public safety have long been fractured.\u201cThe amazing thing about these candidates who are running for district council is that they are overwhelmingly Black and Brown, overwhelmingly working class, and there\u2019s also a lot of poor people in the ranks,\u201d Frank Chapman, a CAARPR field organizer and a leader of the movement that ushered in the Police District Councils, told the crowd. \u201cThis is who is running. So just on the basis of that, this election on February 28 will be the most democratic election that this city has ever seen.\u201d\u00a0Of the 112 candidates running in the newly-created Police District Council races, 63 used resources provided by CAARPR to file election paperwork. These 63 candidates support police accountability: overwhelmingly, they want Chicago Police Department funding to be redirected to violence prevention and transformative justice programs, for care workers to accompany police to mental health crises, and for their churches, block clubs, and community organizations to be included in public safety. Despite what they have personally endured at the hands of police, only a few want to totally defund or abolish CPD.They described knocking on countless doors in Chicago\u2019s coldest months to discuss that opportunity with voters. Meridth Hammer, a candidate in the Fourth District, was hoarse from talking about public safety with voters day in and day out. They are ordinary people whose resilience carries them as they fight for a seat at the table.Ordinary people have always been at the center of this struggle. The movement for community control of the police, or CCOP, was led by revolutionaries, but it has always been carried onward by neighborhood people.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.In Chicago, CCOP was first conceived by the Black Panther Party and Chairman Fred Hampton in the 1960s. A charismatic visionary, Chairman Fred built a Rainbow Coalition of Black, Brown, and working-class white residents who, fed up with police violence, gentrification, and not-so-benign neglect of their communities, became revolutionaries.\u00a0Neutralizing revolutionary coalitions was at the top of the FBI\u2019s list of COINTELPRO goals, and the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Office and Chicago Police Department conspired to assassinate Hampton on December 4, 1969. His murder only spurred the Panthers and Rainbow Coalition to redouble their efforts for control of police. Within four years, they built a citywide campaign for elected civilian police boards in every police district. Ultimately, Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s political machine repelled the effort. The movement regrouped and found other inroads to power as revolutionaries ran for office.\u00a0Over the ensuing decades, elected officials made several attempts to establish oversight of the police. Following a series of police brutality incidents, U.S. representative Ralph Metcalfe (IL-1) convened a Congressional blue-ribbon panel in 1972 that led to the creation of the Office of Professional Standards (OPS). Comprised of civilian members of CPD, it became notorious for stifling misconduct investigations. After a brutality incident was caught on camera in 2007, the City Council voted (with Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s approval) to replace OPS with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). Moving oversight out of the department did little to increase accountability. Following the CPD murder of Laquan McDonald, the City Council (with Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s blessing) replaced IPRA with the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates misconduct and makes recommendations to the Police Board, in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through it all, Chicago police continued killing and brutalizing people. The victims\u2019 families never stopped fighting for justice. Many have been doing so for decades, often on their own, wandering the wilderness of a city that took police harassment, torture, and murder of its residents for granted. The best most could hope for was a cash settlement. The price of police violence was shunted onto Chicago\u2019s residents as the City\u2019s payouts for police misconduct ballooned to more than $50 million a year.In 2012, one police killing, of Rekia Boyd by off-duty CPD officer Dante Servin, became a flashpoint around which the scattered survivors of police violence coalesced. The Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) spent a decade painstakingly building a movement rooted in the communities. In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set off rebellions around the country. Amid the uprisings, GAPA and CAARPR formed a coalition and, with their allies in City Council, passed the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance in 2021 despite Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s objections.The district councils that the ECPS ordinance created will not have the kind of direct oversight powers the Panthers initially sought for district-level boards in the CCOP movement, like hiring and firing police and setting department policy. However, they will have the right to engage with district commanders and recommend restorative justice and other alternative approaches to safety. Among other duties, they\u2019re also charged with helping community members request investigative information from COPA and CPD. The councils\u2019 effectiveness at serving and engaging with the community will most likely vary by district.\u00a0Each of the 22 three-member councils will send one representative to meetings where they will nominate the citywide Community Commission on Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA). It is in that commission that ECPS achieves civilian power\u2014in a layered, not direct, manner\u2014over the degree to which police are held accountable. The CCPSA can hire and fire the chief administrator of COPA. It can also hold hearings about the police superintendent and take a vote of no confidence that triggers City Council hearings and a vote to retain or fire the superintendent.\u00a0The hope of the ECPS organizers is that the CCPSA will exercise these powers should COPA or the superintendent fail to hold officers who brutalize or kill accountable.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her allies initially resisted the proposals brought forth by organizers, and it took grueling negotiations between organizers and the mayor\u2019s office before the City Council passed the ECPS ordinance. Then, the mayor and her allies slow-walked its implementation. Lightfoot\u2019s floor leader, Alderperson Michelle Harris, delayed the opening of applications for the interim CCPSA for months. And although the ECPS ordinance required the mayor to appoint members to the interim CCPSA by January 2022, she waited until August to do so. At that point, it was too late for the CCPSA to review the mayor\u2019s police department budget and recommend changes to the City Council, one of their key duties mandated by the ordinance.\u00a0The police are aware of the ramifications of reform. Just as the machine poured its efforts into thwarting the CCOP ordinance 50 years ago, the Fraternal Order of Police and its allies have organized to undermine ECPS.\u00a0The FOP has spent at least $25,000 to get their people on the ballot and try to knock progressive candidates off, and they gave the green light to one of their election attorneys, Perry Abbasi, to run in the 25th District. In Northwest-Side districts like the 16th and Southwest-Side districts like the 22nd, where neighborhoods like Galewood and Mount Greenwood are home to many police, nearly everyone running has ties to the FOP.\u00a0In the Fifth District, Thomas McMahon, a former police lieutenant who has 21 misconduct allegations, is running. He hired his own attorney to challenge the ballot petitions of Robert McKay, a candidate in the same district who helped usher in reform to the CFD in the 1990s; the reformer is now running as a write-in candidate. Lee Bielecki, a retired sergeant who has 26 allegations of misconduct, is running in the 22nd District. In the 12th, Juan Lopez, a former state police trooper who was fired and charged with seven felonies for firing six shots into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home after seeing her with another man, is running. Lopez was acquitted of the felonies, for which he was facing 26 years in prison, and convicted of a misdemeanor.\u00a0But the block club members, teachers, and pastors who stood at the microphones at CTU headquarters know the stakes of this race better than anyone. They want the opportunity to ensure that the radical proposition they fought for and won\u2014a chance for the community to have a say in creating public safety and holding police accountable\u2014is borne out. According to Chapman, that opportunity is revolutionary.\u201cThese people are running out of dedication to a cause,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cAnd their dedication is that it\u2019s time, in this city, to hold the police accountable for the crimes that they commit against that community.\u201d For these candidates, it is time indeed.

  "text": "This story was originally published by The Chicago Reader & South Side WeeklyAfter decades of struggle by thousands of people who organized, marched, petitioned, prayed, and collectively clamored for the right to have a say in how their communities are policed, on February 28 voters will elect 66 people to serve on police district councils across the city.The battle for community control of the police has been waged for more than a half-century. Deputy chairman Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party sparked the first push in the late 1960s (see\u00a0Fifty years of struggle). In the decades since, organizers have won incremental concessions. The Office of Professional Standards was created within the police department in 1974. It was replaced by the Independent Police Review Authority in 2007, which was in turn replaced by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability a decade later. Each agency was created thanks to the tireless efforts of ordinary Chicagoans. None of the people serving on them were democratically elected.\u00a0The police district councils will be elected. Three councilors will serve in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts for four-year terms. They\u2019ll be tasked with building connections between police and communities, developing community policing initiatives, getting community input on CPD policies, and ensuring the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) hears the community\u2019s concerns.The Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that created the councils and the CCPSA is the result of\u00a0 a decade of organizing spurred by the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd by Dante Servin, an off-duty police detective, in Douglass Park. Servin, found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter because the judge determined he\u2019d shot Boyd intentionally, resigned from the department with a pension. In response to that killing, organizers began the push for community control of police anew.In the ensuing years, as high-profile killings by police across the country mounted, they catalyzed the Black Lives Matter movement, a nationwide effort to get government officials to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stem the epidemic of violence wrought upon Black and Brown communities by the very officers tasked with keeping them safe. In Chicago and elsewhere, the police kept killing people. The victims were often unarmed, and they were almost always Black.\u00a0In 2014, then-officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him. When video footage of the shooting was released, thousands of Chicagoans protested downtown, shutting down the Magnificent Mile during Black Friday and staging a sit-in at the office of State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez, who activists said had mishandled the prosecutions of both Van Dyke and Servin. In the wake of the protests, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, and the U.S. Department of Justice placed the CPD under a federal consent decree.Everything changed in 2020, as protests of the murder of George Floyd by then-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin swept the nation.\u00a0In Chicago and elsewhere, the rebellions (and the police response to them) turned into a long, hot summer. In its midst, the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression formed a coalition, Empowering Communities for Public Safety. With thousands of ordinary people at its back and in the streets, the coalition negotiated the language of the ECPS ordinance with the mayor. It passed in 2021.Chicagoans have been promised police reform before, and the department\u2019s entrenched attitude against change could make some wonder how effective the district councils will be. One clue to the power they may wield lies in who\u2019s on the ballot. In addition to ordinary residents and dedicated activists, several candidates with law enforcement ties are running. And the Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s election attorney filed challenges to several progressive candidates\u2019 ballot petitions, is listed as the contact person for six more on Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (CBEC) filings, and is himself running.\u00a0We\u00a0sent questionnaires to district council candidates, interviewed as many as we could reach, and researched their backgrounds using sources ranging from social media to biographies compiled by the ECPS coalition. We\u2019ve compiled the responses below. Early voting begins on January 26 at the CBEC supersite, and on February 13 in all 50 wards.\u00a0\u2014Jim DaleyAn attorney, Brown graduated from the Catholic University of America and Columbus School of Law.

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Kam Buckner",
  "text": "Kam Buckner wants to remind everyone that he is a son of Chicago. His family has roots in Mississippi; they moved to Chicago during the second Great Migration after the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in nearby Money, Mississippi. Buckner, 37, is a graduate of Chicago Public Schools, and boasts being the only candidate in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race who can claim that honor \u2014 he went to Clissold Elementary School in Beverly and then Morgan Park High School.As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, on Jan. 2 Buckner invited The TRiiBE to his campaign office inside the shopping center off 55th and Wentworth Avenue in Washington Park. He noted that the area was hit badly during the 2020 summer uprisings.\u201cIn May 2020, after the death of George Floyd and when social unrest began to gin up around the country, specifically here in Chicago, we know that many of the shopping centers around the city were boarded up,\u201d Buckner said, directing his attention to the mural painted on the piece of plywood behind him inside the office. \u201cBut then we also saw an influx of many Chicago artists being able to use the plywood as an expressive way to tell their stories as well. It was some beautiful artwork around the city.\u201dDuring the interview, Buckner didn\u2019t linger on the fact that his father was a longtime Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Department officer, and that he has an uncle who was a sworn CPD officer and another uncle who was a CPD civilian employee. Instead, he highlighted his work as a state representative to bring the SAFE-T Act and Chicago\u2019s first-ever elected school board to fruition. We also asked him about his plans for policing and public safety should he become mayor.\u00a0Throughout our interview, he was adamant about not increasing CPD\u2019s budget if elected. However, he did talk about filling existing vacancies within CPD and finding resources to put more detectives on the streets.Read our full interview with Buckner below, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: How does your environment growing up shape your politics and who you are and your outlook on life today?Kam Buckner: I talk a lot in this campaign about being a son of Chicago. And to me, that's a big deal, right? We could talk about where you go to college and went to law school and all that fun stuff. That's resume-based stuff. But literally being a person who grew up here, who is a Chicago Public School graduate, a person who played in Chicago parks and went to summer camp in Chicago parks and was an early and young utilizer of Chicago Public Library. Chicago really is in my DNA. It\u2019s at the core of who I am.And when I talk about the reason I'm running for mayor, when I talk about the space that I find myself in today, it really is based on what I feel this city has been able to give me and my family. My mother moved here from Mississippi in 1955. She actually moved here in September of 1955. And the reason that she came here was that in August of 1955, Emmett Till was murdered in the town that was next door to hers. And so when my grandmother and my grandfather heard about this little Black boy from Chicago, who came down to Mississippi and was mutilated, was lynched, was tortured for no other reason than the color of his skin, honestly, they had had enough, right. My mother grew up seeing lynchings. She grew up dealing with the things that were central to Jim Crow. But that was the final straw for my grandparents. And so they packed the girls up and made the trek to Chicago for safety and for opportunity. And so I always remind myself that that's how I got here, because it's how my family got here.You pled guilty to a second DUI earlier this year, and said that it taught you a lesson. What lesson did you learn from the second one? And what does it say about you as a role model for young Black Chicagoans?I've been very open and transparent about my past mistakes and my missteps. I've taken responsibility and accountability for them. I've had the conversations about this publicly with my constituents, with my God and my spiritual team and my family. And in the four years that have occurred since the second incident happened, the people of the 26th District have reelected me or have voted for me in four different elections since then.The Speaker of the House has asked me twice to be a part of his leadership team. The Black Caucus has asked me to chair them, which I did through some very tough times in 2020. And I'm ending my chairmanship in 10 days here. And so I think it's very clear that I've become a better person since then.A lot has happened personally for me since then; got married. I\u2019m a father now. And so I think that what I want to convey to young, especially young Black Chicagoans is that mistakes and missteps don\u2019t have to be your demise, right? We all make mistakes, and we\u2019re fortunate [to] learn from them. And we\u2019re able to impart wisdom on other folks and show people that you may be down but you\u2019re not out.You grew up with a very law enforcement-heavy family. You've said that you support both GoodKid MadCity's Peace Book proposal, and an increase in the size of\u00a0 the police force. What parts of the Peace Book do you support? And how does that work with your plan to increase the police force?My dad was actually [in] Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Department. My uncles were CPD, both sworn officers and civilian employees as well. And so not only do I support the Peace Book, but I actually worked with GoodKids MadCity to write the state counterpart to that: the Peace Act. It basically takes the work that is in the Peace Book ordinance and expands it to every single police department in the state.When I talk about filling vacancies, I don\u2019t talk about increasing the size of CPD. I talk about vacancies that already exist, but I also talk about civilianization of many functions. I also talk about, not a call-responder model for mental health calls like currently exists, but a model where cops are not showing up at all \u2014 where it\u2019s only a trained mental health professional. I think that's all that's important to be able to bring the city forward.Increasing the size of the police department is not the recipe for this. What I often talk about is two things. I see public security and I see public safety. I think public security is law enforcement. I think law enforcement has to exist for when untoward things happen, and we need a response to that. Law enforcement is responsive.I unfortunately have seen numerous times in my family where people have been victimized. My uncle who I was talking about earlier, who's a CPD civilian employee, he worked in the equipment space down at the headquarters on 35th Street. And in 2016, was shot to death, taking groceries out of his car in the Morgan Park neighborhood where I grew up at. And I remember the process of going through the process with the detectives on finding who did it. It happened to be a young man\u2014I think he was 16 at the time, shooting across the street at another young man and my uncle errantly got hit. But these stories are too real. And they're everyday stories in the city. And so once again, I think we need to have an apparatus that is able to respond when these things happen. But also, we got to be preventative and proactive and give people what they need to be safe and to feel safe.When you say you supported GoodKids MadCity and like the drafting of the Peace Book, will you implement the Peace Book?Absolutely. Two of the things that should be the first few bullet points in my public safety plan. The Peace Book ordinance, I will implement it. I will work on getting that done day one, and the Anjanette Young ordinance as well.Organizers have called for more mental health and preventative measures to counteract some of the violence that we see. So we've had that conversation a lot of times. Leaders have had this conversation a lot of times, but then when people get in office, we don't see that. We still see the police budget increase. There are calls to have more police out on the street. Do you have any policies that you are thinking about crafting or have already crafted that really show what these two institutions could look like; this idea of preventative measures and policing? When you mentioned police responding to certain crimes, what crimes? How does that work?I think you're right. I think we, especially with this current mayor, I\u2019ll just call it what it is. We were sold a bill of goods. And once she was sworn in, almost immediately she backpedaled on so many things that many of us were excited about in the city. And it's disappointing, to say the least. But as I've said many times on this campaign trail, politicians make promises, the leaders keep them, which this mayor has failed to do. And so we got to hold her accountable for that.\u00a0In my public safety plan, which is called Safer 77, being a nod to the 77 communities in Chicago, I talk a lot about making sure that CPD can not be laser-focused on petty crimes, I mean crimes that are smaller and nonviolent. We've got a 20% clearance rate on homicides. No matter where you fall on this conversation, there's nobody who tells me that they're okay with an 80% chance of killing somebody in Chicago and never having to pay for it. That's problematic.\u00a0So, in my plan, I talk a lot about providing resources to put more detectives in the streets. These are not somebody that's pulling you over for an expired tag and then busting you for having some weed in your car.When you say more detectives in the streets, it does sound like more policing.Yes. No, absolutely. When I sit down with families in my state rep district, specifically families who have lost young people, they want more detectives. Once again, detectives aren\u2019t cops who \u2018gon lock folks up. They\u2019re not banging on your door. They\u2019re solving crimes and solving murders specifically.\u00a0Two Labor Days ago, there was a [4-year-old boy] named [Mychael] \u201cMJ\u201d Moultry Jr. and he was killed in my district, in fact, killed across the street from a park that\u2019s named after Emmett Till\u2019s mother. Right. And I talked to his parents a lot.I talked to them over this holiday break, just to check in on them because I know it was tough for them. And when I talk to people like that, and they have no answers on their son\u2019s death, no answers. The mayor came out and did some dog-and-pony press conference. But then the calls from CPD stopped. And it\u2019s because they said they don\u2019t have the manpower to do it. That\u2019s a huge failure to me.I don't want to increase the police state. I don't think that we should be flooding our streets with more officers to police in an unconstitutional way. I think we got some real issues. You read the consent decree, you'll see that we've got a long way to go. But what I do think is that we need to start bringing some closure and some solace to the families in the city who have been victims of violence, specifically, like I said, for young people. If I told you how much time I spent talking to parents who have lost their children, it's a really damning indictment on where we have gone as a society.Your language gives law and order. On first impression, it reads like you\u2019re a pro-cop candidate. And for our audience who may be trying to decide who is the most progressive candidate, I think they need a little bit more information about what your investment in policing is going to be. You mentioned detectives. Is there anything else? When it comes to the police budget, can you get specific about moving numbers around?For me, when I talk about being able to provide both safety and justice, it is making sure that the CPD budget isn\u2019t once again putting more officers in the street to occupy our communities. That is not the way to go. That\u2019s not how we make people safer.What I've also said is that we can't sufficiently talk about the violence that's happening in our communities until we sufficiently talk about the violence that has happened to our communities. I mean benign neglect. I mean removing resources. I mean there's the shuttering of 50-plus schools. I think [about] the criminalization of being Black. We've seen that in Chicago for far too long. So we got to be able to deal with those issues.I\u2019ve talked to specifically young Black men in this city who have wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement. And that is something that they want to do, because they feel like they can give back to their community that way. But these guys, because either they\u2019re on a gang database or because they\u2019ve had a marijuana charge \u2014 which is legal now \u2014 at some point in their lives, have been told that they can\u2019t serve their community through that way. That\u2019s problematic. So I talked about that, in my plan too, removing some of those barriers that have made the police department more racist and more monolithic in a way that has not been helpful to our communities. So that for sure was a big deal to me.\u00a0But I also talk about CPD currently using this co-responder model now, where it\u2019s a pilot, but they\u2019re sending a mental health professional and a cop out when someone has a mental health call. To me, that\u2019s half baked, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right thing to do. Because if you come to the scene where I am, and I\u2019m having a mental health episode, I mean, I\u2019m not gonna see the guy with the clipboard. I\u2019ma see the dude with the gun and the badge.When I think about Quintonio LeGrier who was killed the day after Christmas in 2015. The young man called CPD on himself. He made a number of calls saying he was not feeling right. He was having a mental health episode. And he wanted help. And they sent two officers, with their weapons drawn, to go help a man who said that he was having an issue and [they] ended up killing him. They shot through the building next door and killed Bettie Jones, his next door neighbor, who was on her couch watching TV. There's no way you can make me think that a co-responder model stops that, but you know what stops that? If someone without a gun shows up. And so when I talk about repositioning the budget, I haven\u2019t gotten to really deep specifics, because as I said earlier, CPD lies about what their budget looks like. You got to get under the hood there, once you\u2019re in office, to see where those things kind of line up. But I truly believe that there has to be money there for us to, once again, [have] mental health professionals, social workers, civilianization. And I talk a lot about civilianization of the police force. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t think that you need a person with a gun and a badge to do everything, and we got young people in Chicago who don\u2019t want to be a cop but want to be in the law enforcement public-safety space. Why are there not jobs within the department for them?So it\u2019s not enough just to change policing in Chicago, we got to change Chicago, and that has to start with having leadership in city hall that is able to make the tough decisions on what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not increasing CPD\u2019s budget while clearance rates are still going down. It\u2019s not more money in the spaces that have been problematic given CPD\u2019s relationship with the community.\u00a0I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s pro-cop at all. Everything I\u2019ve tried to convey is really pro-Chicago. I\u2019ve said it and I\u2019ll say it again: Communities in Chicago know what they need to be safe. We need to listen to people. That\u2019s not currently happening. And I\u2019ve made that a pillar of the work that I want to do as mayor.CPD gets a lot of the city budget. With some of the ideas that you have in mind, as you just talked about with safety, how do you fund things like that? Where does the funding come from?When you talk about the civilianization of the police force, I think there are certain things that aren\u2019t going to be housed within the CPD budget. So I think you move some of those numbers around. I think there's ways to move some of what\u2019s already in CPD\u2019s budget. Once again, CPD has not been very forthcoming with where they're putting all their dollars. But I will be willing to bet, like, blind items for militarization and equipment, like, they have to go. I'm sure it's there. That's gotta go. So we can take that and put a social worker or mental health professional on the rolls. Let's do that.\u00a0I think some of that the budgetary stuff is a split between CPD and obviously the Chicago Department of Public Health, as well. The money's there.What also is true is that we've missed out on a lot of state and federal dollars, because we have not wanted to have a mental health infrastructure in this city. There are cities around the country \u2014 Austin, Texas, Philadelphia \u2014 who are getting big money from the federal government, because they have a plan. And we don't, so we're missing out on that, and that will changeHow do you feel about the SAFE-T Act? Is it something that you support?I helped write it. worked very hard to get it across the finish line. I've worked very hard over the last few months to defend it in public, especially from lies and outright attacks on just the face of it. And I'll tell you this, I know that it\u2019s monumental. And other folks around this country are watching to see what happens with it. And I'll continue to fight for it in Springfield and anywhere else that I can. We took, I think, courageous steps to dismantle a system that treats you better if you are guilty and you have the means than it does if you are innocent and you don\u2019t have the means. So when you dismantle and you attack systems like that, they will attack you back, which is what we\u2019re seeing today with the implementation and the rollout of the SAFE-T Act. But I\u2019m confident that it will begin to take form and people will see that we become a safer society when we\u2019re not over-policing, when there\u2019s accountability, when there\u2019s transparency, and when there\u2019s some real ways to measure success.Is there a correlation between mental health and violence in Chicago? And if so, how are you thinking about this correlation as you draft ideas around policies regarding safety and mental health?I think there are huge correlations. Honestly, I'll tell you, I think that we had a mental health issue in the city before the pandemic but I think it's only getting worse in the last two, almost three years, which is crazy. We got to be real about the perpetual trauma that we have put our communities through, specifically our young people.I was talking to some young people at a school in my district, Doolittle on 35th Street. And these young people not only had two or three classmates who were deceased, been shot and killed over the last few years, but as one young man was telling me about all the shootings that he saw over the last year, and he\u2019s keeping it inside, and there\u2019s nobody that you can talk to. In the school, there\u2019s nobody he can talk to in the space that can help him work through that trauma. We are putting this PTSD on our young people who don\u2019t have a way to deal with it.In my mental health plan,I call for reopening 20 mental health facilities in the city and making a number of those 24-hour facilities so people can come in throughout the day. Also, putting together mobile units so that folks can seek help no matter where they are on the street. And I think that all that matters. We're going to make sure we do that. I\u2019ve talked about putting mental health professionals in all of our Chicago schools. I think that's extremely important.And one thing that we don't talk enough about is the lead pipe removal. We know that our young people are being poisoned. And the city has said, \u201cWell listen, if you got lead pipes, you gotta figure it out yourself.\u201d The truth of the matter is, this is a city problem. The reason that we have more lead service lines in this city than anywhere else in the country is because up until the 1980s, the Chicago Code mandated that you use lead for service lines. So the city has to step up and say, \u201cListen, we've done this wrong, we gotta fix this.\u201d You can't tell me that there's no correlation between the lead service lines here and the violence in the city, when it comes to some of the mental health issues that exist. I think it's clear, and we got to be able to work through it.Do you support Treatment Not Trauma? And if so, how does that fit in with the ideas and policies you have around mental health and safety?Yes, I do. And when I built my mental health plan, about three months ago, it\u2019s very similar to the work that Treatment [Not] Trauma has tried to put forward.What\u2019s different in yours compared to the original Treatment Not Trauma?My plan is a little bit more robust. I talk more about actual operations of the mental health facilities. But my plan was inspired by the Treatment [Not] Trauma work, for sure.Mayor Lori Lightfoot promised an elected school board. And we know how that turned out. Will you support an elected school board if elected mayor?I\u2019m trying to say this in a more humble way. When the mayor backflips on her promise to give the people of Chicago an elected school board, the same thing that every other school district in this state has,it was my leadership in Springfield that got it over the top,that took us there. And so not only do I support the elected school board, I'm super proud of the fact that I was able to help get that bill across the finish line. I'm super proud of the fact that the elected school board trailer bill that we ran a couple of months after that was the bill that I wrote, and that I carried, which also put a moratorium on school closings in Chicago until after the elected school board is fully set. Because we know what school closings have done in their community and it appeared that the mayor was looking to do more of them.My mother spent 35 years as a Chicago Public School teacher. My little sister is a Chicago Public School teacher on the South Side of Chicago. My older sister is a Chicago Public School principal in Austin right now on the West Side. This is super important to me. And we\u2019ve got to make sure we get this right.The next mayor gets to pick half of that board because the hybrid starts in 2024. But I think not only do we have to have a mayor who embraces the way that this board works but is willing to work with this board. One thing we've seen with this mayor is an unwillingness to work with folks who are stakeholders, whether it's the City Council or community groups, and that's a problem. The reason it\u2019s a real big problem coming into this next four years is because we have a 21-member school board coming. We got 66 members of the police district councils. I don't see this mayor working with any of those groups. And so the only appropriate way for the city to move forward is to have a mayor that's able to work with all of those entities in a respectful way. And I\u2019ve proven I can do that.When you think about who should make up this board, what type of people would you select for it, if elected mayor? Tell me a little bit about what goes through your mind in terms of picking people for the board.Folks who have been committed to our young people. People who, whether they're community LSC members, or whether they are folks who have done work in and around education, I think that's important. Folks who are parents of CPS students. Folks who have a vested interest in this district. People who have some experience in how do we grow enrollment. CPS has, I think, lost kids for the last 11 years. What do we do to make this a top-notch school system? How do we give our young people the resources they need? So people who are thinking like that, and who are not concerned with titles, but really want to work and get some results.For decades, the sitting mayor of Chicago has been at odds with the Chicago Teachers Union, and many of the rank-and-file teachers, staff, and even students who complain about the lack of resources and poor conditions within the school. We all have been inside of CPS schools, especially in Black neighborhoods, and there needs to be some improvement there. What do you think the disconnect is?You know, I can\u2019t tell you that I know. But I do know that the disconnect has made it extremely difficult for our young people to learn, to succeed, to grow. And we\u2019re setting them up for failure. And that\u2019s problematic.What I've said is that the teachers union contract is coming up June 30, 2024. What I've promised is that I won't wait until June 15 to negotiate the new contract. I'll do it on day one. And I will not do it from behind the podium, or by press release or by tweet. But I will negotiate in good faith. And I'll do it myself, if I have to, from my kitchen table. Because we need some stability in this conversation between city hall, CPS and the teachers union, and it hasn't existed. This is very personal to me.When I become the next mayor of Chicago, I will be the first mayor who\u2019s a CPS graduate since Harold Washington. That\u2019s a big deal to me. You asked earlier how my upbringing contextualizes my politics? This is who I am. And I\u2019m tired of CPS being a laughingstock. I\u2019m tired of us not providing what our young people need. A little girl in Austin or a little boy in Bronzeville is not just competing against a kid from Evanston or Oak Park, or a kid from Wisconsin or Indiana. They\u2019re competing against kids from across the world. This is a global economy that we\u2019ve entered into and we have not put our young people in this city in a position to capitalize off that. We have to.Do you have any policies as you're working on or drafting around CPS and how to improve it\u2014and particularly when we're talking about schools in Black and brown neighborhoods?I think I may probably be the only person in this race who presented an actual education plan in September. We stood in front of a shuttered school in East Garfield Park. They had been closed down by Mayor Emanuel and we stood with the community to present our plan. Dwayne Truss, who was a school board member who Mayor Lightfoot kicked out because he didn\u2019t do what she wanted him to do, stood with us to endorse our education plan and to talk about how important it was that we were able to fix CPS to get it going. I think one of the biggest pieces that is going to be helpful as we move things along is that we got to have the resources from Springfield to make it happen. I\u2019ve fought for more funding for schools in Springfield since I\u2019ve been there. And we\u2019ve been able to increase the budget every single year.On day one, we have to have a mayor who can get on I-55 and go on down to the Capitol and make things happen. No one in this race can have the impact that needs to happen in Springfield to bring resources back to our schools like I can.Who do you have to talk to in Springfield to do that?Well, the Speaker of the House, the President of the Senate, and the Governor. Those are the folks who are really in charge down there. And obviously, I've had a great relationship with all three of them. I work very well with all three of them. I've been able to get monumental legislation passed down there.Historically, we've watched big developments displace and erase Black communities in Chicago, for example, we saw it happening with the University of Illinois being built on the West Side and the surrounding Medical District. We've seen it with the building of the 290 Expressway on the West Side. How would you create policies to support Black residents who are being priced out by some of the new developments such as the Obama Presidential Center or the casino coming to Cabrini Green?I've been a huge proponent of making sure that we have community benefits agreements that we have put in law, things that protect communities. I formerly worked for the Chicago Cubs. And when I worked for that organization, I was blown away when I first realized that there is literally a city ordinance to protect the Lakeview community from the Cubs. It was called the Neighborhood Protection Ordinance. And it requires the ballclub to provide a certain amount of security and litter cleanup and charitable money to organizations in the area. There's a lot that can happen when a community stands up. But I think the officials have to be able to build those protections for communities and we haven't seen that.I\u2019ve stood with the folks who called for the community benefits agreement for Woodlawn and Washington Park, around the Obama Presidential Center. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next few years with the US Steel site down on the southeast side of Chicago, in a community that has been a sacrifice zone for industrial harm and environmental failure. And so we\u2019ve got to start thinking about how we protect those folks.We've got to make sure that we're protecting these communities. I've done it in my role as a state representative. I think, as mayor, I believe that we have to institutionalize the protection of these communities from these big developments as well. And so I've not been shy about pushing back on some of these larger developments. In fact, there's a development or a proposed development in my state rep district, called One Central, which is supposed to be built across the street from Soldier Field. And if you look at the news coverage on that, I've been the one person pushing back to make sure that community has a voice in what happens in that space. And so that's this, my trademark.I take that very seriously.How do you enforce something like that? Even with the CBA that's out there in Woodlawn around the Obama Library right now, people are still being priced out.So I think that the Department of Housing has to be more aggressive and make sure that we are not letting the market fluctuate away that we're pricing people out.\u00a0I live in Bronzeville. There\u2019s a house across the street from me that's just over $700,000, which to me is asinine. I can't believe that. But we're seeing that. And so when we talk about rent stability, when we talk about making sure that people are not being priced out, that people aren't spending more than 30% of their income on where they live, the city housing department, I think, has a lot that we can do. We\u2019ve got to be smarter about the way zoning works specifically in communities that are ripe for gentrification. We got to make sure that we're not displacing folks. There\u2019s some things I think you can do through the zoning code to make that effective as well.Many of your campaign donors are from big businesses and reside outside of Chicago. How would you describe some of the people and groups who have endorsed you? And how are you accountable to them? Have you had to make any promises to them?So I prided myself as a state representative, and now as a mayoral candidate, on being clear, transparent and accountable to the people who sent me to the seat. And that's been very clear by my voting record. That\u2019s been very clear by me pushing back against power and authority when it's not doing the right things for the communities that I serve. And I gotta tell you, in this mayoral campaign, we have had more grassroots single donors than anyone else in this race, including the mayor. So these are Chicagoans from all across the city who want to see change, who are begging for new leadership. And we're really excited about that.\u00a0We'll see some endorsements coming along I think as early as this week, actually, on certain elected officials who are going to be endorsing our campaign, and then other groups as they go through their process as well. But I think that my track record in the General Assembly, and the folks who have supported me in this space, I have been very clear, right. So I've always gotten the endorsement and the support of folks like the Sierra Club, and folks like the Illinois Environmental Council, as well as grassroots groups on the ground, like the Worker Center for Racial Justice. And in those types of groups I've been able to do work with to actually get stuff done.We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist and organizer language, and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to go back on those promises when they get into office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?That's a great question. And it's unfortunate you have to ask that. We have seen people co-opt movements and language and say certain things, and then just to get into office and do a completely different thing.\u00a0As I started off this conversation, when I say son of Chicago, from here, born here, raised here, will die here. This is home. And I'm not going anywhere. And so to me, it's important to be accountable, not just to the people that I represent, but these are my friends, these are my neighbors. These are people who are part of my village in my community. And I can't say one thing today, and then go into something else, and then come back and say, welcome me back with open arms. It's just not how I operate.\u00a0And so I'll be very open and amenable to coming back and checking in with the people. Am I doing what I said I would do? Am I keeping the promises that I've made when I asked you for this job? This is a job interview. And it's an aggressive one. But for me, it's very important that people can clearly know who I am."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ald. Roderick Sawyer",
  "text": "Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward) is no stranger to Chicago politics. He\u2019s served in the City Council since 2011, when he defeated Freddrenna Lyle, who was appointed by then-mayor Richard M. Daley in 1998.\u00a0Sawyer was born and raised \u2014 and still resides \u2014 in Park Manor, one of the neighborhoods he represents in City Council, just like his father did. Like Daley, Sawyer is the son of a former Chicago mayor.\u00a0Following the death of Harold Washington, Sawyer\u2019s father, Ald. Eugene Sawyer, was tapped by a bloc of white aldermen to be mayor over Washington ally Timothy Evans. He served for two years until his defeat by Daley in the 1989 mayoral election. Daley maintained power for nearly three decades, longer than any other Chicago mayor. Sawyer explained that he follows in his father\u2019s footsteps not for family legacy, but as a public servant.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it,\u201d he said.\u00a0As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, Sawyer invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 5 to Oooh Wee It Is, a Black-owned restaurant in Chatham known for its Southern comfort food.\u00a0Currently, Sawyer serves as chairman of the City Council\u2019s Health and Human Relations Committee. In addition, he was chair of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus and the co-chair of the Progressive Reform Caucus.\u00a0He said that his record in City Council and the fact that he has garnered the support and trust of his colleagues in the chamber prove that he\u2019s equipped to be Chicago\u2019s next mayor.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve had groundbreaking legislation introduced and passed in City Council, so I have a proven ability to get things done,\u201d Sawyer said.\u00a0During his tenure in City Council, he has championed issues such as the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that established an elected civilian board of Chicago residents to oversee the Chicago Police Department (CPD), the fight for a $15 minimum wage, the push for an elected representative school board and GoodKids MadCity\u2019s Peace Book Ordinance.\u00a0He\u2019s also voted in favor of unpopular measures, including Emanuel\u2019s 2011 budget, which passed unanimously and closed six of the city\u2019s 12 mental health facilities, and a 2017 move to acquire property in West Garfield Park for a cop academy, which passed 48 to 1.During our conversation, Sawyer discussed his plans to address violence, mental health, youth, housing, reparations for Black Chicagoans and more.\u00a0He is not calling to increase or decrease the CPD\u2019s budget. Instead, according to his public safety plan, he wants to recruit more police officers, fix the city\u2019s emergency response system, improve officer wellness, invest in comprehensive police training and more. In addition, he supports Treatment Not Trauma, wants to address the root causes of violence and calls for revitalizing neighborhoods that have seen decades-long disinvestment.As an alder, he voted in line with mayor Rahm Emanuel 100 percent of the time from April 2017 to November 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Read our full interview with Sawyer, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: How did growing up in Park Manor shape your politics? Ald. Roderick Sawyer: Growing up in Park Manor and still living here today is quite a testament to the neighborhood and the people there. When I was growing up, I saw it at its best. I've seen it struggling, and I've seen it in challenging times. It never eliminated my resolve to want to stay here and try to improve upon what's here.I'm very adamant about where I came from. I spend an inordinate amount of time in my neighborhood because I feel strongly about the people here. They formed me into who I am now. So as a lawyer, as a business person and as a resident, it is overwhelming the love I get from my Park Manor neighbors, my Chatham neighbors, because we've all come through that struggle. We were all little kids together, delinquents, playing in the alleys and riding our bikes throughout the area. So for me to stay here and choose to be here is not a testament to me, but it's a testament to the others around me. So that is extremely important.You are the son of Chicago's second Black mayor, Eugene Sawyer. Yes.When the City Council was selecting a successor after the passing of Harold Washington, there was concern that appointing your father to the role would mean a return to machine politics. Also, most of the support he received from the chamber came from white alderpersons who were obstructionists to then-mayor Harold Washington and his agenda. There were also some accusations from some in the community that accused your father of selling out to white politicians.\u00a0\u00a0Why are you entering the race? Is it to follow in your father's footsteps? What did you learn from your father about public service?Well, let's just make some corrections. First, my father was chosen because he was the best candidate for that position. It was a troubling time after our friend Harold Washington died.My father was both chairman of the Rules Committee and president pro tempore. So that meant he ran the Rules Committee, and when Harold stepped out, he took over the mantle. That was an enormous amount of responsibility given to my father. No one has ever held two committee chairs at the same time besides him. So I give that as a testament of trust from the mayor to my father. The mayor knew that the job was going to get done. Furthermore, when Harold died, my father passed every initiative that Harold sought to pass and was unable to because of his untimely death. Even things that were against his own personal interests.My father was a devotee of Harold Washington. So all that talk was nonsense about him being beholden to white interests. My father was a proud Black man from this neighborhood [Park Manor] and Greensboro, Alabama. A person that stood there protecting Martin Luther King\u2019s house while he was at Alabama State.\u00a0\u00a0So all that noise people made back then was very troubling. It was disheartening because my father\u2019s interests were for his residents, the city, Chicago and the 6th Ward.\u00a0To answer your ultimate question, though, my father taught me a lot about how important it is to be a good steward of your community and how important public service is. So in that regard, yes, I am following my father\u2019s footsteps, not as mayor but as a public servant here in an area where I was born and raised, and because of that and what I saw from him, how people held him in high esteem because he helped those that were in this neighborhood. So I wanted to continue in that service. I\u2019m not running for mayor because of him. I\u2019m running for mayor because there\u2019s a problem, and I can help resolve it.I read that you feel that crime is our city's most pressing issue. Yet, if elected, you said you would first fire CPD Police Supt. David Brown. Is that still the case? Why or why not?I think our biggest problem is crime anxiety. That means no matter where you live in the city. If you go outside, you feel there\u2019s a chance that something might happen to you. That\u2019s the anxiety, and that has a financial cost.\u00a0Those that are of means don\u2019t go out because they feel that anxiety. That means they don\u2019t spend money at restaurants, bars and theaters and gyms, breweries and health clubs and all the things that we would expect them to spend money [on].When I saw David Brown down in Dallas, I was encouraged. I thought he would be a good superintendent because he supported his police officers down in Dallas. I saw that he was hard on crime and a tough guy. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not getting that same guy here right now. This is not the same David Brown.If elected, I would use that opportunity to use the platform that I worked on for seven years, the Empowering Communities for Public Safety, or ECPS [ordinance].I'm proud to say I was the lead sponsor of the ECPS ordinance, that I helped bring it to fruition. So we'll be electing community-based members to reestablish the trust between the community and the police and when we do that, people will feel more comfortable about talking to the police. That means they'll give police more information, which means we can solve more crimes, so that's how that works. It's a ripple effect.So I am a big proponent of that. I will also use that same platform to choose a superintendent that has the respect of the police department, of the rank and file, that has been through the system, that understands what we need in order to have officers laser focus on their job, which is to apprehend bad guys and bound them over for trial.Do you believe in increasing or decreasing CPD's budget? How do you feel the police budget should be allocated? We should have the resources necessary to respond to service calls. The City of Chicago is in a service business. That's especially true for the police. Police are a service. They're public servants; they serve you and serve everyone here.So if we don't have enough officers to respond to calls and it takes more than an hour to respond to calls, that's a problem. That's increasing that same anxiety I talked about. So now I've got robbed, I call the police, and no one shows up. That feels like no one's protecting me. That's that continued anxiety. So it won't make me feel better if no one shows up.\u00a0\u00a0So here\u2019s what we're talking about doing for nonviolent calls, let's say, unfortunately, you got robbed, but you're okay. You don\u2019t get harmed. They took your wallet, purse or car. You can call 9-1-1, and we can send somebody over to get a report from you, a uniformed officer. It can be a retired officer that knows how to take the report and get descriptions from you and pass on that information to those on the street that can hopefully apprehend that suspect or that offender and get them bound over for trial.How will you be investing in safety? Based on what you said, does that mean that you would hire more police officers?I would hire police officers where appropriate. I would make sure that we get past the level of retirements and defections. People are leaving. And ensure that it's not an either-or approach. I believe in getting the officers staffed to the appropriate level. Maybe it's retired officers or civilians that we need to hire to get those officers that we need to get on the street.\u00a0We may just need to reallocate some positions. But that doesn't mean we should not invest in mental health services, job opportunities, employment training, drug and substance abuse, or addiction. No, it's a both-and approach. We need to invest in all of those things.Are there other ways outside of police that you would invest in safety? Again, invest in mental health services treatment response that, maybe, someone can de-escalate a situation instead of arresting somebody. We can provide drug addiction services to those that are dependent. We need to invest in both of those things. It's not a do this and don't do that. You do both.In 2020, you proposed removing CPD from CPS in City Council. Has your opinion on that changed? Why or why not?Well, let me say this. My goal was not to remove police officers from schools. I wanted to spark a conversation on what police officers do in certain schools and how it sometimes has a negative effect on its students. I\u2019m glad it worked out the way it did because schools now make a choice. They can choose whether they want officers in their school or don\u2019t want officers, and it\u2019s a school LSC [Local School Council] choice. I\u2019m really happy with the way it came out.\u00a0People just misconstrued my goal. My goal was to spark a discussion, which it did. Sometimes you have to do bold things, and that\u2019s why you need a leader that will not be afraid to make a bold decision. I didn\u2019t make a rash decision; I made a bold decision.\u00a0We ended up saving some money. We saved several million dollars for those schools that chose not to have officers in their school and those that kept officers in schools that were happy with their officers. It empowered LSCs and others to make decisions on the future of their schools, which I'm happy that I did.Many of your colleagues voted in favor of Mayor Lightfoot's proposal to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth despite critics saying it would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth. You were one of the Black alders that voted against it. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? How would you fund these plans?We were thinking about how to keep them away, as opposed to how we engage with them and have them in a safe space where they can enjoy themselves, and when it's time to go home, they'll go home. They're tired, and they had a good time. We provided something good for them, and the organizers made a little money. That's how I made money as a kid. I threw parties. I was a DJ, threw parties, and was involved in that.\u00a0So I don't see that in youth right now. That's why they're so frustrated they don't have anywhere to let off that steam. When you're young, you have a lot of pent-up energy that you need to release, so that's dancing and acting silly for a minute. We needed to provide that for them. So they get frustrated, and they're going to act out, and that's what happened and that's a failure on our part.As an alderperson, you voted to shut down half of the city's mental health clinics during then-mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s administration. Yet, on your campaign website, you said you support Treatment Not Trauma. If you support Treatment Not Trauma, why did you vote to close those mental health clinics?When I was elected, I came in as chairman of the health and human relations committee, and the first thing I did was visit the remaining mental health centers. They were empty.\u00a0\u00a0There were hardly any patients at any level. I visited all of them. They said no alder ever visited them. I\u2019ve visited all of them. The first thing I did was to look at all of them and see what the resources were and if they were busy. Did we need to provide more resources?Back when I made that vote about the mental health centers, I did an article a couple of years later, and I said if I could take one vote back, the only vote I would take back was the closing of the mental health service [clinics]. We should have dived into that further.I don\u2019t think they shouldn\u2019t have been closed. We should have dived into it a bit further to find out why the administration wanted them closed. We did not do that; it was a cost-cutting money-saving measure. My eyes were opened when I visited them and realized that we were not using them. We were not advertising for them, and we\u2019re not promoting them. It wasn\u2019t known that they existed and that people could go there for free.\u00a0I realized they weren\u2019t accepting children. Because of our advocacy, they\u2019re caring for children now. They\u2019re expanding their hours, and they\u2019re starting to put promotions on. So I played a role in ensuring the administration became aware of a problem related to our mental health service.As you know, voters in your ward overwhelmingly supported the Treatment Not Trauma ballot referendum during the 2022 midterm. If elected, how would you fund the specific plans under the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance?We have funding available for Treatment Not Trauma. The Department of Health has a robust budget. We can fund Treatment Not Trauma, with no problems. Because that money is earmarked for certain things, we can have that money available for things like mental health services. We can use the money that's available now.\u00a0It's not as much a funding issue. It's an intentionality issue. Do people want this to happen? I don't see why you would not want it. You can save someone's life by providing them with mental health services instead of bringing in a police officer.\u00a0A police officer is trained to do a certain thing. Police officers are trained to apprehend and arrest. That's their job. It is needed in certain instances: when someone's robbing you, you want the police. When someone's having a mental health breakdown, you don't want the police. You want a mental health expert. You want somebody that can say, \u201ccalm down,\u201d or direct you to proper services. You need that kind of calming, de-escalating voice that could assist you.The COVID-19 pandemic has already highlighted existing disparities in schools with funding and resources, especially for Black and brown students. What policies will you enact in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school.We're about to have an elected representative school board that will be autonomous and work independently. In the interim, I will ensure that the schools have all the necessary resources to make them successful. I'm a big proponent of neighborhood schools.\u00a0\u00a0I want to ensure that we're getting all the resources possible to the most students because that's what's important. The future of our city is our children. I want to ensure that whatever we do, as relates to Chicago Public Schools, is in the right vein, without doing something crazy. I've worked with CTU [Chicago Teachers Union] in the past, and I'll continue to work with CTU going into the future. I'm just not beholden to CTU.\u00a0 I'm not going to be dictated to by anyone.How will you fund plans to invest in neighborhood schools?I've been around a long time, and I've been an LSC Chairman for 12 years as well. I've always been of the opinion that we run a lean, mean ship, as relates to your school finances. Money spent on certain ridiculous things sometimes has to be looked at and has to be eliminated. So you want to make sure that the schools can operate independently, within the confines of their budget based on student formula. That needs to be changed, but that's part of it. I think that's part of a longer discussion that has to be done with the state. I am going to dive into those types of things. Because when I talk about resetting Chicago, these are the types of things that we need to be resetting.Who will you appoint to this hybrid board?I would like a mix of educators, community people and those interested in our children's future. I don't think I have a tried-and-true set measure of who I want to appoint as far as people. Still, you want people in the financial industry so they understand how to operate budgets and adhere to them. You want educators, so we have a proper plan for all students, not just the high-performing ones.\u00a0You also want people that can engage parents and other committee members to get involved in what's happening in the schools. Schools should be open all day and evening, with resources and programs for students, and if necessary, parents. Sometimes parents need some additional training or education. So you want all that to happen, and that school should be that center of that neighborhood with all those resources in one place.You mentioned that you\u2019ve worked with the Chicago Teachers Union. Is there a specific plan or proposal that you have to fund schools? Because I was looking at your website, it wasn't clear what those policies would look like. Funding comes from a variety of sources: some from property taxes, some from our state and federal government, some from the city of Chicago. We want to make sure that we look at all those funding sources and see how they\u2019re operating.We keep increasing school funding, even though the number of enrollments keeps going down, something's not making sense. Once I can get there, take a look at it, and dive into it, we'll see what the problem is. Is it heavy on the front end? Does CPS hold too much real estate that's not performing? Is it budgetary issues? Do we have too many assistant directors and assistant commissioners in the front office and need more people on the frontline teaching our children?I know that many schools have eliminated the APs [assistant principals]. But, for example, that should not happen. We removed assistants in kindergarten and first grade, where now you have a teacher alone with 35 five-year-olds. Not a sustaining method, and it won\u2019t improve education.\u00a0\u00a0So I would like to look into these things and ensure that we\u2019re doing what\u2019s right by our students, not necessarily by the union [CTU] or front office personnel. We have to focus on what\u2019s important, and it\u2019s those children.Our readers are curious about taxes. So would what you\u2019re proposing to do require raising property taxes?No, that's a last resort. I will say that many candidates use this as a selling point about saying \"no taxes\" or \"never tax.\" You should have a responsible tax policy.\u00a0 A responsible tax policy, for example, as it relates to real estate taxes, is small, incremental steps in improving taxes.\u00a0If our CPI [consumer price index] goes up, we should have a small raise in property taxes to reflect the increased cost of goods and services. So if that happens, we need to make that incremental change instead of what we've been doing now, saying everything's fine. \u201cNo, we don't need to raise taxes ever, ever, ever until after an election to, \u201coh, we got to raise taxes.\u201d That's irresponsible, and it's wrong. We should be looking at more responsible tax policies, something that people won't even notice a one to two percent increase in their taxes every so often.If the CPI goes down, then we can look at rebates and maybe refunds for those that pay taxes. But again, only if the financial picture looks like it's warranted, not just because people like to hear it and we don't do it. That's what got us into the problem in the first place about not paying our pension obligations and not raising taxes to do necessary things, as opposed to doing popular things.Chicago is a city full of vibrant neighborhoods. But it\u2019s becoming difficult for many people to remain in the city. There are new developments that are coming in the center of neighborhoods. I\u2019m speaking specifically about Bally's casino project. You voted in favor of that. So what policies will you enact to support homeowners and renters from displacement and or people experiencing homelessness?I did vote in favor of that. One, we do have a very robust budget right now for homelessness. The problem is we only spent about 5 percent of the money. We have a lot of money sitting there just waiting to spend on homeless initiatives. We're sometimes looking in the wrong direction. I don't want to spend money that will benefit developers more than it benefits the homeless. That's where I really have a problem, and I stand by that.\u00a0\u00a0So when people talk about things like Bring Chicago Home, I love what the intention is. But when you peel back the onion, and I peeled back the onion, developers would tend to benefit more than the homeless people will. We can help the homeless right now. We can almost eradicate homelessness except for a couple of issues.\u00a0We have money to house the people that we count. Most of them don't want to go into the types of structures we've been used to building. They'd rather be in that community that they're in off of Roosevelt Road on the expressway because at least they know that they're going to care for each other. That\u2019s where their community is.\u00a0We may not understand it. I've talked to enough homeless people to know that sometimes the help they're looking for is not the help that we're used to providing. If we're saying, I can take care of you and put you in a shelter. They don't want to be in a shelter. They know they've been robbed and raped and assaulted in shelters, they have a bad experience in the shelters, they don't want to go back.\u00a0Let's talk about giving them resources, treatment, opportunity, employment, and training, to get them to a space where we can get them a starter home or starter apartment, and then they can continue to get the treatment or work experience to earn money. That's what I look at. I look at more organic solutions, not just saying, hey, let's plop them in a flophouse down in a mission and we've done our part. That's short-sighted.I remember being at a meeting where you were with other Black elected officials. At the meeting, you explained how challenging it is for you and your colleagues to represent parts of Englewood because it has so many vacant and abandoned properties. What are your plans to revitalize neighborhoods, like Englewood, with many vacant areas/properties? What we don't do is give our Black developers and all minority developers, for that sake, resources and opportunities to develop in their backyards and their homes. Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Garfield Park, you name it. We have abandoned areas all over the city, and could benefit from developers coming. No downtown developer is going to come out here, and they'll tell you the same thing. I\u2019ve had a developer tell me if I build in Fulton Market, I can get this much per unit rent or sell it. If I build out here, I can\u2019t get this much unless you can find the difference. What's my incentive in coming out here to build?\u00a0We got African American builders that will build. We\u2019d have to relax some of the union issues, and other issues to give them a leg up to do quality developments here on the South and the West sides.\u00a0We need to start doing that and getting these developers engaged so they can no longer be small developers. They'll have a goal and a mindset to deal more in a neighborhood that helped raise them as opposed to just going downtown.They can build a block at a time. Maybe two or three developers, then build the entire block then we can do another block. Because I literally have blocks of vacant land in this little area of Englewood that I have. I know my colleagues have even larger swaths of land that could be developed and sold or rented, or whatever the case may be, to homeowners who are working, but they need help to make ends meet.\u00a0We can get them that quality, affordable housing out here. Close to the L line. If they're working downtown, they can pop on the L in 15 minutes, then be at work or school or whatever the case may be. We need to start looking at that instead of just being downtown centric. However, I know how important downtown is to our bottom line. But it's not the end all be all.Black Chicagoans have been leaving for the city in droves since the 2000s for many reasons. But I wonder what specific policies or plans your administration will enact so we don't lose more Black Chicagoans. We must have a marketing plan for bringing people back home to Chicago. It should literally be: bring Chicagoans back home. We need to engage with marketing people, preferably Black people. Chicago is a great city. Chicago has plenty of amenities. It's a world-class city. We can trim off the problematic things and get those vibrant. There's no other city better.\u00a0We need to promote that and make an investment. Sometimes you have to invest to get something back. I don't like spending money just to be spending money; giveaways and gimmicks are not my thing. So we're going to make true investments in Chicago, invest in the future of Chicago, ensuring that people know how great Chicago is and the amenities we can provide them.\u00a0Englewood can be restored to great glory. It's intentionality who's at the head, spearheading that, and has that sense of vision to say that we can do this here in Englewood, we can do this in East Garfield Park, we can do this in Lawndale. We can do this and all these other challenging areas, like Pilsen and Little Village. We can do it in areas that have been marginalized in the past. It takes the leader at the top to say, this is what we're going to do, and this is how we will do it.How do we fund that?There are a variety of ways to fund it. There's bond funding. There are a lot of different funding mechanisms, particularly in blighted areas. We will work with our partners in the state and federal government. We might have to issue bonds. We had to issue some debt in order to get some of the things done and kick-start it.\u00a0 There's a variety of ways. We're not broke. We sometimes struggle because we make bad decisions, and we need to make fewer bad decisions and more financially conservative decisions that make sense. You make investments; you don't spend money.Speaking of investment in Black Chicago and keeping Black people here, should reparations be at the forefront in 2023?I feel it should be. I've been trying to push reparations for years. After learning more about it, I introduced it to the City Council.The mayor told me: \u201cI wasn't doing \"s---\" about reparations; that's nothing but a Willie Wilson gimmick.\u201dMr. Wilson was helping us financially with getting the word out about reparations. He was learning about reparations as well. We were doing what we could to show how important the repair part was. I\u2019ve talked to epidemiologists and epigeneticists.The problems that we have currently go back to us being enslaved and going through the Jim Crow Era, and the redlining and all the things that we\u2019ve gone through over decades and decades, and it makes us react a certain way.\u00a0\u00a0We need to dive into that and find out what that problem is, and once we do that, everybody benefits. So I\u2019m not as interested in something other than the 40 acres and mule money type of thing. That\u2019s more of a federal conversation. Mine is more the health disparities, educational disparities and things like that that are important, and there\u2019s a reason for that. There\u2019s a reason for that, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve dove into it enough. There\u2019s a word for that. The mayor [Lightfoot] would not use the word reparations. If you ask her, she would not say reparations.Your initial plan was just getting a commission?We've done enough studying. It wasn\u2019t about a study. I wanted a reparations commission equal to Streets and Sanitation and the Department of Transportation. I wanted an executive-level commission on reparations to discuss the repair we need as descendants of enslaved Africans.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't get support. I couldn't even get Black support. It was difficult because people didn't understand it. I remember having a few of my colleagues go to a couple of meetings because I had to have off-site meetings, and I could not get a meeting in council.\u00a0Under my administration, reparations will be at the forefront. We got to talk about it. We have to do it. We have to understand, and I want more people to understand. I want white people and everybody to understand it because it's vital for all.I noticed that you don't necessarily have large-scale endorsements like your other opponents in the race.No, because I'm not beholden to anybody in this race.So who are you accountable to?I'm accountable to the citizens of the city of Chicago. These are the people I hold in high esteem, and I feel accountable to everyday residents, people that go to work every day, unemployed people, people that are struggling and people that do well. I represent true Chicagoans, those that want good schools, vibrant business districts, safe streets and to enjoy their neighborhoods and go home safely. These are the people that I represent. These are the people that support me.I had to look at some previous articles and interviews to prepare my questions today because your website doesn\u2019t have a policy platform written out in detail at the time of this interview. How can Chicago voters be confident in you as a policymaker and hold you accountable for your campaign promises?I've been as prodigious on policy matters as any alderman in the City Council. From anti-privatization to police reform to business initiatives, I've shown my chops in bringing things forward and getting things done.\u00a0The elected representative school board, we were there \u2014 labor peace at the airports and childcare. These are things that I was always at the forefront of, leading, not just voting for it \u2014 leading, advocating getting votes, whipping votes for it, and passing it.\u00a0My history speaks for itself. I have the background. I have proven that I can work within different committees. I work with DSA [Democratic Socialists of America] members. I work with the conservative caucus. I work with the veteran's caucus, I work with everyone. I ensure that my ordinances get support from all levels of representation on the council. That's what you'll get from Mayor Sawyer."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Brandon Johnson",
  "text": "Last fall, Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson entered the 2023 Chicago mayoral race with a truly progressive platform and campaign centering coalition-building across racial lines.Since then, Johnson has gotten endorsements from politicians such as U.S. Reps. Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-4); the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Healthcare, Cook County College Teachers Union, and the Illinois Federation of Teachers. He\u2019s got $1.8 million on hand.\u201cI\u2019m in a position to be the next mayor of Chicago because the movement is being heard, and I\u2019m a reflection of that movement,\u201d he said.\u00a0On Jan. 3 Johnson, who lives in Austin with his wife and children, invited The TRiiBE to principle barbers in North Lawndale. After getting a quick edge-up by his friend Bobby Price, he discussed his vision for Chicago.Throughout our interview, Johnson repeatedly emphasized the need to invest in people first and foremost. He advocates for sustainable community schools, employment opportunities, affordable housing, and funding robust summer youth programs and a gun violence and prevention office.He reiterated his commitment to redirecting funds from police and jails to public services, one he led as commissioner in 2020.\u201cYou prioritize based upon the values that you have,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI believe in our people. I love our people, and everything that I want for my children, I want that for every single child in the city of Chicago, and I want parents to be able to deliver that.\u201d\u00a0A former Chicago Public Schools teacher, Johnson started at Jenner Academy in Cabrini Green. As a CTU organizer, he was part of the 2012 strike and connected with community organizers who shared the union\u2019s progressive social vision. Many, like him, are now elected officials: State Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th), and Alds. Jeanette Taylor (20th), Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th).With Taylor, he joined parents and community members in a 34-day hunger strike in 2015 demanding the city reopen Washington Park\u2019s Walter H. Dyett High School. The hunger strikers saved the school. Revived as Dyett High School for the Arts, its first class graduated in 2020.\u00a0Johnson\u2019s district is anchored by Austin on the east side and suburban Bellwood on the west. He told The TRiiBE he wasn\u2019t initially trying to be a politician but felt compelled to because elected leaders \u201cwe were pushing wouldn\u2019t react, so we had to beat them.\u201d\u00a0Read our full interview with Johnson as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.The TRiiBE:\u00a0Growing up, what shaped your politics and outlook on life?As leaders and pastors, my parents helped shape my worldview.\u00a0The simplest way I can articulate this is that we are not our own, we have a responsibility to one another, and are only as strong as we are collectively. So the type of selflessness is the act of service recognizing that we are ultimately accountable to something bigger than ourselves. That's what shaped my view of the world. It's how I've led as a husband, a father, teacher, organizer, and as county commissioner, and what my intentions will be as mayor of Chicago.You would be the first mayor living on the West Side. How has living and working in Austin shaped your views?Yeah, so not a native South sider. But the dynamic on the West Side of Chicago, particularly Austin, it\u2019s the largest Black city inside the city of Chicago. It's a beautiful place. It has a tremendous rich history. Many of our relatives and family members and Black folks in general\u2014during that second migration\u2014set up shop on the West Side of Chicago.\u00a0It's also the place, of course, where Dr. King visited. We're in North Lawndale. So this is where Dr. King wanted to ensure he was connected to people he described as the world's most realest people.\u00a0 That's what the West Side of Chicago is. It's the place where it doesn't get more authentic. The full expression of blackness is on the west side of Chicago, working people. You know, middle-class folks, political leaders. You have artists. So you have everyone from Dorothy Tucker to Robert Townsend.\u00a0\u00a0The West Side of Chicago has certainly been a place where Black political power and Black existence have found its richness in a variety of disciplines. And it is the place where again, everyday working people come just to be able to experience that which is like righteous, but that which is, to some extent, just chill.The dynamic on the West Side of Chicago, particularly Austin, it\u2019s the largest Black city inside the city of Chicago.

And it is the place where again, everyday working people come just to be able to experience that which is like righteous, but that which is, to some extent, just chill.Gun violence is a significant issue in Chicago. On your website, you cited it as a city's biggest problem and pledged to take preventative measures to address it. How will your administration invest in safety?Studies have indicated that youth employment reduces violence. It does. The most dramatic thing that we can do to reduce violence is to hire young people and give them opportunities that have been missing from our political space for too long. We just haven't done enough.We can\u2019t simply nibble around the edges. This is why I\u2019m calling for a very robust youth hiring program that will provide the type of opportunities and purpose that young people need.\u00a0 The second thing is the launch of an office of gun violence and violence prevention so that we are putting together all the tactical solutions that get guns off the street. The third thing is that Chicago is under enormous trauma. If we're not treating that trauma, and we're only doing things that further exacerbate it, then we're not being very honest about our desire to see transformation in the city of Chicago.  So that requires, again, someone who believes in public accommodations. And so reopening our health clinics, which many organizers, Black organizers, particularly around the city of Chicago, have been pushing for that.I'm going to respond to that. The Treatment Not Trauma ordinance is sponsored by the 33rd Ward alderperson [Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez].We have a lot of Black organizers around the city who've been pushing for that. I'm gonna respond to that positively. As you know, last spring, Mayor Lori Lightfoot extended the citywide curfew after the shooting of a 16-year-old in Millennium Park, despite critics saying it would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within CPS and outside CPS? What initiatives or policies need to be drafted?We know that schools can be hubs for the community as a whole.The second thing is this: we have these amazing parks that do not get supportedin a way that can be a place for young people. Let\u2019s just start there. My children attended Garfield Park over the summer.The summer program ends at one o'clock. Thank God for Memaw; that's my mother-in-law. Otherwise, it wouldn't work.So, the initiative, besides expanding community spaces within our public school system, but it\u2019s also our park districts.All those things are important. I\u2019m going to invest in those things. But it\u2019s also about ensuring young people experience purpose and know someone loves them and cares for them. As mayor of Chicago, especially as somebody who has taught in public schools, I know what the look of desperation looks like.\u00a0If young people are prepared and willing to go through programming, and they\u2019re willing to work, there\u2019s going to be a space for them. We\u2019re going to find the resources to fund it. So that it\u2019s not just a place for young people are kicking it. It\u2019s a place where they\u2019re contributing. Because the best thing that you could do for any human being is to help them find purpose. And as mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m gonna do that.You introduced a nonbinding resolution that the Cook County Board passed in the summer of 2020 that supported redirecting \u201cfunds from policing and incarceration to public services not administered by law enforcement that promote community health and safety equitably.\u201d Do you still support reallocating dollars away from police?The addiction that this city, and quite frankly this country has on jails and incarceration has proven to be problematic. Are we any safer? Are our communities walkable? So my 15-year-old son, who's a student in Kenwood, in his third week at school, one of the students leaves out for lunch and gets murdered, and we're spending $5 million a day [on policing].We're talking about a $3 billion budget. and the clearance rate for solving crimes is abysmal. Folks still don't have a trusted, strong connection between law enforcement and the community. We spend more money on jails and incarceration than we do on housing and violence prevention. Here\u2019s the impetus behind it. As mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m about doing what works.If we\u2019re saying that we have to get at the root causes of the ailment that has plagued communities that have been disinvested in for generations, then let\u2019s do that. The whole point of the 2020 resolution was to provoke us into doing what works, and to remove ourselves from these really bad habits that only exacerbate the conditions in which we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re trying to transform and change. Let's do what safe communities do. They fully fund their schools. Look at Oak Park, two fully funded school districtsin one town.They have libraries that stay open to nine o'clock at nightwith programs. They have parks that are fully supported. They love their children so much that they will provide opportunities for children to be able to experience childhood. Why is that any different for those of us who live in Chicago? It shouldn't be. It shouldn't be. And as mayor of Chicago, we\u2019re transforming that.We\u2019re going to stop relying upon these age-old systems that continue to harm and terrorize our communities. When we know that things that work require us to love our children, to love the people who are raising those children and to invest in them. So clearly, my position is still the same. I love our people enough to invest in them and will do that as mayor of Chicago.The main question that people will want to know and have a clear answer to is about CPD\u2019s budget. Is that something you would increase or decrease as mayor?The police budget is almost $3 billion, and our communities aren\u2019t safer.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know how we can continue to go down a path that has demonstrated that it doesn\u2019t work.It\u2019s about where our priorities should be. I can say emphatically, and based upon the record that my priorities are going to be in education, housing, mental health, jobs, transportation and our parks. That\u2019s where our priorities are gonna be. Look, we\u2019re going to have to examine every aspect of the city\u2019s budget, but this one, in particular, has demonstrated that the return that folks said we would get as a result of these investments that return hasn\u2019t manifested.There\u2019s no return on that so-called investment. I\u2019m not going to commit to anything budgetarily that has demonstrated that it has failed our people and failed our communities. So you know, as I\u2019ve committed to justice for Black lives, budget for Black lives, that doesn't change when I\u2019m the mayor of Chicago. We have to invest in the areas in which we know that work. Right now,the way this budget is situated, particularly around policing, hasn't worked.What initiatives and policies will you enact for neighborhood elementary and high schools so that Black and brown children won't have to be in their communities to go to school? Many have to leave because their schools don't have the resources they need to thrive.I will be the first mayor in recent history that actually believes in public education because not only am I a product of public schools, my children are the students in Chicago Public Schools. So when you talk about the dynamics within the community, my wife and I live in Austin, and we take two babies \u2014 eight and ten years old; they\u2019re in the third and fifth grades \u2014\u00a0 20 to 25 minutes northwest to Portage Park.\u00a0\u00a0Our 15-year-old [is] a freshman at Kenwood. So we take him 25 to 30 minutes south, primarily because we don't have a school in Austin that fully supports the arts. So we had to leave our community to have orchestra, sports and a nurse. These are not unattainable things.\u00a0The first thing that I'm going to push for is something called Sustainable Community Schools. It's a policy we've been promoting through the work of community-based organizations and labor, where labor and the community are coming together to provide the type of enriched or fully supported school communities that are needed.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing, of course, is making sure that we have a plan to help transform our high schools because, as you mentioned, it's important to note that the decline we are experiencing is by design.This is not something that occurred by happenstance. You've had administration after administration in this city that has disrupted public housing. They've closed public schools and eliminated public employee work, which Black folks, in particular, benefited from. So it shouldn't be a surprise that the number of students and families we lost during the school closings is almost equivalent to the number needed to keep a Black ward.  Is simply investing in schools enough to address the declining enrollment?\u00a0 What are other long-term things needed? You mentioned sustainable community schools, and the second point is a plan to transform high schools. What other things would you propose outside of that?The best thing you can do for a child's education and academic success is to ensure their parents have W-2s. However, we do have to have a commitment to public education and funding.If children are coming to school every single day unhoused, hungry and sick, they\u2019re not thinking about drawing conclusions or the author\u2019s approach or balancing equations or the periodic table.\u00a0As mayor of Chicago, my top priority is to make sure that people will have access to economic security without a baseline of economic security. Everything else becomes not just a stress on that particular family. It becomes a stress on the community and it becomes a stress on the government. To relieve that stress, we have to provide you with opportunities. The big thing that we have to do is create opportunities for folks that have to go to work every day, have decent-paying jobs, access to insurance and they have dignity and respect in their workspaces.So beginning in 2025, Chicago will have an elected school board. So if elected, how will you work to support this effort? And who would you appoint to the hybrid board?I'm very excited that in the midst of a country where democracy is being curtailed, we're actually expanding that in Chicago. The mayor of Chicago [Mayor Lori Lightfoot] promised that, and then she flaked and went against one of her campaign promises.So I want to lean into that a bit because it's actually incredibly disrespectful because of the work, time, effort and sacrifices people put forward to have that type of democratic accountability.We've lost schools, and we've lost Black educators, and the curriculum has been narrowed around mayoral control. Mayoral control has been a failure for Black people in particular, but for the system as a whole. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do in 2024 because we don\u2019t get the fully elected board until 2026.I\u2019m going to go to the community, and I\u2019m going to the City Council to make sure that the representation that we have for those 11 seats reflects the values that actually promoted the elected representative school board in the first place. It has to be people who actually believe in public accommodations.\u00a0They have to believe that a budget has to speak to the needs of people. They have to believe that the teaching force and the entire education force, whether you\u2019re a teacher\u2019s assistant, a teacher, a nurse or custodial, that the workers should be supported. Those are the baseline for anyone who is going to be on the board going to go through a vetting process with the community and City Council, and they have to stand up for those three principles. Anything less than that would be will be irresponsible. It\u2019ll just simply be more of the same.What are your plans to reopen closed mental health clinics?I'm working with mental health advocates. Part of my criteria has to be where violence and poverty per capita is at its worst. Let's look at neighborhoods like Englewood, North Lawndale, Garfield Park or Roseland, where violence and poverty per capita has been described in certain parts of the city as [comparable to] developing nations. This is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, and we have pockets of the city that reflect and mirror developing nations.The advocates who understand and know this work will help guide how we reopen and how we classify these spaces. I\u2019m incredibly impressed with the young Black organizers who have been leading on this. They will have not just have a seat at the table on the fifth floor. They will get to help set it. All I\u2019m saying is that [at] the very least, the baseline has to be violence and poverty per capita. Where those two dynamics intersect, we should start to build up from there. I\u2019m gonna lean on the experts and the organizers to help guide that in my administration.What policies or initiatives will you enact to support renters and homeowners from displacement? And also, what will you do to support people experiencing homelessness?No one should be too poor to live in the city of Chicago. No one. So part of what we have to do is make sure that the real estate transfer tax gets a real look and figure out how to appropriate dollars towards those unhoused families.The second thing that we have to do is that we have to have a real commitment to public housing.So that's why I'm supportive of not building anything on land that was once the home for public housing.The third thing is the type of investments that we need to make in our communities, particularly around revenue. That\u2019s something that, as mayor of Chicago, I\u2019m going to be very much focused on, progressive revenue, to be able to make the type of investments to address the economic insecurity that is playing out, particularly in housing.You mentioned the Real Estate Transfer Tax. Does that mean you support Bring Chicago Home?Yes, I do support it.You specifically mentioned homeowners, but a lot of our readers are renters. What type of support do you see for helping people be able to afford rent?It's two-fold. If we're not providing real economic opportunities for folks [to] actually get jobs and give well-paying jobs whether that rent is $675 or $1,200 dollars month, if you don't have real economic opportunity to have a good decent paying job, we're going to continue to lose talent, especially within our community.So that\u2019s everything from creating opportunities in the public space that I will have jurisdiction over challenging our corporations to incentivize them actually to hire our people. So one of the things that we are pushing is that for our larger corporations, there are ways in which we can provide tax incentives and raise revenue and tax incentives. Hiring our people in these big corporations could alleviate some of the tax burdens that some of these corporations want some relief from. At the same time, if you\u2019re not prioritizing our folks, then you can contribute more skin in the game since you ain\u2019t hiring us.So a lot of these initiatives, quite frankly, we're going to need intervention from Springfield, of which many of those things that have been proposed as an organizer, very supportive of them. It's going to require those relationships, especially around how we look at rent, and how we make sure that rent is not outpacing the income that many of our young Black professionals particularly are stuck in. I very much understand that it does require some intervention from the state to make sure that that relief is available.You've received major financial endorsements from several national and local labor unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Chicago Teachers Union, SEIU Healthcare and United Working Families. In what ways are you accountable to those labor unions that are endorsing you? And what is your relationship with those groups?I'm accountable to all the people who I will represent. I'm accountable to working people. I'm accountable to those who are struggling to exist in the middle class. I'm accountable to those families that are experiencing poverty. I'm accountable to those families who have experienced some economic security but still don't feel safe.My relationship to the labor movement is deeply tethered to a long history in this country where civil rights and labor rights have worked hand in hand to ultimately bring economic justice to Black folksSo that's my relationship. As a social studies teacher, I'm aware of that. I'm conscious of that. I was raised by someone who was part of the labor movement. My father was a public employee who was a part of the AFSCME Labor Union. So there's a long history of Black workers tethered to the labor movement who were also fighting for civil rights in Chicago, and I'm a part of that history.We\u2019ve witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist organizer language, and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to go back on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?Accountability is important. Look, as I said, I'm one of 10 [children]. So I've learned how to be responsible for my younger siblings, but also accountable to my older siblings. The best way in which the movement can hold me accountable is to stay connected with the administration. You don't have to wait on my administration to call for a community gathering, or for a family sit-down.\u00a0\u00a0We're going to pass one of the most dramatic budgets by the third year of my administration, because of the structural challenges that previous administrations have ignored. I'm gonna need the family to help me do that. I am. I hope that the family will hang in there with me and also take a look at what I've done thus far.There\u2019s no other candidate that put together an entire budget around Black people. I don't know if anyone's done that in the entire country. I'm the only candidate in this race that specifically called for investing in the things that work and not in jails and incarceration. No one had to come in and pound on my door to do what I promised to do.\u00a0There will be forces out there trying to disrupt that and separate us from one another. Those forces have been trying to do that for how many years in this country, separating Black folks from our interests. I'm a social studies teacher, I'm clear on how that looks. I want to bring the family together. That's why I'm running to be the mayor of Chicago, let's bring the family together. When it gets tough, let's hang in there together and let's build it together. The administration that I'm going to lead as mayor of Chicago is all about building bridges; it's certainly ain't going to be raising them.There\u2019s no other candidate that put together an entire budget around Black people.I don't know if anyone's done that in the entire country. I'm the only candidate in this race that specifically called for investing in the things that work and not in jails and incarceration. No one had to come in and pound on my door to do what I promised to do."

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ald. Sophia King",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward) carries her roots with her each and every day. Her mother went from picking cotton in the Mississippi Delta to getting a scholarship to Northwestern University, earning a PhD over time while raising her family. Spending her childhood between Mississippi and Evanston deepened King\u2019s love for her culture.King has long been in community with other prominent Black Chicagoans. Barack Obama is a longtime friend and hoop-buddy of her husband (attorney and Chosen Few DJ Alan King), and the former president endorsed her 2017 aldermanic run. And before she got into politics, King helped establish the Ariel Community Academy, and founded Harriet\u2019s Daughters, a group named for Harriet Tubman that brings Black professional women together to increase employment and wealth in the community.\u201cI\u2019ve always been about uplifting our community,\u201d she told the The TRiiBE, noting that as an alder she championed efforts to rename streets after Black luminaries such as Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, the first non-indigenous Chicagoan, and journalists Ida B. Wells and Lerone Bennett Jr.\u00a0As part of our 2023 Black mayoral candidate interview series, King invited The TRiiBE on Jan. 10 to her Kenwood home, about a block away from Louis Farrakhan\u2019s million-dollar manse. King sat on a leather couch in her living room, which was also furnished with a writing desk and accented by esteemed Black literary works such as Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019s The 1619 Project and Zora Neale Hurston\u2019s Barracoon, an Indigenous painting, another depicting revolutionary Black men, and a sculpture made by her biological father.\u201cI\u2019m very Afrocentric. Proud of who I am. My mother is a sociologist. I have two fathers. My biological father, who\u2019s passed away, his focus was African American art,\u201d King said. \u201cI get a difference of opinion about who people think I am. They think they know me.\u201dCurrently, King serves as chair of the City Council\u2019s Progressive Reform Caucus, and a member of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus. Since her appointment \u2014 by Rahm Emanuel \u2014 to City Council in 2016, King has been a co-sponsor of multiple progressive initiatives, including the Anjanette Young Ordinance to ban no-knock police raids, the Community Commission of Public Safety and Accountability and the Bring Home Chicago ordinance, and she led the 2014 drive to raise Chicago\u2019s minimum wage to $15.During our interview, King said she doesn\u2019t believe in decreasing the Chicago police budget. She believes that good policing works, and in her public safety plan, that means redirecting resources to community policing, alternative response and violence intervention programs, as well as putting more cops in neighborhoods and \u201cembracing\u201d surveillance technology.Read our full interview with King, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)Why did you enter the mayoral race this year? And what power does being in the mayor's office give you that you don't already have as alderwoman?There are a number of reasons.There's just a lot of dissension coming from the mayor's office between that office and teachers, police, my colleagues \u2014 another one just left yesterday, I believe we\u2019re up to 16.It's not coincidental. There's just a lot of tension.I tried very early to make a connection, because I wanted to see an African American woman do well, as, that\u2019s me, part of me, right? But, yeah, the tension continues. I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that this is one of the most difficult periods in the country, in the world, with social unrest, with COVID. And so you have to acknowledge that and put it in that context, and I did.\u00a0But the issue, I think \u2014 and it took me a while \u2014 is that, given that instability and insecurity that everybody was feeling, it was a time when we should have come together as a city, and we didn\u2019t. And again, I think that\u2019s part of leadership.\u00a0And the other reason is because when I saw people stand up [to run for mayor], I didn\u2019t see somebody who could represent the entire city while doubling down in our communities.I represent [a ward that runs] from downtown to Hyde Park, and I have Bronzeville in the middle \u2014 we called it the Low End growing up \u2014 you know, it's very diverse. I got some of the poorest people. I have more CHA senior homes than probably any other ward in the city, but I also have part of downtown. I go up to Jackson Boulevard, Grant Park, Northerly Island, Soldier Field, Museum Campus, and I have Hyde Park, which is kind of the city\u2019s epicenter of diversity and equity. And then I have some of the most segregated parts and poorest parts with plans for transformation sites. I've got Ida B. Wells, I've got the Washington Park Corridor, I've got Lake Park, North Kenwood, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Douglas. I've got all of the CHA homes. I get to see everything.Most wards are more contiguous, homogenous, and [made up of] similar folks, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s different; I have all of these communities that are very distinct and unique in their own ways. But I also get to see those similarities.\u00a0I have two different police districts; one\u2019s downtown, one south. I get to see the disproportionate amount of resources going to, in real time, I get to see the disproportionate amount of clearance rates. But I also lead with equity. So, with our [aldermanic] menu money, Grand Boulevard gets most of that money because they\u2019re the most under-resourced area that I have.\u00a0I see the juxtaposition of A Tale of Two Cities, as people would say it. But I think that puts me in good stead to kind of understand the challenges that we face as well as what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not.And more specifically about the power aspect. What power would you get as mayor compared to the power that you already have as alderwoman?That's a great question. The difference is, as alderman, I spend all my time advocating for resources that the mayor\u2019s office controls on behalf of my constituents. I have no control over it. And not that I want to have control, but I certainly want to be able to get those resources for my community.\u00a0In this diverse ward, crime has touched places where people with power can weigh in, and they're paying attention. I've been able to see the differences and disparity there. But what I can't do is control how officers are deployed in a more equitable fashion. That comes from the mayor's office. If the garbage isn't picked up, if the snow isn\u2019t plowed, the mayor's office controls that. The power is too centralized now. We need to decentralize it so that the community can feel that.\u00a0There's no reason why me as an elected official shouldn't have better communication with the mayor. We share constituents. And so that challenge is a challenge for our city, because there's no way that she can singularly understand how each community is feeling. And that's why the City Council was made to be a strong council/weak mayor, so that you can balance that better. And so that's what I've found, that the challenges that I face for really helping my residents lay in the mayor's office. And so that's where I feel the differences.\u00a0A city councilman really has two jobs. One is to balance a budget every year and legislate. Now, that's probably 10% of what I actually do. Ninety percent of it is truly advocating for, on behalf of, my constituents for their needs, whether that be for housing, or whether it be, you know, for violence intervention programs, or police presence, or homeless insecurities, or all of those things.In October, you said we can deploy drones as first responders, and they can chase offenders if need be, and that we can also use other technology better, such as ShotSpotter. Also, your 10-point safety plan includes immediately increasing police presence in the community. To be honest, much of this sounds similar to efforts by previous administrations who have increased policing and surveillance.\u00a0Is there any evidence that supports that the items that you highlight in your 10-point safety plan will effectively reduce crime in Chicago?For our campaign, the power of \u201cand\u201d is really important. And so in the 10-point Plan, one of the biggest points of it is several hundred million dollars for violence intervention. I think that\u2019s part of it. If you really read it, it\u2019s a people\u2019s racial redress plan. So, you know, having $600 a week to incent our most vulnerable [residents] and those likely to be shot and get shot to come into the legal market and to use wraparound services to supplement that. And, you know, job training, I think that\u2019s the important piece of it.But I do actually think that good policing works. And that's why I said that we can uplift police and hold them accountable, that they're not mutually exclusive. I've seen the evidence of that in my own ward. And I've also seen the evidence of the false narrative that we don't need [police] in our community. So let me explain.It's our communities that have the lowest clearance rates, meaning the unsolved murders, the unsolved shootings, unsolved everything. It's also our communities that disproportionately have less police than everyone else.And I get it. It is not the only solution.How do you want to fund your 10-point plan?The state has billions from the federal government; the city does, so does the county, and everybody's doing their own thing for violence intervention. So we need to come together, pool those resources. I would commit the $200 million from the city, I would get $50 million from the state, I would get $50 million from private industry. Let's take this opportunity to actually do something about [violence] for real this time. So let's put real money towards it. We have it, and we won't in three years. But we should be saying our goal this year is to meaningfully impact 2,000 [residents]. Then next year, another 2,000. And after six months, and a year, they\u2019ll be a productive member of our community, they\u2019ll have a job, so it'll pay for itself ultimately. But the money immediately will come from federal funds that are here. Hell, I got $85 million to spend that [Lightfoot] didn't spend. We as a City Council said violence intervention is a priority. Here\u2019s $85 million. She didn\u2019t spend it. And that also speaks to the dissension; we\u2019ve lost a lot of institutional knowledge at the City, because people have just left. There\u2019s so many vacancies. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s not personal. But it\u2019s hard for us to move our city forward under this leadership, because everybody is either frustrated, moved on, and there is no sense of bringing us together as a city like, \u201cOkay, we know we\u2019ve got these challenges and issues, but how do we do it together?Do you support the SAFE-T Act?Do I support the SAFE-T Act? Yeah, I think they've got some tweaks to [do to] it . . . but in general, I do.Do you support the GoodKids MadCity Peace Book, or any other initiatives outside of policing to invest in safety for Black Chicago neighborhoods?Yeah, I do. I've told them that they need to tweak some of the budget issues, but the ideas of what they're talking about, yeah. I was the first to work with GoodKids MadCity. We put on the 1919 Project around the race riots. I brought them as well as Dr. [Timuel] Black together around that initiative.\u00a0Besides policing, [on] the violence intervention, my recommendation is $300 million per year to put a dent, and kind of long-term systemic issues to really bring people and communities back together. And by the way, that should have an impact on housing, on jobs, on all kinds of things.Does that mean increasing or decreasing the police budget in order to make that happen?I don't believe the police budget needs to be decreased at this point. I will just tell you that. Because first of all, it's hard to tell whether we have enough police or not. But I do know that they're not in the places where they need to be at the right time. I do know that there's a disproportion. I see it. I see that my police district, which had over 600 officers, now has less than 200. And by the way, District 19, which doesn't have nearly [as much] crime, has more than mine. So if we were to redistribute it, would we then have enough? Perhaps.\u00a0I think that's something that I need to take a look at. But what I see right now is that the places that need it the most don't have it, and they should have it in areas. I see how they do it up north. I see how many police are there to mitigate things before they're happening, to be able to talk to the community while they're there to really have that relationship. I think that's needed before things get bad. So, to me, there are two big things. There's the alternative responses to policing, as well as the violence intervention.Do you support Treatment Not Trauma? So it's called all of these things. So that's the mental health first responders, that's the pilot that I got money for singularly. I partnered with Ald. Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez on it, but elevated it to give to her because that's who I am as a leader.I supported it under Rahm when no other aldermen spoke up about bringing that back. So these aren\u2019t things that are new for me. They\u2019re things that are probably new to the public, because I haven\u2019t been about marketing what I do, because I wasn\u2019t doing it for that. I\u2019m okay. I don\u2019t care who gets credit. We just need to get this done. We need to have, you know, mental health first responders in the pilot and the treatment that trauma comes from that, comes from rebuilding the clinics.Mayor Lightfoot promised an elected school board, but later fought against such a board. Will you support an elected school board? And who would you think about appointing to the hybrid aspect of the board?I haven't thought about who I would appoint. But educators are important. It would be important, you know, just to find people who understand how to engage disengaged students, because that's a huge part about it. Also, we need to bring the trades and the tech industry into the schools. And I want to make clear that apprentice programs, you can only access them after you graduate, after you turn 18, and they're generally in the suburbs. They need to be brought to our schools. So I would want somebody who really understands the importance of that and the tech industry. I certainly would want people who understand the impacts of education on the community from a very deep way. Because we really, we have to bring more engagement or more after school programs.I think, ideally, it should have been smaller. It's kind of big and unwieldy. But it is what it's going to be right now. But I certainly like the elected part of it.For decades, the mayor has been at odds with the teachers union, and many rank and file teachers, staff and students who complain about the lack of resources and other\u00a0 important issues within the schools. What do you think the disconnect is there? And what will be your policy around improving CPS, especially in black and brown communities?I have a relationship with CTU. I have a relationship with most of the unions. I would probably say that I\u2019m everybody\u2019s second choice, which is okay, because it shows that I have those relationships. I think if they didn't support Brandon [Johnson], they would support me. But my bigger point is that I have that relationship with them. And I'll continue to have a relationship where you can have honest discussions about what's going on for our kids, and what's in the best interest of our kids.\u00a0Some of the big things in terms of education would be a co-curricular model. And because I come out of education, I use that vernacular, but it's really the after-school programming, to make a whole school. I think that's really important. I think we lose that opportunity to really do that. Because you've got these young babies who, you know, after school, why can't we still engage them? So disengaged students are one of the biggest hurdles that we face.\u00a0I definitely [would] make better use of the park district. There's no reason why high school students shouldn't have some engagement there. That's a missed opportunity.\u00a0I think it\u2019s super important to make sure that not only are our kids\u00a0 introduced to STEM at a very early age, but that we continue that through the job market and bring all these companies and all these universities, like Northwestern, University of Illinois, DePaul, USC. We have some of the best schools in the country, we don't take advantage of that.Historically, we've watched big developments displace and erase black communities in Chicago, and folks in the areas surrounding the upcoming Obama library, for example, are already experiencing some elements of displacement. How would you create policies to support Black residents who are being priced out by new developments, such as the Obama Presidential Center?I've already shown how I've done it. So there are four striking developments in this city, the Obama library, the 78 Lincoln yards, and the Michael Reese Hospital, and I'm over the Michael Reese development. It's being heralded by the New York Times as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But you never heard any protests. We never heard about displacement or about any of that, because we formed a Michael Reese Advisory Committee. We brought people who care about housing, who cared about all of these things to the table, and we ended up with a $25 million commitment for education for schools. We ended up with 20 percent affordable housing on site, which is unheard of. We ended up with a 60 percent commitment to diversity, mostly African American because it's in Bronzeville, we've renamed it \u2014 from Michael Reese to Bronzeville Lakefront.Many of your donors are from the Black elite professional class in Chicago. I noticed that your husband contributed $50,000 to your campaign. According to Illinois Sunshine. How are you accountable to the people who have contributed to your campaign? What did you promise them?Never promise anybody anything. I've gotten contributions in the past six-and-a-half years from different types of people from different walks of life, and I don't look at donations like that. First of all, it's illegal. And second of all, I just, I'm just a different type of person. I know what my North star is, I know why I got into this, and I know that it's not about me, or any personal gains or political gains.I've always been focused on what's best for our community, and our community means something different to me in terms of the city. But again, I still think my background, whether it's in Evanston, Mississippi, all of those things, when people talk about the Great Migration, I lived that. I had an uncle who had to leave the South go to New York, because of fear of being lynched and things of that nature. So it's part of who I am."

  "text": "Visit\u00a0The TRiiBE Election Center\u00a0to learn more about the upcoming 2023 Chicago municipal election.\u00a0Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Frank Chapman, 80, has been a revolutionary organizer since the 1960s. He is currently the educational director and field secretary at the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) and a leader in the campaign for an elected Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC). CPAC and the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) were instrumental in the fight to establish democratically elected civilian oversight of the police, which was passed in a 2021 ordinance.\u00a0In the late 1960s, the Black Panther Party sparked the first citywide attempt to establish community control of the Chicago police. It culminated in a 1973 conference that included speakers such as Dick Gregory, Fannie Lou Hamer, Renault Robinson, Bobby Seale, and Bobby Rush, as well as a ballot-measure effort to get elected, citizen-led police boards in every district. That effort was ultimately defeated by then-mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s Democratic machine.In recent years, killings by Chicago police and the widespread protests and rebellions that took place in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police reinvigorated the local movement for community control of the police. The latest chapter in organizers\u2019 efforts will come to fruition on February 28, when, for the first time ever, three people will be elected to serve on police district councils in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts.\u00a0\u00a0In 1961, Chapman was wrongfully convicted of murder and armed robbery and sentenced to 50 years in the Missouri State Penitentiary. While incarcerated, he began studying the law, reading revolutionary literature, and following the advances of the civil rights movement by reading Ebony and Jet. Chapman helped start a movement to desegregate the prison, where Black prisoners were subjected to \u201chorrid and ridiculous\u201d conditions. He reached out to politicians and activists and ultimately got in touch with Angela Davis, a key organizer in the Black Power movement and communist professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1976, Chapman was paroled and has been part of the struggle for liberation ever since. \u201cI\u2019ve stayed committed to this movement,\u201d he says, \u201cand I will continue to stay committed to it until I die.\u201d The Reader recently spoke with Chapman about the movement to establish community control of the Chicago police. What follows are his words, which have been edited for clarity and length. The struggle for community control of the police, or CCOP as it became known, started in Berkeley, California, around 1968, led by the Black Panther Party, some of the members of Students for a Democratic Society, and other progressive people in the community in the Bay Area. By the time it got to Chicago, Fred Hampton [the deputy chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party] was in the struggle and very, very conscious of what he was doing. He built the first Rainbow Coalition in this city by fighting around this issue of community control of the police.\u00a0It became a real serious campaign shortly after Chairman Fred was murdered by the police in December 1969. The campaign was really formed from a broad base. It was a multiracial coalition consisting of the Black Panther Party, the Alliance to End Repression, the NAACP, the League of Black Women, the Chicago Peace Council, the Midwest Latino Conference, and the American Indian Movement.\u00a0The goal of the CCOP was to build a people\u2019s political machine of Black, Latino, Native American, and white working-class people to take control not just of the police but of their respective communities. The campaign united and cooperated, pooling resources to attack the local power structure at all its vulnerable points, and they considered police violence and terror to be one of the most vulnerable.\u00a0They organized a voter registration drive precinct-by-precinct to get CCOP on the ballot. And we learned a number of things from that campaign, specifically that beating a powerful machine requires a tremendous amount of energy and resources and dedicated grassroots organizers. And while that [CCOP] movement had some of that, it did not have enough. In the wake of that defeat, CCOP shifted its tactics to trying to get progressive activists elected, such as Cha Cha Jimenez from the Puerto Rican Young Lords [who ran for 46th Ward alderman], or Black Panther leader Bobby Rush [who served in Congress until his retirement this month]. These candidates campaigned on a platform of greater community control by calling for such things as a community zoning board to combat gentrification, community escrow programs to combat slum lords, and other community service programs. They weren\u2019t just talking about community control of the police. By and by, these movements were diluted in terms of their demands and so on, and over a forty-year period, they were all but forgotten about.\u00a0[Winning] requires more than just having a broad concept about community control in general, and of all the different things CCOP fought for. It requires building a real, serious grassroots movement that\u2019s rooted in the neighborhoods and communities, where you have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people believing in bringing this change about and willing to fight for it. That\u2019s what our movement [Empowering Communities for Public Safety] accomplished. And we would not have accomplished this had the way not been paved for us by Fred Hampton and others.In March of 2012 Rekia Boyd, a 21-year-old Black woman, was murdered [by Dante Servin, an off-duty CPD detective]. The community was outraged about this. It happened right around the same time that Trayvon Martin was murdered [by George Zimmerman in Florida]. So there was anger in the air already. The Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and other organizers held a meeting, and we decided to launch a movement calling for an all-elected civilian police accountability council. When we started out with our first public meeting, we had about 150 people. We decided that there was a good indicator of what the people in the community want, because all those 150 people were, in fact, victims of some police crime or another.\u00a0We began to go into the communities on the south side and on the west side. For seven years, we collected signatures from people, demanding community control of the police, demanding an all-elected Civilian Police Accountability Council, known as CPAC. And in those seven years, we did not just have folks sign; we talked to people.\u00a0By the time the George Floyd rebellion broke out, we had already collected about 60,000 signatures here in the city of Chicago. We had some signatures in every ward, and we had over 1,000 signatures in 38 wards. So we were a mass movement when the George Floyd rebellion broke out. The first demonstration that we had in the wake of the George Floyd rebellion, we had over 4,000 cars in caravans and damn near 30,000 people on the ground. So that was a very massive movement that made the powers that be in the city say, \u201cOkay, we will talk to you, we will negotiate with you about doing something about this problem.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0When she was running for the office, Mayor Lightfoot said that she was going to do something about this within 90 days after she was elected, and a year later still nothing was done. A year later. So, we formed a united front with the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability, and Empowering Communities for Public Safety is what we called ourselves. That also became the name of the ordinance that we got passed: Empowering Communities for Public Safety.\u00a0That was a historic advance for our people, and it took us overcoming a lot of differences within our movement about what police accountability should look like. And so in the ECPS ordinance are some basic agreements that we had to have in order to go forward: we had to have a well-defined voice in saying who polices our communities, and that voice had to be democratically elected by the people.The first phase of that struggle, which we\u2019re now in, is getting ECPS implemented. And that means getting not just movement people but getting the people in the communities that are most devastated and impacted by police tyranny, getting those people involved in this fight and getting them to run for these positions of councilors in the police district councils.\u00a0Nothing in the history of our country has been done like this before. This is the result of us actually creating a law that empowers our people in the communities to have a\u00a0 decisive voice in saying who polices our communities and how our communities are policed, and this will be done through a democratic election.\u00a0It\u2019s never been a democratic option before for our people to say who polices our communities and how our communities are policed. We have been living under police tyranny for 100 years in this city, going all the way back to the 1919 race riots when the police joined white mobs to murder us in the streets. So this has never happened before. Not only has it never happened before in Chicago, it\u2019s never happened before in the United States.\u00a0And therefore, we put a high priority on these elections. The people who don\u2019t want this to happen are the Fraternal Order of Police and some of the alderpeople who cosign everything that they say and even, to some extent, the mayor\u2019s office itself, which was forced to come as far as they could on this. They fought us all the way. We negotiated every line of the ECPS ordinance with the mayor\u2019s office. I can tell you because I was sitting at the negotiating table. We had to fight for every line that meant something to our people. We won some of those fights, and we lost some of them.\u00a0I think the FOP realizes that they\u2019re not the most popular group in south-side and west-side communities, because people in these communities are acutely aware of the harm that they bring: they have lost family members, both in terms of being killed and brutalized. They have lost family members in terms of being incarcerated for crimes they did not commit when John Burge was operating his torture crew\u2014they tortured and forced hundreds of people to confess to crimes that they didn\u2019t commit, which means that they left hundreds of people who actually committed those crimes on the streets. So these are the abuses and excesses that have been deeply felt by the Black and Brown communities of the city, but especially the Black community. All you gotta do is look at statistics; they tell the truth, that we\u2019re overwhelmingly impacted by this, more than any other community in this city. That\u2019s why the FOP don\u2019t have a lot of [ballot petition] challenges on the south side and the west side, openly, that is, because they realize that they\u2019re not that popular in these communities where they have been the perpetrators and the defenders of police crimes for decades.What [the FOP] do have are people who they influence in these communities, who we expect them to back. We\u2019re going to beat them at the ballot box. That\u2019s where we want to beat them because we want this to be a democratic option that is used by people to get this done. So we\u2019re saying we win at the ballot box, or we\u2019ll catch the bullets later. So it\u2019s really like Malcolm X once said: \u201cthe ballot or the bullet.\u201d"

  "text": "\u201cThis guy I had a crush on worked at Carson\u2019s [Pirie Scott], and we went every single Saturday to try to bump into him at work,\u201d Grand Crossing native Sheree Anderson said, recalling her teen years. She\u2019s now 48 years old. \u201cWe had to coordinate our watches. We didn\u2019t have [cell]phones. Everybody had to look at their watch to see what time it is, and we would have to meet back at Carson\u2019s by 3 o\u2019clock.\u201dFor Anderson and her friends, once she started driving in high school, they would go to River Oaks and Evergreen Plaza to enjoy everything both malls had to offer. Being at the mall in the 1990s was a playground of freedom during those transitional years from childhood to young adulthood. Also, malls were a safe space for Black Chicagoans; many who were growing up in underserved communities with high crime rates.Being at the mall helped keep them safe while allowing them to be kids, Anderson said.\u201cThat was somewhere we could be us,\u201d Anderson explained. \u201cThe workers looked like us. I don\u2019t ever remember being there and [a stranger] followed us or anything like that.\u201dHowever, as Anderson grew into adulthood and motherhood, she witnessed a shift in mall culture. She remembers going to River Oaks in 2022, and seeing that it was a shell of what it used to be.\u00a0Although River Oaks initially opened as an outdoor mall in the 1960s, the owners at the time had plans to expand it. By the mid-1990s, owners enclosed the mall and added 80,000 square feet along with new tenants, making River Oaks the largest indoor mall in the South suburbs, according to Crain\u2019s Chicago Business.Namdar Realty Group and partner Mason Asset Management bought the 1.3 million square-foot River Oaks for $26.3 million in 2017, according to Crain\u2019s.But the mall faced many challenges in its later years. In 2013, two of the mall\u2019s anchors \u2014 Carson Pirie Scott and Sears \u2014 closed. And its home, Calumet City, lost about 5 percent of its population between 2000 and 2017.\u00a0To reinvigorate the mall today, Calumet City mayor Thaddeus Jones wants to build an indoor water park on the former site of the Sears store. There is a proposal on the table to create a new section of the mall called Southland Live Casino, where a new 150,000-square-feet casino and entertainment complex would be built near Macy\u2019s.\u201cYou want your child to experience some of the things you\u2019ve experienced,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cMy daughter and her friends [are] not going to experience a mall shop.\u201dWith online shopping and thrifting increasingly growing in popularity over the years, mall culture has shifted. For many, the mall is simply not the first priority for shopping as it once was in decades past. \n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.The shift started before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2016, according to a Pew Research Center survey, roughly eight out of 10 Americans shopped online. During the same survey in 2000, just 22 percent of Americans had made an online purchase.\u00a0Add in the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to many major and minor retailers shuttering across the country. Nowadays, due to pandemic-era habits such as hybrid work, many malls across the country are undergoing a transition into lifestyle centers; mixed-use spaces resembling urban promenades that are anchored by restaurants and entertainment, according to ModernRetail.In Chicago, specifically, add in the increased policing of youth, curfews and incidents of violence that sometimes take place at the mall. This also makes the mall an unattractive place for young adults, a population that historically has frequented and spent money at the mall.\u201cThe Water Tower used to be cool, but it got weird when too many kids used to go there and they started banning kids,\u201d 23-year-old Kendall Mensah said. \u201cThe rules shied me away.\u201dAlthough people don\u2019t share the same excitement for malls as they once did, many in the Chicagoland area still hold their memories close to their heart, including those adventures of taking dreamshots at Magic Photos and buying outfits at streetwear stores like The Lark, DTLR and Jimmy Jazz.Growing up in the early 2000s, South Side native Jawuan Johnson, 28, recalled having a successful second date ever at North Riverside Mall in Chicago\u2019s western suburb.\u00a0\u201cIt was like the club for us,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe just went to a mall to mess around and hang out for a cool vibe.\u201dWest Englewood native Sheryl Coleman, 48, reminisced about her memories at the strip of stores along 63rd & Halsted, and at Evergreen Plaza; the latter she affectionately called by its generational nickname, \u201cEver Black.\u201d Both shopping areas allowed her to express herself through fashion. She collected starter jackets, starter hats and the hottest gym shoes way before the hypebeasts and sneaker culture.\u201cI purchased my first Dooney & Bourke bag by myself at Evergreen Plaza,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cIt felt like a rite of passage that you were being allowed the opportunity to do things by yourself, and the safest place to do something by yourself was the mall.\u201dEvergreen Plaza, located on the border of Chicago and south suburban Evergreen Park, first opened as an open-air mall in the 1950s and later enclosed in the 1960s. But soon, it too struggled with changing times and closures. Anchor stores such as Montgomery Wards and Circuit City went bankrupt and shuttered, and incidents of crime led to its movie theater closing and being demolished in the 2000s.\u00a0"

  "title": "The Era hosts its first Youth Footwork Festival on Dec. 4",
  "text": "The three-hour event is free for all ages and will feature the range of art and cultural expression that encompasses the world of footworking. There will workshops teaching media production and fashion design, along with \u201cfootwork stations\u201d where youth can take turns learning the artform from one another.Door open at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, Dec. 4 at 4116 N. Hamlin Ave., an art studio in the Irving Park neighborhood. The first two hours of the event will be youth rotating freely between footwork stations and workshops. The final hour will include a team footwork battle and youth performance curated and choreographed by The Era in partnership with Open The Circle, a nonprofit focused on community organizing and racial justice through the arts.Jamal \u201cLitebulb\u201d Oliver is co-executive director of Open The Circle and co-founder of The Era. The TRiiBE spoke with him about the festival and the importance of finding creative ways to encourage the youth.(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: Walk me through what the Footwork Youth Festival is?Jamal \u201cLitebulb\u201d Oliver: We was fortunate enough to win a grant from Arts Work Fund earlier this year for about $25,000. And we were supposed to create a new piece for it. And we were, like, man it\u2019s gonna take a lot to create a brand new piece, because In the Wurkz was such a large production. So it was like, You know what, let\u2019s find a way to reinvest into the kids.The initial grant was to create some choreography with some youth involved. We were, like, well, let\u2019s just take ourselves out of it completely and just create an event with kids. Let\u2019s add a battle component. And then Manny [of The Era] was, like, \u2018ah, why don\u2019t we just make it a festival, we can media and we can add fashion with Steelo [of The Era].\u2019 I was like that could possibly work.So I had some conversations with my team, Wills [Glasspiegel] and everybody over at Open Circle. And they became more of a presenting partner so that we could cipher the funds through them. Now it is a full fledged festival with us creating new choreography with the kids to present a piece at this event.We had tryouts for this. It was an opportunity to pay the kids. They\u2019re all being paid like official artists to be a part of this show. We\u2019re just teaching them choreography and whatnot.We found a space and started practicing with them. We found about eight kids \u2014 90% of them are girls. Two of them are young guys. We found a way to include Manny\u2019s media component by finding kids who are interested in media. They have been learning about media over the last two months since we started rehearsals. Pretty much recording every practice. Shooting all the different background footage and all the different interviews with each other; pieces we\u2019ll be using in the show. We also have a group of kids who are learning fashion for Steelo and there will be a booth at the festival where kids will be printing t-shirts and talking about that experience of how they got into fashion and footwork.Is the Footwork Youth Festival open to the public? Can other kids join?Litebulb: Yes. The festival is completely open to the public. It\u2019s free.For the kids who attend the event but haven\u2019t been working with y\u2019all already, will they get a chance to participate in the workshops?Litebulb: It\u2019s for people who are part of the footwork community and friends and family. You can come and be around footwork and see what it\u2019s like for kids to be around it and learn. Anybody can come and learn footwork from the kids here. It\u2019s definitely open to everybody who is willing to come and learn. It\u2019s very interactive.A lot of us grew up around footworking; either watching or participating in the random battles that could break out anytime in the hood, at basement parties or at school. As kids, it didn\u2019t seem like something we could make a career out of. But y\u2019all figured that out and have been successful at showing the many opportunities footwork can bring. How important is it to teach the endless possibilities of footwork to kids?Litebulb: For me, when I was their age, I was just battling. So to even be, like, \u2018Hey, you can come and learn footwork, but you\u2019re also being paid to perform, being paid to practice, being paid to be here all the time,\u2019 this is gonna lead to other opportunities. There\u2019s opportunity for you to gain some value and add it to your resume.These kids are busy. These kids are in fifty-million dance practice. They be tagging. They\u2019re more busy than both of us. I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re doing all of those things for free for the most part. So to give them an opportunity like this, I feel like it starts the process early and\u00a0 it creates a new window for kids other than pursuing sports or the typical things that we gravitate towards.We incorporate a lot of financial literacy and we will be incorporating a lot more financial economics into footwork because these same modalities can be used in other industries that lack the resources or, when they do get resources, they don\u2019t even know what to do with them.Black people, and especially Black kids in the hood, always set the tone for what culture is and what culture is going to be. But then we see it get appropriated and turned into some en vogue, high fashion stuff. And then when we try to make money off of it ourselves, it\u2019s too late.Litebulb: It\u2019s too late. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s happening within footwork while we was on the watch. I want to say that it is in footwork. People are doing that in footwork. I\u2019d be lying if I said that they wasn\u2019t doing it. But it\u2019s the reason why you work with the kids in your community. I live in this neighborhood (Burnside) and some of these kids live around me. So for me to be able to provide opportunity for those kids, it\u2019s gives them the opportunity so that we\u2019re not even competing with each other for opportunities.Most of these kids that we know, that aren\u2019t Black, they don\u2019t necessarily need to profit off of it or necessarily need to have this as their job. We know that disadvantaged kids need these opportunities more so than the ones who come from well-driven homes.Malls have tightened up its restrictions on kids being able to hang in them without parents or guardians after a certain time. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened up on curfews in the summer, adding more restrictions around when and where kids can be at a certain time. It feels like kids are taking so many hits in Chicago. It feels like kids are taking so many hits in Chicago right now, not to mention the violence we\u2019re constantly being hit with. With the Footwork Youth Festival, how can we see more people breathe more life into kids and teenagers? How can your program show that our culture and our kids are not to be written off as violent?Litebulb: A lot of these kids don\u2019t have a lot of opportunities to do anything when you really think about it, other than dance a lot of the time. A lot of them don\u2019t have a lot of money to do things. That kind of affects their behaviors a little bit, and how they act sometimes. They end up outside all day. They don\u2019t have nothing to do; no after-school programs.I feel like more opportunity and more education around financial literacy is really the key, even for adults, but mainly for the kids. They just don\u2019t understand what to do with anything at this stage. They\u2019re tech-saavy. But the opportunity to even use those skills are not there unless they just become social-media famous, and that\u2019s toxic in itself when you think about it. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. But I know that it\u2019s rooted in opportunity.The more opportunities you can provide children that are interactive and creative, and it draws them out of their normal comfort zones. There\u2019s not a lot of spaces out here either to house community events and house things for kids. I feel like space and opportunity, and that sounds so simple and cliche. But space and opportunity for these kids, and guidance, we\u2019re gonna win. It can steer these kids in a whole different way that we probably wouldn\u2019t be ready for. A festival like this is providing just that.What do you hope everybody gets out of the Footwork Youth Festival?"

  "text": "Housing advocates with the BCH coalition need aldermanic support to get a ballot measure approved that would ask Chicago voters if the city should increase the real-estate transfer tax for buyers who purchase residential or commercial properties for more than $1 million. Those funds would be redirected toward efforts to combat homelessness.\u00a0The resolution is currently in Chicago\u2019s City Council\u2019s rules committee and, with the City Council\u2019s approval, could become a ballot question in the upcoming February 2023 municipal election.\u00a0The resolution was on Tuesday\u2019s agenda for the rules committee, as were two other ballot measures. However, that meeting was canceled hours before the committee was set to meet.\u00a0And on Monday, a special meeting for the City Council took place to discuss the BCH proposal.\u00a0The meeting was scheduled to start at 9 a.m. but was moved to 11:30 a.m. because there weren\u2019t enough City Council members to discuss the proposal.\u00a0That meeting was scheduled by sponsors of the resolution, including Alds: Maria Hadden (49th Ward), Carlos Ramirez Rosa (35th Ward), Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Matt Martin (47th Ward) and Andre Vasquez (40th Ward).\u00a0Hadden said the meeting was a hearing to allow members of the public and City Council members to weigh in on the resolution. She added that they weren\u2019t asking council members to vote on the resolution.\u00a0Only 19 City Council members were present at the first meeting, but at least 26 needed to be present to move forward with the meeting.\u00a0\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t want to have a real estate transfer tax increase for a variety of reasons. So, even though we weren\u2019t asking council members to vote on the issue, there are some people who didn\u2019t want to aid the cause in any way. There were also a bunch of people who said they would come for the hearing because it is our job to show up for City Council meetings,\u201d Hadden told The TRiiBE on Nov. 15, referring to City Council members who weren\u2019t present for the meeting.\u00a0At 11:30 a.m on Monday, the meeting started for a second time, but there still weren\u2019t enough City Council members to move forward. This time, 25 members were present\u2014just one person shy of the 26-member requirement for a quorum.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m disgusted, hurt and upset at the 25 other alderpeople that did not show up [and] hid like cowards, because they\u2019d rather do what the mayor [Mayor Lori Lightfoot] tells them to do than do their job. They should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said April Harris, a grassroots leader of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless.\n         During her 2023 budget address, Mayor Lightfoot proposed $200 million in investments for the homeless. However, housing advocates say a one-time payment isn\u2019t enough to solve the problem.Harris and other BCH coalition members were present at City Hall on Monday and were prepared to give public comment during Monday\u2019s meeting. But because there wasn\u2019t a quorum, the meeting adjourned and they weren\u2019t allowed to speak.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you an alderperson if you don\u2019t care about your ward or what\u2019s going on in your ward?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\u00a0The BCH coalition has been pushing its proposal since 2019.The ballot measure would ask Chicago voters if the city should increase the real estate transfer tax by 253 percent for buyers who purchase residential or commercial properties for more than $1 million. Those funds would be redirected from the city to combat homelessness by providing permanent affordable housing and the services necessary to obtain and maintain permanent housing in Chicago.The future of the BCH\u2019s proposal is up in the air. Hadden explained that time is of the essence for the measure to be added to February\u2019s municipal election ballot. To be included on the ballot, the City Council would have to vote and approve it before the Chicago Board of Elections\u2019 Dec. 11 deadline, Hadden explained.\u201cBecause there\u2019s a deadline, no matter what the issue is, if it\u2019s not approved by a certain date, it can\u2019t be on the ballot,\u201d she said.\u00a0If the next City Council meeting were to take place on Dec. 7 and the resolution was approved for a vote, then there would still be enough time for it to be included on the February ballot. At the time this article was being published, the next full meeting for the body is Dec. 14, according to the city clerk\u2019s website.\u00a0Hadden, like Harris, is frustrated with how things have unfolded this week in the City Council.\u201cThe urgency of City Council and the mayor needing to act\u2014I can\u2019t understate it, so it\u2019s deeply frustrating. Not to have people disagree with the solution we\u2019re offering but to prevent us from moving forward and not have an alternative,\u201d Hadden said.\u00a0This year, Hadden said, at least 15-30 people in her ward who are experiencing homelessness live in Touhy Park. Her ward includes Rogers Park and parts of the West Ridge neighborhood.\u00a0She also reiterated that the city needs a dedicated fund to address homelessness.\u201cIf we had more money, we could be doing more rental assistance regularly, and I\u2019d have fewer people living in [Touhy Park] right now. It\u2019s not a fault or failure of our programs; it is a gap in the amount of money that we\u2019ve got. And so right now, we have a lot of money that we\u2019re using, and it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhat happens when that money is gone?\u201d\u00a0Hadden is referring to funds from the Chicago Recovery Plan. This plan includes funding from the American Rescue Act, also known as the COVID-19 stimulus package. President Joe Biden signed the economic stimulus bill into law in March 2021. The city of Chicago was given about $1.9 billion from Congress in 2021. The city has until 2025 to use those funds, she added.\u00a0\u201cSo that\u2019s really the challenge I put out there to colleagues, to the [Lightfoot] administration, to folks who don\u2019t want to see the real estate transfer tax increase.How are you going to help us find $150 [million] to $200 million a year for the services that Chicagoans desperately need?\u201d she asked.\u00a0"

  "title": "2023 Chicago Police District Councils Voter Guide",
  "text": "This story was originally published by The Chicago Reader & South Side WeeklyAfter decades of struggle by thousands of people who organized, marched, petitioned, prayed, and collectively clamored for the right to have a say in how their communities are policed, on February 28 voters will elect 66 people to serve on police district councils across the city.The battle for community control of the police has been waged for more than a half-century. Deputy chairman Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party sparked the first push in the late 1960s (see\u00a0Fifty years of struggle). In the decades since, organizers have won incremental concessions. The Office of Professional Standards was created within the police department in 1974. It was replaced by the Independent Police Review Authority in 2007, which was in turn replaced by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability a decade later. Each agency was created thanks to the tireless efforts of ordinary Chicagoans. None of the people serving on them were democratically elected.\u00a0The police district councils will be elected. Three councilors will serve in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts for four-year terms. They\u2019ll be tasked with building connections between police and communities, developing community policing initiatives, getting community input on CPD policies, and ensuring the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) hears the community\u2019s concerns.The Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that created the councils and the CCPSA is the result of\u00a0 a decade of organizing spurred by the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd by Dante Servin, an off-duty police detective, in Douglass Park. Servin, found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter because the judge determined he\u2019d shot Boyd intentionally, resigned from the department with a pension. In response to that killing, organizers began the push for community control of police anew.In the ensuing years, as high-profile killings by police across the country mounted, they catalyzed the Black Lives Matter movement, a nationwide effort to get government officials to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stem the epidemic of violence wrought upon Black and Brown communities by the very officers tasked with keeping them safe. In Chicago and elsewhere, the police kept killing people. The victims were often unarmed, and they were almost always Black.\u00a0In 2014, then-officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him. When video footage of the shooting was released, thousands of Chicagoans protested downtown, shutting down the Magnificent Mile during Black Friday and staging a sit-in at the office of State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez, who activists said had mishandled the prosecutions of both Van Dyke and Servin. In the wake of the protests, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, and the U.S. Department of Justice placed the CPD under a federal consent decree.Everything changed in 2020, as protests of the murder of George Floyd by then-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin swept the nation.\u00a0In Chicago and elsewhere, the rebellions (and the police response to them) turned into a long, hot summer. In its midst, the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression formed a coalition, Empowering Communities for Public Safety. With thousands of ordinary people at its back and in the streets, the coalition negotiated the language of the ECPS ordinance with the mayor. It passed in 2021.Chicagoans have been promised police reform before, and the department\u2019s entrenched attitude against change could make some wonder how effective the district councils will be. One clue to the power they may wield lies in who\u2019s on the ballot. In addition to ordinary residents and dedicated activists, several candidates with law enforcement ties are running. And the Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s election attorney filed challenges to several progressive candidates\u2019 ballot petitions, is listed as the contact person for six more on Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (CBEC) filings, and is himself running.\u00a0We\u00a0sent questionnaires to district council candidates, interviewed as many as we could reach, and researched their backgrounds using sources ranging from social media to biographies compiled by the ECPS coalition. We\u2019ve compiled the responses below. Early voting begins on January 26 at the CBEC supersite, and on February 13 in all 50 wards.\u00a0\u2014Jim DaleyAn attorney, Brown graduated from the Catholic University of America and Columbus School of Law.

  "text": "As of 1 p.m. on Nov. 9, the Chicago Board of Elections (CBOE) reported that 98% of the 6th Ward residents voted in favor of Treatment Not Trauma. The 6th Ward includes Chatham, Englewood, Park Manor and Greater Grand Crossing neighborhoods.\u00a0While 96% of voters in the 20th Ward said \u201cyes\u201d to the measure and 92% of residents in the 33rd Ward. The 20th Ward encompasses Woodlawn and parts of Washington Park, Englewood and Back of the Yards. And the 33rd Ward including Albany Park, Ravenswood Manor, Irving Park and Avondale neighborhoods.\u00a0In 2012, mayor Rahm Emanuel closed six of the city\u2019s twelve mental health clinics, four of them were located on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cThere should be political will to invest in communities the way we need and know is possible,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn wrote in a Collaborative for Community Wellness press release following\u00a0 the election results on Tuesday night. She is a 20th Ward resident and a community organizer.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve personally talked to hundreds of my neighbors on this issue\u2014from healthcare workers, to my own loved ones, to elders and youth\u2014and what we\u2019ve heard is a resounding desire for City investment in mental health, not more policing,\u201d she continued.\n        Millennials came in second to Boomers during Tuesday\u2019s midterm election in Chicago.Although the Treatment Not Trauma ballot referendum isn\u2019t binding, meaning it will not be enacted as a law, it does demonstrate Chicago voters\u2019 support for free and accessible mental health services in underserved communities.\u00a0Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward) first introduced the \u00a0\u201cTreatment Not Trauma\u201d ordinance to the city council\u2019s Health and Human Relations committee in 2020.\u00a0As written, the ordinance would establish 24-hour crisis response teams within the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and deploy them citywide. The response teams would be equipped with a clinical social worker, emergency medical professional, or registered nurse.\u00a0If approved by Chicago City Council, the crisis response teams would respond to mental health calls instead of Chicago police officers. According to a WBEZ news report, CPD officers responded to more than 41,000 calls with a \u201cmental health component\u201d in 2019.\u00a0Treatment Not Trauma is modeled after a similar program in Eugene, Oregon called CAHOOTS. It\u2019s been running for over 30 years. According to a separate 2015 report by the Treatment Advocacy Center,\u201cpeople with severe mental illness are 16 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than people without mental illness.\u201d\u00a0Although the Treatment Not Trauma ordinance has not been moved out of committee or been brought to the Chicago City Council floor, a two-year pilot program called the Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement program (CARE) is already underway.\u00a0CDPH launched CARE in September 2021. The program has two teams based on the North and South sides. These teams respond around the clock to mental-health calls in 13 neighborhoods across Chicago. Each CARE team includes a police officer, a paramedic and mental-health crisis intervention professional. In addition, the team responds to mental health emergency calls."

  "title": "Despite judge\u2019s ruling, GKMC will continue its peacekeeping activity in Hyde Park for Halloween",
  "text": "Since 2018, the youth-led organization has hosted a peacekeeping and cop-watching activity on Halloween in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In their lawsuit filed on Oct. 26, GKMC argued that the citywide curfew prevents their members, majority of which are under age 18, from carrying out its Halloween activity.\u201cGKMC members fear that if they participate in these activities during curfew hours, CPD officers will subject them to arrest, harassment and/or police violence,\u201d the lawsuit stated.In 2018, CBS Chicago reported that at least 100 young people were out in Hyde Park on Halloween, vandalizing cars, harassing people attending a street festival and robbing University of Chicago students. Police said 11 juveniles and one adult were arrested for reckless conduct for an incident at 53rd and Lake Park that evening.Some of GKMC\u2019s peacekeeping work on Halloween includes mediating disputes between teens, facilitating peace circles, creating peaceful and positive spaces for youth on Halloween, cop watching and informing youth of their constitutional rights in case they are approached by police, according to court documents.\u201cWe talk to them and tell them who we are, what we represent, why we\u2019re here to support them, and how not to engage with the police,\u201d GKMC Miracle Boyd told The TRiiBE on Oct. 31, following U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis\u2019s ruling.\u00a0For instance, there may be young people out on Halloween who are unaware that there is a new city curfew in place, or who may be responsible for younger relatives who don\u2019t have an adult to accompany them.\u00a0 \u201cWe also tell them they don\u2019t have to engage the police and tell them where the activities will be happening, and if they need help, who to reach out to,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe give them information so that they can inform themselves when confronted by a police officer.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.On May 25, the Chicago City Council passed Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s ordinance to extend and expand a citywide curfew for youth, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and Brown children.\u00a0\u00a0Under the ordinance, curfew begins daily at 10:00 p.m. \u2014 instead of the previous 11:00 p.m. time. It also includes minors under age 18. Previously, the curfew applied to minors ages 12 through 16. For children ages 12 and younger, their curfew remained the same: 8:30 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and 9:00 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.\u00a0Curfew exceptions are granted to youth coming from ticketed or sponsored events. However, they must be able to show documentation of their attendance if asked by authorities.That same month, Lightfoot also issued an executive order at Millennium Park requiring visitors under 18 to be accompanied by an adult after 6:00 p.m. on Thursday through Sunday nights.A Block Club Chicago analysis of CPD data found that the city\u2019s youth curfew was mostly enforced on the South and West sides and had little effect on crime. Grand Central, the 25th Police District covering parts of the Northwest and West sides, recorded the most reports, with 28.In the Oct. 31 ruling, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said there wasn\u2019t a need to issue a temporary restraining order for the city\u2019s youth curfew ordinance. However, she argued that GKMC\u2019s peacekeeping activities are protected under the first amendment, while attorneys representing the city in the lawsuit disagreed with that notion.\u00a0During the hearing, city attorney Bradley Wilson said that CPD officers in the second police district, Wentworth, have been advised to review the city\u2019s ordinance, along with a second order CPD Special Order S06-04-09, to ensure that de-escalation steps are employed before the curfew is enforced or any further action is taken.\u00a0In response to questions from The TRiiBE about department guidelines for de-escalation techniques as they encounter young people, and whether more officers will be deployed in the second district on Halloween, a CPD spokesperson said:\u201cThe Chicago Police Department regularly reviews and adjusts resources to ensure Districts across the city have sufficient staffing. We will have a comprehensive plan in place to maintain public safety citywide during Halloween,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in the email.\u00a0\u00a0According to the lawsuit, GKMC\u2019s presence on Halloween is considered a \u201cnon-traditional first amendment activity.\u201d Lawyers asked for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to keep Chicago Police Department (CPD) officers from enforcing the city\u2019s curfew against GKMC members and other young people who participate.Although the outcome was not what they desired, civil rights attorneys Sheila Bedi and Kara Cutcher said the Ellis\u2019 ruling affirms that peacekeeping is a protected first amendment activity. Both represented GKMC in the suit.\u00a0\u201cWhat was clear, though, is that the city was unwilling to concede that peacekeeping is a protected first amendment activity. And the court made it very clear that, in the court\u2019s view, peacekeeping is protected under the first amendment and that the city should be advising its officers not to enforce the curfew against young people who are engaging in acts of peacekeeping,\u201d Bedi told The TRiiBE. \u201cSo that was an important clarification that the city was unwilling to concede prior to this morning. The city was essentially saying the curfew was enough and that it\u2019s constitutional.\u201dBoyd estimates that hundreds of young people come to Hyde Park on Halloween to celebrate each year because it is an affluent community with neighbors who buy the best candy.\u00a0She added that the number of young people in Hyde Park on Halloween has decreased over the years because of the heavy police presence. According to the Hyde Park Herald, no one was arrested in Hyde Park on Halloween in 2020 and 2021. Various community groups, including GKMC, were present along 53rd Street for peacekeeping and copwatching in 2021, Hyde Park Herald reported.\u00a0\u201cKids just want to have a good time. Some neighbors in Hyde Park and the police militarize instead of providing activities for them to engage in. So that creates anticipation and anxiety,\u201d Boyd said.\u00a0"

  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "For the first time, residents across the city will elect members to the councils representing their police districts, just as they elect an alderperson to represent their wards. There are 22 Chicago police districts.This new city office was born out of last year\u2019s historic Chicago City Council vote to create a new model for police oversight, accountability and public safety. The approved Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance created two bodies: a city-wide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and the police District Councils.\u00a0On Aug. 29, Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced the interim members of the CCPSA. Of the 14 candidates nominated by the Chicago City Council, Lightfoot chose seven to serve on the interim commission until the summer or fall of 2023. That\u2019s when the newly-elected members of the police District Councils will nominate 14 candidates for the permanent commission. The mayor then will choose seven, and the Chicago City Council must confirm them.Anyone interested in running for a police District Council seat will have until Nov. 28 to collect between 300 and 700 signatures, depending on the number of registered voters in each police district.\u00a0\u201cThere are 22 police districts. In every district, there will be three different people elected to serve as a representative for that police district. So that\u2019s 66 people tasked with public safety and accountability for the police in their specific area,\u201d LaCreshia Birts told The TRiiBE on July 26. She is a coordinator at the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA), a citywide broad-based coalition of community organizations that works to improve public safety, police practices and police accountability.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s powerful to have that many people taking on that role and thinking about public safety,\u201d she added.For Chicago, with its decades-long history of police misconduct and abuse, the CCPSA is a step in the right direction. CPD is still under a federal consent decree, a court-mandated overhaul of the department\u2019s policies. The 2014 murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by former Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke sparked an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice which, in a 2017 report, revealed decades of racist police misconduct and use of excessive force by CPD.Enacted in 2019, the consent decree was supposed to last for five years. In March, it was extended out to eight years. The early years of the consent decree were beset by missed deadlines and lagging compliance, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThe police district councils will provide a strong policymaking body that we can use to change police policies,\u201d Frank Chapman told The TRiiBE on Aug. 9. He\u2019s the national director of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) and a member of the ECPS coalition that developed the ordinance.\u00a0Chapman said the ordinance\u2019s passage gives Chicago communities a say in how they\u2019re policed. This is especially important for Black and brown people who disproportionately experience police crimes and abuse.\n        Chicago organizers break down what the creation of a civilian oversight board means for a city with a long history of police misconduct.What are the CCPSA\u2019s powers?The ECPS ordinance created two entities: a citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and police District Councils.\u00a0The commission can evaluate the performance of the police superintendent, any member of the police board, or the COPA chief administrator. In addition, the commission can recommend candidates for police superintendent and the Chicago Police Board, but the mayor still retains the power to hire and fire the police superintendent and Chicago Police Board members. However, the commission does have the power to hire and fire the COPA head.\u00a0The commission can also vote on police department policies, review and recommend changes to CPD\u2019s budget before City Council vote, establish goals and evaluate the progress of the police superintendent and CPD, chief administrator, COPA, the Chicago Police Board president and the police board members.\u00a0Beginning in the summer or fall of 2023, elected community members that serve on police District Councils will nominate 14 candidates to serve on the permanent commission. Then the Mayor will choose seven of them. They must be confirmed by the City Council.A full listing of the commission\u2019s powers can be found here.\u00a0Who makes up the current seven-member interim CCPSA?\u00a0According to a written press release, Lightfoot selected interim commissioners based on their professional experience, community leadership, experience with the criminal legal system and ability to work collaboratively with others. Commissioners will serve four-year terms and receive a stipend of $12,000 per year. The president of the commission who will be selected by the commissioners will receive a stipend of $15,000 per year.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very happy that of the seven the Mayor picked, four are members of our [ECPS] coalition. Four of the individuals are on the frontlines of fighting for this civilian oversight ordinance. And so to me, that tells me they are right for this interim commission,\u201d Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa (35th Ward) said during a press conference at City Hall on Aug. 30. Ramirez-Rosa is one of the ordinance\u2019s sponsors.\u00a0Below are more details about the interim community commission members.\u00a0Anthony Driver Jr.A community activist and public affairs specialist.South Side resident.Previously served as the Political & Legislative Coordinator for SEIU Healthcare ILLead organizer for the Raise Chicago Coalition, where he advocated for raising the Chicago minimum wage to $15.Driver has a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Howard University.\u00a0Oswaldo GomezA West Side resident.Community organizer and a youth/emerging adult representative on the CCPSA.Graduate student at the University of Chicago, pursuing a degree in public policy.Worked extensively with the GAPA and ECPS Coalition to create the CCPSAHe grew up in Humboldt Park and has seen firsthand the need for civilian oversight.\u00a0He hopes to encourage young people to engage in the ongoing conversations on police reform and to set the foundation for a successful oversight system for years to come.\u00a0Rev. Dr. Beth BrownA North Side resident.A pastor in the Presbyterian Church for the past 30 years and is currently the pastor at Lincoln Park Presbyterian Church.As a pastor, she has worked on justice issues relating to mental health, public safety, community organizing, civil rights, and advocacy on behalf of marginalized populations.\u00a0As a queer pastor, she has advocated for LGBTQIA+ people inside and outside of the church for over 20 years.She is a passionate advocate for police reform. She believes that the police department and officers need to be held accountable at every level by creating policies and procedures about public safety and accountability.\u00a0Yvette LoizonPartner at Clifford Law Offices. Former Assistant State\u2019s Attorney with extensive legal and public service experience.South Side resident.Served as Chief Legal Counsel to the Illinois State Police. She was responsible for supporting numerous public safety initiatives and ensuring law enforcement accountability in civil, criminal, and administrative contexts.A 20-year resident of Beverly and a mother of four children, she is deeply connected to the concerns raised by Chicagoans citywide.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She is committed to fostering enhanced confidence and trust in law enforcement and those who make decisions related to law enforcement practices.\u00a0Cliff NellisWest Side residentFounder and Executive Director of the Lawndale Christian Legal Center (LCLC).In 2009, Cliff Nellis moved into the North Lawndale community and helped found the Lawndale Christian Legal Center with the mission of providing integrated legal and social services to court-involved youth.Lives in North Lawndale with his three children.Remel TerryWest Side resident.Community leader.Currently, she serves as the 2nd Vice President of the Chicago Westside NAACP.She has also partnered with various grassroots organizations to address issues of inequity in legislation and enforcement, economic advancement, education, American legal system reform, health, affordable housing and political action.\u00a0Isaac TroncosoNorth Side resident.He will serve as the community advocate youth/emerging adult representative on the commission.He seeks to amplify the voices of young people in the policymaking space and give them a collective seat at the table.\u00a0Through his time working on Chicago-area political campaigns, and in his nonprofit volunteering and Board service, Troncoso has worked with Chicagoans from across the city, from a diverse array of backgrounds.\u00a0He has worked with small business owners and youth affected by our criminal justice system.Understanding the role of police District Councils\u00a0The ECPS ordinance also creates three-member district councils for the city\u2019s 22 police districts. Members of the councils will be elected by residents who reside in the district during the 2023 Chicago municipal elections.\u00a0District Council members have four-year terms. They will work directly with the police district and report their findings to the commission. Most important of the District Council\u2019s powers is the ability to nominate members for the commission.\u00a0\u201cThese are elected positions. They can only be elected by people who live in the police district. So we have to go all out to ensure that our people are adequately represented in these councils,\u201d Chapman said.\u00a0District Council members\u2019 responsibilities include: building stronger connections between police and the community and at the police district level, collaborating in the development and implementation of community policing initiatives, holding public meetings, meeting with community members to get their input on police department strategies and practices, creating and expanding restorative justice and other programs in the police district, and more.\u00a0District Council members may require a time commitment of about 20 hours per month and receive a monthly $500 stipend.\u00a0A full description of the District Council\u2019s duties can be found here.\u00a0Interested in running for a police District Council seat? Here\u2019s what you should knowSignature collection for candidates interested in running for any office in the Chicago municipal elections began on Aug. 30. Candidates must submit signed nominating petitions to the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners between Nov. 21, 2022, and Nov. 28, 2022.\u00a0For those interested in running for a seat on the police District Council, the specific eligibility requirements are:\u00a0More detailed information about the 2023 municipal election and calendar can be found on the Chicago Board of Elections website or here.\u00a0Chapman and the CAARPR have hosted free weekly virtual ECPS candidate training workshops since last December to educate Chicago residents about the ECPS ordinance, the CCPSA and the police District Council elections.\u00a0"

  "title": "Unpacking the mistrust some gun violence victims\u2019 families have in Kim Foxx",
  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"

  "title": "\u201cHe\u2019s escaping accountability,\u201d Chicago organizer Miracle Boyd speaks out after police officer who attacked her resigns",
  "text": "On Wednesday, July 13, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) announced that Officer Nicholas Jovanovich had resigned from CPD as a result of the assault. The police oversight agency recommended that he be fired from the police force after it concluded its investigation last year.\u00a0\n        The TRiiBE asked one central question: If you could say anything to Mayor Lightfoot and CPD after Friday\u2019s protest, what would you say?Instead, Jovanovich resigned in April 2022 before he could be terminated from CPD. In March, CPD Supt. David Brown went to the Chicago Police Board and \u201cunsuccessfully argued for leniency,\u201d according to a Chicago Tribune news report. His resignation means that his fate will not be decided by a vote from the Chicago Police Board.\u00a0\u201cWe recently received notification that the accused officer facing separation in this incident resigned from the Department,\u201d COPA first deputy Ephraim Eaddy said in a written statement on Wednesday.Boyd learned about Jovanovich\u2019s resignation from her attorney on Wednesday.\u201cI was a bit shocked, but I kind of wasn\u2019t at the same time. It just came out of the blue that he had resigned. So it\u2019s like I can\u2019t believe it, like are you serious? So the first thing I thought of was [he\u2019s] escaping accountability,\u201d Boyd told The TRiiBE today.\u00a0\u201cHe can be a police officer with another police department in another city and state, and the atrocious events that happened to me will not even be on his record,\u201d Boyd added.A 2020 paper in the Yale Law Journal called them \u201cwandering officers,\u201d those who are fired by one department, sometimes for misconduct, but go on to be hired by another police department. This month, former Cleveland police Officer Timothy Loehmann was sworn into a Pennsylvania police department eight years after he fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014; he quickly left the position after media attention and public outrage. The Pennsylvania attorney general said his hiring violated state law because the department didn\u2019t perform a background check.The incident occurred during the Decolonize Zhigaagoong protest on July 17, 2020. Boyd, then 18 years old, was one of the speakers during the rally that drew a crowd of about 1,000 near the Buckingham Fountain. Following the rally, the group marched to the Christopher Columbus statue when armed CPD officers surrounded the statue.\u201cI was initially leaving the protest early,\u201d Boyd told The TRiiBE days after the protest in 2020. \u201cI was about 100 feet from the protest when I started to hear what I thought were gunshots. I went to go see what was happening without getting into the crowd at all.\u201dContributor Kelly Garcia reported the details of what happened to Boyd for The TRiiBE.The sound of gunshots Boyd thought she was hearing were the fireworks going off at the Columbus statue that police officers were protecting. Reports say protestors were throwing water bottles and soda cans at police.\u00a0\u201cSo I started recording on Facebook Live and that\u2019s when I saw my friend crying near a police officer, so I headed over,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I noticed a guy who was being arrested and I tried to get his full name right before an officer smacked me.\u201dAs Boyd was recording the arrest on her phone, Jovanovich extended his left arm and hit Boyd\u2019s cell phone from her hand, which caused the phone to hit her face and resulted in several injuries, COPA said.\u00a0She said that one of her front teeth was knocked out, and the force was so severe that she had to undergo root canals for her two front teeth before she could get six veneers put in place. She also experienced nerve damage.A viral cell phone video from another protestor captured Boyd being hit in the mouth.\u00a0In June 2021, COPA concluded its investigation of the incident and delivered its findings to Supt. Brown. COPA said Jovanovich used unnecessary and excessive force when he struck Boyd without justification and that he made one or more false and misleading statements when reporting on the incident.\u00a0Brown did agree that Jovanovich used excessive and unnecessary force but disagreed with the agency\u2019s recommendation to fire the officer. Instead, he suggested that Jovanovich be suspended for a year.\u00a0\u201cPO (Police Office) Jovanovich authored a report which grossly mischaracterized the interaction and contained false information. Both the brutality of his physical action and his attempt to falsely justify his actions in an official Department Report make him unfit to be a police officer,\u201d COPA said.\u00a0\u00a0COPA also recommended that two other officers involved in the incident, Sgt. Kevin Gleeson and Lt. Godfrey Cronin, be fired. Though neither officer committed excessive force, COPA said they participated in the \u201cdeliberate attempt to minimize\u201d what happened because they approved reports from Jovanovich that included false and misleading information.A third officer, Andres Valle, was accused of failing to report the excessive force Jovanovich used when he hit Boyd. COPA recommended a 60-day suspension.\u00a0Boyd is an abolitionist, so jail time wasn\u2019t the solution she desired. Instead, she wanted Jovanovich to participate in a series of restorative justice circles.Restorative justice circles are used outside of the criminal legal system to repair the harm caused by crime. Typically an individual meets with trained community members to discuss the impact their choice has had on the community and they work together to come up with a repair of harm agreement that the participant must complete.\u201cThat would have been a very powerful moment seeing that no cop in Chicago history has ever done so,\u201d Boyd told The TRiiBE this afternoon. However, she recognizes that it would not be a quick process and that it could take years.\u00a0\u201cA restorative justice process or a healing circle is not a one-and-done thing. You can\u2019t heal from something in a day. So I feel like that would have probably been a struggle for the officer to go through the accountability process of restorative justice circles,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not a one-time process, and it may have been frustrating and very different for him.\u201d\u00a0 Boyd is one of the plaintiffs listed in a class action lawsuit against the city and CPD. The suit includes many organizers and leaders in the movement for Black lives and alleges that the department responded to the city\u2019s summer of protests and demonstrations in 2020 \u201cwith brutal, violent, and unconstitutional tactics that are clearly intended to injure, silence, and intimidate,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\u00a0After the incident, Boyd recalled being in pain that night and said sleeping was challenging.\u00a0\u201cIt was very painful when it happened because, like that night, I couldn\u2019t sleep, and wind pressure affected the inside of my mouth. So that was like a very painful night. I couldn\u2019t sleep for like two days,\u201d she said.\u00a0She received free medical care from Smith and Smile Studio in Hyde Park and in Atlanta from Dr. Heavenly Kimes, a dentist and cast member of Bravo\u2019s reality television show \u201cMarried to Medicine.\u201dThough Boyd no longer experiences physical pain, she remembers the assault vividly. She experiences anxiety when she comes into contact with large groups of police officers.\n        Movement work is a matter of life and death for many protesters and organizers in Chicago.What happened to Boyd nearly two years ago also demonstrated that \u201cthe city of Chicago has no intention of protecting the lives of Black and brown women and youth,\u201d she said.For a moment after the assault, Boyd said she did consider temporarily taking a step back from organizing. However, while she received support from her community and strangers online, she was harassed by random people online and received threats on social media, primarily from Facebook users who blamed her for being assaulted by Jovanovich. For a moment, she deactivated her Facebook account.But taking a step back didn\u2019t last for long, Boyd said, because she knew she was being honest about what happened to her, and she realized it was necessary to keep going.\u00a0\u201cI know who I am and what I stand for, and the important work that I\u2019m doing in my community. I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s important here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are fighting to pass the Peacebook Ordinance on the city and state level. We want it funded directly from the CPD budget.\u201d\u00a0GKMC started organizing around the Peacebook Ordinance in 2020. The ordinance would invest in young people and provide the resources needed to create a culture of peace in Chicago communities that experience both police violence and inter-community harm.\u00a0The ordinance also calls for allocating two percent of CPD\u2019s budget to community-run services such as violence interruption, education, mental health programs, and more.GKMC and Chicago City Council members announced the ordinance\u2019s introduction in June 2022, but the ordinance was blocked from advancing that same day, according to WTTW News.\u00a0\u00a0The Peacebook Ordinance was initially assigned to the City Council Committee on Health and Human Relations, but according to Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), one of the Black alders sponsoring the ordinance, Ald. Derrick Curtis moved the ordinance to the Rules Committee, where legislation can sit for months without action.\u00a0"

  "title": "New web series \u2018FINESSE\u2019 finds beauty in the lives and intimacy of Black queer people in Chicago",
  "text": "\u201cAfter\u00a0two years of it being in production and post-production, we\u2019re releasing it online on YouTube in full. That\u2019s my gift to my people on [Juneteenth]. I\u2019m really excited,\u201d Martell told The TRiiBE on June 8. He wrote, directed and stars in the series. VAM Studio, is an award-winning Black and queer-owned production company and film collective founded by Martell and co-founded by Jordan Phelps. VAM produced the series. The production company pushes inclusivity and diverse narratives.\u201cFINESSE,\u201d Martell said, grew out of the desire to see something different on screen for Black people that didn\u2019t center on trauma or pain. Instead, through the show, he wanted to showcase Black people being their regular selves as they experience the ebbs and flows of life. As a result, each character on the show can let their hair down and be their whole selves.\u00a0The series also highlights the perspectives missing in the mainstream representation of Black queer people. For example, \u201cFINESSE\u201d depicts intimacy between two Black queer men, something that\u2019s often not seen on the screen outside of the television drama series \u201cNoah\u2019s Arc\u201d or the 2016 film Moonlight, Martell said.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen two Black queer men show intimacy,\u201d Martell said. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue.\u201d\u00a0\u201cFINESSE,\u201d two years in the making, also revolves around a question posed by his therapist: What does intimacy look like for you?\u00a0Martell didn\u2019t immediately know the answer to that, but that question inspired him to find the answer.\u00a0\u201cI had to start to think about all of the people in my life who have shown me intimacy. For me, that has shone strongest through my chosen family and the community of artists that have held me when times were bad,\u201d Martell said.\u00a0\u201cThe more I wrote about it, the more I was releasing all of these demons, which made the work feel more vulnerable in a way that I feel like no one has seen before in stories like this,\u201d he observed.So Martell put pen to paper, re-imagining the role of intimacy and its role in his life and the lives of the would-be 20-something-year-old characters on the show: Daryn (Jeez Loueez) Kizer (Jaren Merrell, a.k.a. Shea Coule\u00e9) and Martell (Vincent Martell) who are roommates and friends.\u00a0The trio\u2019s friendship exists on and off-screen. They\u2019ve been friends for over a decade, Martell said. On working with his real-life friends, he said, \u201cIt felt f\u2014 incredible. It was life-changing to grow with these people and to be able to tell a story about your life. It made me realize that we can create art with the people that we love and we can create art with our homies.\u201dThe series was shot in Martell\u2019s home in Humboldt Park. Originally from Toledo, Ohio, he came to Chicago with his family in 2001. They moved to the western suburbs in 2004 and settled back in Chicago in 2008. He relocated to Los Angeles in 2020.\u00a0Additionally, the series has a political, but catchy intro song that\u2019s in tune with Chicago\u2019s juke and footwork music, \u201cBeat Lori Lightfoot\u201d by \u00cbkoli.The TRiiBE caught up with Martell ahead of the Juneteenth web premiere of \u201cFINESSE\u201d and discussed the show\u2019s origin, the power of storytelling, the importance of intimacy outside of the traditional means, what it was like to shoot and produce a show with close friends and what\u2019s next for the series.\u00a0\u201cFINESSE\u201d will be available on Sunday, June 19, on Vam Studio\u2019s YouTube page at 8:00 AM central time.\u00a0(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity).The TRiiBE: So I was at an award ceremony back in May. I was taking a bathroom/selfie break when I unknowingly heard the series theme song, \u201cBeat Lori Lightfoot\u201d by \u00cbkoli,\u00a0 for the first time. Then I saw the screeners for the series and realized it was the same song. Was this song created for the show, or did it already exist?Vincent Martell: That song is from an amazing artist and producer, \u00cbkoli. I think it might have been around for a minute. But I knew as soon as I heard it that I had to incorporate it in this piece because it just felt specific to how I felt living in Chicago and dealing with [Mayor] Lori Lightfoot. The communities and the city that I love are being neglected.\u00a0 So it made sense to put that first in \u201cFINESSE\u201d because \u201cFINESSE\u201d is a statement. \u201cFINESSE,\u201d for me, is a political act. So that song matches the energy I was trying to get there.How would you describe \u201cFINESSE \u201d for people tuning in for the first time on Juneteenth?VM: \u00a0When I created \u201cFINESSE,\u201d I wanted to create something fun. I wanted a good-ass time for Black people. I was tired of watching TV where we\u2018re seen as either villainized or victims. I wanted something different. I wanted to give a story where we\u2019re celebrating ourselves, where we\u2019re smoking joints, talking shit about the mayor and watching Wendy Williams, and we\u2019re having intimacy in the truest forms.\u00a0I wanted to live in those moments. When I was going through these dark times, I wanted something to escape, and there was nothing I could relate to and get lost in. So me thinking, \u201csh\u2013 if this is happening to me, I know it\u2019s happening to many other people.\u201d I wanted \u201cFINESSE\u201d to be a sexual colorful roller coaster for Black people. It\u2019s showing the best of our humanity, and it\u2019s also showing us being messy and how that can be beautiful in its rawest form.\u00a0When I think of the word finesse, I think about how Black people use the word. The idea is, how can I do this to get this result? Does the series title come from that same idea?VM: Absolutely, it\u2019s that, but also, I think finesse is a lifestyle for me. Just thinking about my journey as an artist and business owner, I\u2019ve had to adopt this finesse lifestyle to be able to get ahead and bring resources to myself and my people in my community, to make sure that our work was getting seen in the mainstream, outside of Chicago and U.S., but across the world. It takes a lot of finesse to be able to do that and to be able to move in those spaces and to be able to create some sort of revolution and what\u2019s happening is, right now, you have Chicago artists who are naturally finessers, because we\u2019re from Chicago, a place where you have to finesse to survive, and the most corrupt city in the world, in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0We wanted to show that natural finesse that we have not just being from Chicago, but the Midwest, where you\u2019re slept on all the time, just because you\u2019re not on the East or the West coasts. But we grind harder, do the work, stay quiet and put our head down, but we finesse to make sure that we survive because Chicago is not an easy place. It\u2019s a beautiful place, but it\u2019s not an easy place. So \u201cFINESSE\u201d is that. It\u2019s that journey. It\u2019s the action. It\u2019s the lifestyle and the mindset.\u00a0But also, there\u2019s a bad side to finesse too. There\u2019s burnout, depression, and a lack of intimacy. There\u2019s the soul-finding process that can be messy and beautiful. So it\u2019s finesse in the way that we know. But it\u2019s also the lifestyle and the mindset of finesse for me.\u00a0When we started speaking, I asked you about the inspiration behind creating \u201cFINESSE,\u201d and you mentioned a conversation with your therapist where she asked what intimacy looks like for you? Is that what you hope people walk away with after viewing \u201cFINESSE\u201d that they answer that question themselves?\u00a0VM: I do. Because I want people to walk away and reflect on the intimacy in their lives, it doesn\u2019t have to be the traditional way of intimacy we see or we\u2019ve been told we need. It can come from friends, those close to you, or those in your community. That\u2019s what \u201cFINESSE\u201d is about. You see that intimacy is the strongest when they\u2019re on the couch, chilling with their homies, and that\u2019s something that I had to learn too. I don\u2019t need intimacy in a traditional way. I need intimacy in the community, friendship, and homie way, and seeing that with just us Black people not being victimized, not being targeted. It\u2019s just revolutionary in itself because we just see us living and having fun. That\u2019s the type of party I want to bring to TV.\n        The TRiiBE interviewed director Vincent Martell about his new web series, Damaged Goods, and the freedom of making work decentering whiteness.What has the experience been like for you being a filmmaker and creative here in Chicago?VM: It\u2019s been tough. I\u2019m now in LA because there weren\u2019t enough resources for me out there [in Chicago]. I had spent my entire 20s trying to create a community of filmmakers, of underrepresented artists and underground artists who weren\u2019t getting seen. That\u2019s what VAM Studio was, and I dedicated my entire life to that, and to make sure that underrepresented artists got time on screen and sets, got hours and got paid. But I didn\u2019t feel I could do all that I could because of what the city could provide. I felt as though sometimes Chicago only holds you up when you make it somewhere else, and unfortunately, I\u2019m now seeing that [with me] being out here in LA and killing it. So now, all of these resources and attention are coming.\u00a0It\u2019s sad that we have to leave our city to get the attention of our city. Whereas you know, this thing about being an inclusive set, a teaching set, making sure that women and femme Black people are on the forefront of the lines in the film, that\u2019s something that VAM has been doing for 10 years before Hollywood was even buzzing about it.\u00a0We created that system and culture, and we didn\u2019t get any credit for it. That\u2019s what happens in Chicago. Sometimes as a creator, you might get lost, sometimes forgotten, and that\u2019s tough.\u00a0That was heartbreaking for me. So what I learned, though, is if I\u2019m going to be about the art, I have to be about the art. I can\u2019t be about whether or not people know I\u2019m doing it; I have to be about the outcome. I got to be about making the opportunities and the sacrifices because I want to do it. That\u2019s the biggest thing I learned from being an artist in Chicago. If I\u2019m going to be about the socio-economic impact of the film industry, then I got to do the work. But it\u2019s okay if I don\u2019t get the credit all the time. I just got to be for it.\u00a0"

  "text": "On February 20, 2020, the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office (CCSO) shackled Shannon Ross\u2019s leg with an electronic monitoring device that tethered him to the confines of his home. Although he lived in northern Indiana, Ross was forced to move to Chicago as one of the conditions of being on CCSO\u2019s electronic monitoring (EM) program after he was arrested here in October 2019 on charges of theft of less than $500 and felony possession of a firearm. The move resulted in him losing his job as a forklift operator and losing his car after he was unable to make payments.Ross, 32, said his electronic monitor sent false alarms daily, each one alleging that he\u2019d left his home in Chicago\u2019s East Side neighborhood without approval. Within the first week of being on EM, Ross said one of the CCSO officers who came to his house tried to pressure him into saying he left his home to take out the garbage\u2014which would have been admitting to violating the terms of EM, since his garbage can is located outside. When he refused, a second CCSO officer advised Ross to record a video of himself in his room whenever he receives a false EM violation alarm.During the year and a half that Ross was on house arrest, from February 2020 through September 2021, he says that CCSO officers showed up to his home more than 20 times.On one visit, Ross said officers nearly arrested him despite the fact that he told them he had video evidence that he hadn\u2019t left his home. \u201cThey almost didn\u2019t want to see my proof,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them, like, \u2018I have proof.\u2019 And they really wasn\u2019t caring until my girl came out with the proof and [was] like, \u2018Look, he\u2019s not lying.\u2019 Some officers are just like that\u2014just don\u2019t care.\u201dDuring several of the officers\u2019 visits, Ross\u2019s kids were home, and they saw him get handcuffed and questioned about his whereabouts. \u201cThey treat you like you\u2019re a kid, like you\u2019re a criminal,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when you ask for a supervisor or their name, they don\u2019t give it to you\u2013so if I wanted to file a dispute, I can\u2019t. So I mean, they make it difficult.\u201dRoss had to get a judge\u2019s approval for any movement outside his home because he was placed on EM before February 2021, when Governor J.B. Pritzker signed the Pretrial Fairness Act\u2014which guaranteed movement for \u201cessential functions\u201d like getting groceries beginning in January of this year. Like many on EM, Ross was never granted movement outside his home even once, not even to buy food. His sister, a manager at Securitas, helped when she could, but work got in the way sometimes, he said.\u201cSo some days I\u2019ll go two days without eating,\u201d Ross said. \u201cSome days I go 24 hours with no food whatsoever.\u201d\u00a0After more than 18 months of being confined to his home with an ankle bracelet, he was found not guilty of the gun charge in September 2021. He was discharged from house arrest soon after.\u00a0He says since getting off EM, life has been better: during those 18 months, he saved money to take a marketing course and now runs his own marketing agency. But the trauma of being on EM affects him even today.\u201cI feel guilty every time I go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m not supposed to be there. So I be in the house a lot.\u201dToday, there are 3,000 people on electronic monitoring in Cook County. According to CCSO, the program is a \u201ccommunity-based alternative incarceration concept\u201d that allows those in pre-trial detention to remain at home rather than in jail.\u00a0The program has grown significantly since 2020 because courts were backlogged by the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing judges from hearing cases or approving pretrial movement for people on EM, and due to growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in jails.\u00a0According to a September 2021 report by Chicago Appleseed, the number of people on EM in Cook County declined in August of that year, but was still 31 percent higher than it was in March 2020. Seventy-eight percent of people in the program had been detained for at least three consecutive months.Consequently, hundreds of people still remain in ankle monitors today who still haven\u2019t been convicted of any crime. Individuals on EM could also face penalties in the future completely unrelated to their original charges. In January, Illinois state representative Martin J. Moylan, whose district includes suburban Elk Grove Village and Des Plaines, introduced a bill that would make knowingly tampering with, removing, or damaging electronic monitoring devices a Class 4 felony. In April, the bill was sent to the General Assembly\u2019s rules committee.When a person\u2019s EM device sends an alert, employees at an out-of-state call center review the alert to determine if it\u2019s genuine. Transparency Chicago, a nonprofit whose research includes CCSO\u2019s EM program, shared slides they obtained through FOIA that were presented to Cook County by University of Chicago\u2019s research lab, Radical Innovation for Social Change (RISC), which provides software and analysis to CCSO about the EM program.\u00a0According to the slides, more than 80 percent of the alerts sent by CCSO\u2019s EM vendor, Track Group, to CCSO and its call center are \u201cfalse positive\u201d alerts, each requiring manual review. RISC\u2019s slides state that these false positives threaten to distract CCSO and call center staff from more serious alerts.According to CCSO\u2019s contractor, information on how often the ankle monitors trigger an alert that results in a phone call or blaring siren cannot be collected. A spokesperson for Protocol, the third-party contractor that handles call center operations, said the company is unable to distinguish calls made to an EM device used by CCSO from calls made to people on house arrest outside of Cook County. In practice, that means nobody, anywhere, has an accurate picture of how often people on EM are called about alerts, false or otherwise.To understand how EM is impacting people placed in the program, we collected the experiences of those who were personally plagued with problems from CCSO\u2019s EM program and attorneys who shared their clients\u2019 experiences. Their experiences give insight into where the program\u2019s faults are, raising questions of why these life-destroying problems persist for so long and why it takes so long for officials to notice.The CCSO\u2019s call center is responsible for reviewing the many thousands of daily automated alerts that get triggered when their systems believe that a person violated the EM conditions\u2014for example, leaving their home. The call center has steps and procedures they follow, which range from noting the violation or calling the person on EM, to blaring a loud siren on their EM device or dispatching sheriffs to their home.\u00a0Documents obtained by The TRiiBE from CCSO via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request indicate that when the siren on a person\u2019s EM device goes off, the contractor\u2019s call center must check if the person on EM is in a courthouse. According to the Public Defender\u2019s office, there have been at least three instances of a person\u2019s monitor sounding an alarm while they\u2019re standing in front of a judge in the courthouse, one of which reportedly happened in front of a jury. A spokesperson for CCSO said they notified the EM contractor about these incidents, and said the contractor \u201cimplemented a programming that it believes will reduce or eliminate these events.\u201dWhen a person on EM is found to have significant signal issues within their home, one option CCSO provides in rare cases is what\u2019s commonly referred to as a \u201cbeacon.\u201d Because environmental issues such as building material can cause signal loss with GPS, the beacons are designed to mitigate signal loss entirely by being inside the person\u2019s home and only alerting if they move away from the beacon.About 13 percent of the 178 people who have had their monitor supplemented with a beacon have more than one beacon. According to emails between CCSO and the company that provides them, obtained by The TRiiBE through a FOIA request, a person on EM can have up to ten beacons.Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson, 27, has been on EM since August 2020. He is charged with hitting a helmeted police officer with a skateboard during a protest after police charged into a crowd of nonviolent demonstrators. Johnson has posted more than 150 videos on YouTube documenting the false EM alarms and violations he\u2019s received. On March 24, 2021, he received his first EM beacon, and a second one on April 15, 2021, after he moved to the South Side.\u00a0Yet Johnson\u2019s double beacons, one of which he said was installed incorrectly by CCSO, have caused a plethora of signal issues and a slew of accusations from call center employees and the sheriff.Notes related to Jeremy Johnson\u2019s ankle-monitor false alerts, which were obtained from the Cook County Sheriff via a FOIA request.In a video Johnson posted May 3, two CCSO officers criticized fellow officers for improper installation and spoke freely with Mohawk about the beacon\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\u201cWhen you hit a dead spot with your cell phone, it\u2019s still shitty at the end of the day. So that\u2019s the same thing with this thing [the beacon],\u201d one officer said on the video. \u201cIt sucks,\u201d shrugged the other officer as he uncuffed Johnson.In February 2021, Johnson received a call from the electronic monitoring agency almost nightly between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., accusing him of being outside of his apartment when he was in bed. Most of the late-night calls Johnson receives from call center employees end in them chalking the false alarms up to an automatic message or system glitch.\u00a0\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Johnson asked, \u201cwhy are you still putting it on people?\u201d \n        Jeremey \u2018Mohawk\u2019 Johnson documents his struggles with near-incessant false EM alerts.Another man we interviewed, Charles Bobock, shared his experiences with constant false EM violations and sheriff visitations. Most of these visitations begin with him being immediately handcuffed. Bobock says that during his time on EM, starting in July 2021, he was visited in his home by CCSO officers five or six times a month with accusations of leaving his home. Bobock says it wasn\u2019t until early 2022 that he began getting cuffed without explanation as soon as the front door was opened.\u00a0One week in April 2022, he was visited and cuffed four times. On April 11, he tweeted, \u201cLOL. Cuffed up behind my back again by CCSO. This time they had me walk down the street with everyone watching, so they could \u2018get a better signal\u2019 on my ankle monitor. That\u2019s twice in four days.\u201d\u00a0In May, Bobock endured a tumultuous period in which he was cuffed five times in eight days.\u201cEvery time they turn up, I panic, because as soon as those cuffs go on, I think these cuffs might not come off this time,\u201d Bobock said. \u201cI\u2019m useless for the rest of the day, because I\u2019m shaking after they leave. It\u2019s a real PTSD moment every time they put the cuffs on. I really don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m leaving with them or not. It gets to be really, really traumatic every time this happens.\u201dWe reached out to CCSO to ask why people on EM are handcuffed prior to questioning. In an emailed response, a spokesperson said it is to ensure the safety of investigators and others, and noted that CCSO policy states individuals should be restrained \u201conly for as long as reasonably necessary\u201d to ensure officer safety.According to Bobock, he has never been offered a beacon to help alleviate these false EM violations.\u00a0Bobock said that on May 24, sheriff\u2019s officers came to his home to arrest him, claiming that his home was unfit for the EM program. He added that his neighbor, who witnessed and intervened in CCSO\u2019s attempted arrest, invited Bobock to live in his home rather than be taken back to jail. After a discussion between the arriving officers and Bobock\u2019s neighbor, CCSO approved his move.After the attempted arrest, Bobock said he asked the officers why he was never given a beacon in spite of the constant visits for false alarms, and the officers responded that he hadn\u2019t hit the threshold needed to get one. When asked, a CCSO spokesperson did not clarify what that threshold might be.In an email to The TRiiBE, the spokesperson said \u201cenvironmental interference\u201d at Bobock\u2019s home \u201cmade it extremely difficult to comply with the court order and monitor his compliance with program rules,\u201d and that the \u201cnature of the site\u201d prevented installation of a beacon. Bobock said that the only thing he was told was that a garage is an unsuitable place to live.The TRiiBE interviewed\u00a0Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson over the phone on Nov. 19, 2020.\u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019ve ever been arrested,\u201d Jeremey \u201cMohawk\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt feels like they\u2019re trying to make an example out of me because they want to scare other protesters. And, in an environment where they\u2019re actively trying to scare you out of protesting, I would wager that a lot of protesters feel guilty for taking this rest.\u201dRead the full interview in our storyRegardless of whether Bobock\u2019s previous home was suitable or not for the EM program, with or without a beacon, one thing is clear\u2014before Bobock was able to move into his home, the CCSO officers who dropped him were required to run an \u201cInitial Residence Verification\u201d process, which should include livability checks and confirmation that the EM device was \u201cactivated\u201d with the EM vendor.\u00a0After living in his new home for over a week, Bobock says that things have been quiet, with the exception of one signal strength text, which was followed by a visit and handcuffing by the officers, stating, \u201cjust checking up on you.\u201d In spite of everything, Bobock says that he\u2019s able to move around his neighborhood with no complaints from CCSO.\u201cI\u2019ve been wandering around the block picking up trash, taking the dog to the dog park across the street each day, taking the garbage to the dumpster\u201d Bobock said. \u201cAll things that would have got me into trouble before.\u201dIn another case, a company changing its name led to one of its employees, who was on EM, being reincarcerated. Richard Bullock, a 40-year-old man facing first-degree murder charges, was sent back to jail after a CCSO investigator concluded that Bullock had forged pay stubs and proof of employment. The investigator apparently came to that conclusion while looking into Bullock\u2019s scheduled work movement, and found via the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s website that the company he worked for, Upskel Housing INC, had dissolved in 2019. The investigator seems to have failed to notice that the company had simply reincorporated under a new name, Upskel LLC, which was also listed on the website. According to Bullock\u2019s lawyer, the forgery allegations are unresolved, and the murder case is still pending.Another man, who shared his experience with us on the condition of anonymity due to fear of impact to his ongoing criminal case, wound up wearing two ankle monitors at once. The sheriff\u2019s office still hadn\u2019t removed his ankle device and continued to visit him at his home despite a court order that had discharged him from the sheriff\u2019s EM program a week earlier so that he could move to the more-lenient EM program managed by the chief judge. At the courthouse, a second EM device, meant to work with the chief judge\u2019s EM systems, was attached to his other leg, and he would have to be scheduled for the removal of CCSO\u2019s.\u00a0The night of his court appearance for his EM discharge, he received a 2:00 a.m. visit from the sheriff alleging that he violated EM after leaving the courthouse. The officers who went to his home were not aware that the discharge was filed. When we spoke with him, he\u2019d been wearing two devices for a week and was afraid to leave his home, from worries of another late-night visit or potential reincarceration.Tracey Harkins, an attorney whose clients include many on EM, shared her experiences with prosecutors whom she characterized as aggressive and judges who she says have impossible standards and deep misunderstandings of GPS accuracy.\u201cIt was common practice for judges to scoff at any attorney suggesting that technology failure could be at issue for resolution,\u201d Harkins said. In a case where CCSO admitted technology failure, she said the presiding judge responded in earnest, \u201cGPS is the most reliable thing in the world.\u201dThe Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO) relies on progress reports that show when a person on EM allegedly leaves their home to determine whether to increase their bond or reincarcerate those on EM. Harkins said that in her experience, a vast majority of judges read the reports at face value with no verification, testimony, or additional information. She said that attorneys who requested hearings to challenge progress reports \u201cwere frequently scoffed at, or held to an impossible standard\u201d where judges agree to a hearing on the spot and without any preparation.\u00a0\u201cBeing held to a hearing immediately was grossly unfair,\u201d she said.\u00a0Harkins said that since last October, she has seen 30-40 people ordered back into custody based on these progress reports. When asked what can be done to improve CCSO\u2019s EM program, Harkins said that the sheriff\u2019s office needs to \u201cproperly and fully\u201d investigate alleged violations before writing reports or taking actions.\u00a0\u201cThis requires that appropriate training be implemented\u2014something that is currently lacking,\u201d she said.After WTTW published an article in March detailing the false alarms and prosecutorial action taken by CCSAO against Michael Matthews, one of Harkins\u2019s clients, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office withdrew their petition against Matthews, saying that they did so in good faith after seeing video that proved he was home when they claimed he hadn\u2019t been.\u00a0But Harkins said that CCSAO had already had that video in December.\u00a0\u201cOne of two things is true,\u201d she said. \u201dEither they are utterly incompetent and didn\u2019t connect the dots for three months, or they knew that there was a problem and ignored it and prosecuted Michael [Matthews] in bad faith\u2014either option is unacceptable.\u201dSince the Pre-Trial Fairness Act went into effect, Sheriff Tom Dart has claimed that the law has resulted in dozens of people on EM who have been accused of violent offenses being automatically given time to move about freely and unmonitored\u2014an assertion the Public Defender\u2019s office disputed at the time.\u00a0\u201cThey rarely give the underlying data for those assertions, and so there\u2019s no way to check their work\u2014which is concerning, given that those numbers have been found to be suspect,\u201d said Sarah Staudt, a senior policy analyst and staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice. \u201cIf Sheriff Dart is going to make proclamations about people on EM, he needs to give the underlying numbers out too, so folks can decide for themselves whether they agree with his assertions.\u201d\u00a0Cook County public defender Sharone Mitchell, who took office in April 2021, said he believes that Dart and Mayor Lori Lightfoot are intentionally misunderstanding the program to stoke fear and shift blame for violence in the city.\n        Black youth share their struggles with two of the city\u2019s ills: policing and gun violence.\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve seen alerts when people are actually sitting at their home, abiding by the condition of their release,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe know that in some instances people are being thrown back into jail without a hearing; it\u2019s just the notification of a violation that causes a person to be detained.\u201dMitchell emphasized that those on EM have only been accused of a crime, and could have their case dismissed or be found not guilty at trial. \u201cThere are real consequences to both pretrial incarceration through jail, and pretrial incarceration through electronic monitoring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that both of those outcomes disrupt people\u2019s jobs, their education, and their family obligations.\u201d"

  "text": "Visit The TRiiBE Election Center to learn more about the upcoming 2023 Chicago municipal election. Click here to find your Chicago ward and police district.Early in fall 2022, my hopes and dreams of Mayor Lori Lightfoot being unseated, and becoming a \u201cone and done\u201d Chicago mayor, were a real possibility.As one of her first public supporters in 2019, I had no idea she would be this disagreeable and lead this city like a federal prosecutor \u2014 which was her previous job title.I also had no idea that she would become \u201cTurncoat Lori\u201d once in office. Bold follow-through is uncommon in American politics, but it is important in a city where she won more than 2,000 precincts in her run-off election against Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Campaign-trail Lightfoot presented some strong positions, but then reneged on those promises in office.Campaign-trail Lightfoot:\u00a0As a result of this contentious leadership, I believed Lightfoot was in jeopardy of being a one-term mayor \u2014 until Nov. 10, 2022, when U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia (D-IL) officially joined the crowded race for Chicago mayor.\u00a0Chuy entering the race literally opened the door for a Mayor Lightfoot reelection. Chuy entered the race as the only Mexican-American candidate, but also as a \u201cProgressive Democrat,\u201d much like Kam Buckner and Brandon Johnson who both announced their candidacies before Chuy. This will most certainly split the progressive Black vote and shine a light \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 on how unique Mayor Lighfoot is to the ballot.Brandon Johnson, currently a Cook County Board Commissioner, is someone everyone should be watching. Optics matter in politics and he checks all the boxes: family man, political and community organizing experience, backed by respected Black and brown progressives in the City Council and he even knocked off a major West Side politician \u2014 Richard Boykin, who currently works for Willie Wilson\u2019s 2023 mayoral campaign \u2014 to become commissioner in 2018.\u00a0On paper, Johnson looks pretty good; I just don\u2019t know if he has time for the city of Chicago to get to know him before Feb. 28, 2023. However, he\u2019s already raised more than $1 million for his campaign \u2014 raising money is always good optics.It\u2019s too early to call but I\u2019m predicting a few things that could happen in the 2023 Chicago mayoral race:"

  "text": "Chicago\u2019s 2023 municipal election season is now in full swing. A total of 345 people submitted their candidate nominating petitions by the Nov. 28 deadline, filing to run for coveted positions such as mayor, clerk, treasurer, alders and the newly-created Police District Councils.And just like the 2019 municipal election in Chicago, the 2023 mayoral race is crowded again. Ten candidates have filed to run against mayoral incumbent Lori E. Lightfoot, who is also seeking a second term. That brings the total number of mayoral candidates to 11.2023 mayoral candidates include local businessman Willie Wilson, who is entering the race for a second consecutive time; former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who is running for a second consecutive time; Illinois State Rep. Kam Buckner; Cook County Board Commissioner Brandon Johnson; Ald. Sophia King, stepping down from her role as 4th Ward alder; community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, who is also entering the race for a second consecutive time; Chicago police officer Frederick Collins; freelance counselor Johnny Logalbo; Ald. Roderick Sawyer, who is stepping down from his role as 6th Ward alder and is the son of former Chicago mayor Eugene Sawyer; and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, who is running for a second time.\u00a0Of those candidates, eight are Black. In the 2019 city election, six of the candidates were Black. Prior to Lightfoot\u2019s election, Chicago hadn\u2019t had a Black mayor in 30 years; Mayor Harold Washington died suddenly during his second term in 1987, and then-6th Ward alderman Eugene Sawyer was appointed to lead the city until his defeat by Richard M. Daley in the 1989 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had the Daleys and Rahm Emanuel in office for many years, and now that Lori Lightfoot was able to take office, I believe that we have Black leaders who feel like they have a chance or want to make a difference,\u201d said Ariane Hicks, a millennial hailing from Chatham.\u00a0Like with every election, there\u2019s so much at stake. How do Black Chicagoans feel about there being so many Black candidates in the 2023 mayoral race? How will Black Chicagoans navigate choosing the best candidate in an overcrowded field?\u00a0The question of whether or not there are too many Black candidates is based on a longtime question raised by Black Chicagoans about splitting the vote.\u00a0 According to Chicago political reporter Monroe Anderson, Washington won the mayoral race by bringing together a coalition of Black, Latine and progressive white voters. After Washington\u2019s untimely death, there was a split in the Black vote that led to Richard M. Daley winning the election in 1989 and maintaining power for nearly three decades.\u00a0To find answers to those questions, The TRiiBE spoke to Black residents and political strategists about the 2023 mayoral race.\u00a0Although opinions varied among different generations, all five of the people we spoke with agreed that whoever takes the reigns in 2023 will need to work to unite all Chicagoans, be business-oriented, have the best interest of Black Chicago at heart and be supportive of all communities; which includes investing in under-resourced Black and brown neighborhoods on the South and West Sides.\u201cWhat we should have done is we should have rallied around one candidate. It makes it easier for us [Black voters],\u201d said Sheila Owens, a Douglas resident and member of Generation X.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough political education made available to voters so that they can make informed choices for each race. She also believes some Black candidates could have dropped out of the race so that there would be one single candidate in the race.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m a little bewildered by all of these people that have jumped up and started campaigning,\u201d she added. \u201cI understand each of them has their own agenda, but it should be a common agenda because you\u2019re serving one city. So I\u2019m a little frustrated with that.\u201d\u00a0Owens pointed to Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th Ward). He initially planned to run for mayor but then withdrew from the race on Nov. 21, making way for Chicago\u2019s Latine community to throw all their support behind Garcia should they choose to do so.\u00a0Instead, Lopez will seek a third term in the Chicago City Council.\u201cYou don\u2019t see multiple Latino candidates in the race,\u201d Chicago based-Democratic strategist Ron Holmes said. \u201cOur community is the one that will be divided heading into at least the runoff. And that is an interesting proposition for those looking to build Black power across the board.\u201dChicago voters can vote by mail beginning on Jan. 19 and early voting begins on Jan. 30. If no mayoral candidate gets 50 percent of the vote on Chicago\u2019s election day (Feb. 28, 2023), then the top two candidates will face one another in a run-off in April 2023.\u00a0The new term for mayor begins on May 15, 2023.\u00a0Holmes said the current crop of Black candidates is a bit more talented than we saw in the 2019 Chicago mayoral election. Most of the 2023 candidates \u2014 including Lightfoot, Buckner, King, Sawyer and Johnson \u2014\u00a0 are currently serving as elected officials and have legislative records that voters can examine to make an informed decision on election day.\u00a0There are also new faces like Johnson, for example, who has scored major endorsements from progressive organizations and labor unions such as the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and SEIU Local 73.\n        Career politicians are stepping down, and there\u2019s now an opportunity for new \u2014 and possibly progressive \u2014 Black leaders to take the reigns.A sea of fresh faces in all the 2023 municipal races is exciting for some Black Chicago voters. So far, 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting. I think it speaks to the general demographic of Chicago\u2014 that Black people want to be represented in our government. We want to be the voice on a higher scale for our people because only we truly know what our people need,\u201d said Aliyah, who resides in Rogers Park and is a member of Generation Z. (Reporter\u2019s note: Aliyah asked The TRiiBE, not to include her last name in the article).\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d Samantha Grant said about there being eight Black candidates for mayor. She is a millennial who lives in the Tri-Taylor neighborhood. \u201cIt means people think they have a good shot of winning,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s how democracy works.\u201dOwens raised concerns about whether there\u2019s enough time between now and the Feb. 28, 2023, municipal election for candidates to speak directly to voters across Chicago communities.\u00a0She fondly recalled former mayor Washington\u2019s grassroots campaign in the 1980s. She called it inclusive, referencing how Washington was able to create a Black and brown led coalition.With today\u2019s mayoral candidates, Owens says there\u2019s a lack of outreach from them and their campaign teams. This could make it difficult for voters to make an informed choice if candidates aren\u2019t dedicating enough time to engage with them before February. Holmes echoed her sentiments.\u201cFolks aren\u2019t going to necessarily be able to interact with candidates in a meaningful way. You\u2019re not going to get a bunch of candidates knocking on your door. So you\u2019re basically going to get one or two sentences about a candidate, if you\u2019re lucky, in a news story,\u201d Holmes explained.\u00a0Holmes added that Black candidates with an abundance of campaign dollars are more likely able to communicate their message to the masses through creative means. Other candidates, with less financial backing, have more limited options.\u201cYou might get a robocall and see some yard sides, but you\u2019re not going to be able to drill down to see what they believe, from a policy perspective, even the most highly informed voters,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0\u00a0What are Black Chicagoans looking for in a mayoral candidate?When considering the best candidate for mayor, political strategist Larry Luster said to examine who has the ability to properly manage the city.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything from trash being picked up to clean water. Does your toilet flush? Is your electricity on?\u201d he explained.\u00a0Luster, a partner at the Springfield-based Black lobbying firm GR Consulting, has worked on political issues across state, local and county federal governments, and campaigns for elected leaders, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cTo take it a step further, that includes managing crime [and] managing business development. Have those things been moving forward? Those are things that I think voters will look at as they make their decisions,\u201d he added.\u00a0Jason Campbell, a millennial living in Washington Park, is looking for a candidate with a record of leading and making tough decisions. He believes Lightfoot has done a good job at managing crises throughout her first term.\u00a0\u201cAt the end of the day, I think Lori has done a really good job of being an executive and surrounding herself with people that can do the work. At the end of the day, she\u2019s pretty functional with what she\u2019s done,\u201d Campbell said.\u00a0Most of the people that The TRiiBE spoke with weren\u2019t familiar with each of the 2023 mayoral candidates. Some knew about Wilson because of his numerous gas and grocery giveaways throughout 2022 and during his 2019 campaign.\u00a0Holmes said candidates like Johnson, King, Sawyer and Buckner have a significant hill to climb to gain more recognition citywide. For example, South Side residents may know King because she\u2019s an alder on that side of the city, but residents on other sides of the city may not be familiar with her."

  "text": "Population: 53,526Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0On Jan. 25, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Emma Mitts (37th Ward) and other elected officials gathered in West Humboldt Park for a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a police and fire academy that was built despite protests from some community members.\u00a0\u201cI think this is a win for the United States of America since this is the first joint public safety academy in the United States,\u201d Mitts said during the press conference.\u00a0The training facility was five years in the making. In 2019, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s proposal for the multi-million project because they said further investments in police would mean more state-sanctioned violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, through their grassroots campaign, they demanded that the City fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0Despite the protests, the City Council voted 38 to 8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019 (5th Ward Ald. Leslie Hairston was the only member of the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus\u00a0 who voted against it at the time). Last September, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the total cost to $128 million.\u00a0The facility includes a \u201ctactical scenario village\u201d for police and fire training and a six-story tower, with each floor simulating different environments firefighters encounter.\u00a0The facility sits on a 30.4-acre former rail yard that sat vacant for more than 40 years before the City purchased it in 2017. The site will also include two restaurants and 27,000-square-foot Boys and Girls Club, which will open this summer.\u00a0Mitts faces three challengers in the 37th Ward aldermanic race: Corey Dennelle Braddock, Jake Towers and Howard Ray. She was first appointed to the seat in 2000 by then-Mayor Richard M. Daley. Her predecessor, Percy Giles, was convicted of taking a bribe and sentenced to just over three years in prison in 1999.\u00a0During her tenure, Mitts opened the city\u2019s first Walmart, the ward\u2019s first public library branch, and most recently, the police and fire academy. A not-yet-open but completed Amazon warehouse is also situated in the 37th Ward. There\u2019s also a brand-new youth sports and community center, the North Austin Community Center, that opened its doors on Feb. 2.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed two people who live in the 37th Ward. Both residents spoke with pride about the community within their different blocks in Austin. They also expressed passion for the ward\u2019s future and discussed various improvements that could help the 37th Ward, which has experienced decades of disinvestment. Reporter\u2019s note: The TRiiBE interviewed Stamps following a West Side rally for Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson at the Healing Temple Church Banquet Hall in Austin).\u00a0Neighborhood you live in: AustinOccupation: Teacher Assistant at the Chicago Board of EducationHomeowner or renter?

I mean, it\u2019s not the best. It\u2019s not the worst. Most of the homeowners on my block are seniors because they\u2019ve been there for over 30 to 40 years. There are a few newcomers. Some have moved out to other areas, but most people on my block are seniors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0Where do Black people gather and socialize in the 37th Ward? \u201cThat\u2019s a good question. I think people are indoors. You don\u2019t see people hanging out. It\u2019s not just happening in the 37th Ward. I think Chicago is deserted now due to COVID and the crime rates. People are scared to come out. Kids don\u2019t come out and play as much because there are drive-bys. This is happening all over. It\u2019s not just in the 37th Ward. The West Side Health Authority is on my block on Division. Young folks like to go there. I noticed a lot of them coming around the neighborhood and passing out flyers for different types of events going on. They\u2019re trying to get the young folks to get involved. But it\u2019s kind of hard, though.\u201d\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYeah, we\u2019re going to vote right now for early voting.

I don\u2019t support the business because of the labor agreements, but as far as bringing resources to the neighborhood, it was a good thing. But as far as them not employing union people, that\u2019s my issue.\u201dWhat do you like about living in the 37th Ward?\u00a0"

  "text": "Incumbent: Ald. Chris Taliaferro Headed to runoffContesting candidates:Population: 53,635Demographics:Neighborhoods included:Median household income:Top issues, according to people we interviewed:Landmarks:\u00a0Austin was once a bustling community area that boasted more than 120,000 middle-class residents at its peak in 1930. There were street railways to downtown every half mile, and booming businesses on Madison Street, Lake Street and Chicago Avenue.\u00a0However, there\u2019s been a tremendous population loss since then. Today, there are just a little over 53,000 residents in Austin, and most of them are Black. And those bustling business corridors are now vacant lots, dilapidated storefronts and crumbling facades after experiencing decades of divestment.In the 29th ward, incumbent Chris Taliaferro is focused on retaining his aldermanic power after a fleeting run for Cook County Judge in 2021. Contesting candidates CB Johnson, who last ran in 1999, Walter Adamcyzk, a republican, and Corey Dooley, who is facing allegations that he is not a registered voter in the ward, have a hard-won battle ahead.For our West Side wards profile series, The TRiiBE interviewed three Black women who reside in Austin and in Galewood, a small bungalow enclave within the community. Together, they painted an eclectic portrait of a neighborhood that once had rich communal ties but is now lacking affordable housing, political power, amenities such as grocery stores that are abundant in neighboring towns like Oak Park. Neighborhood you live in: GalewoodOccupation: RetiredHomeowner or renter? Homeowner in Galewood for 13 years, and owns another property in Humboldt Park.Do you feel safe? \u201cNowhere is safe in this area. That\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d\u00a0Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cI guess so. I read about him in a paper or something. He\u2019s never come to this block [Newcastle Avenue]. People on this block don\u2019t know who he is. Most of them. And I\u2019ve only seen him at meetings. He\u2019s never ever in the neighborhood.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him in person [outside of a political setting] and the one time I reached out to him via email, he responded he would get to repaving our street and alley [in his] next term . . . .Is he really the alderman? Are we in the 29th Ward?\u201d\u00a0What do you like about your ward? \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s nothing to write home about like it was 20 years ago. Because, one thing is, it was like six Blacks on this block when we moved here. Now it\u2019s many more Blacks from Austin that\u2019s on this block now.\u201d\u00a0What do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0How do you get your news? \u201cNextdoor app.\u201d She also used to get a lot of her news from Ald.\u00a0 Nicholas Sposato\u2019s newsletter when she lived in Humboldt Park.What do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0More police patrols: \u201cI\u2019ve been here about 13 years and I guess I\u2019ve seen a police car drive through here five times.\u201dNeighborhood you live in: GalewoodOccupation: Retail Store Manager\u00a0Homeowner or renter? Homeowner. Also owns another home in the same neighborhood.Do you feel safe? \u201cYes\u201d.Do you know who your alderperson is? \u201cMmhmm. I know he was trying to run for judge but I don\u2019t really know anything [else about him] actually.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him out, only when he was knocking on my door [while campaigning].\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cI\u2019ve owned another house down the street, so 20 years I\u2019ve lived over here. The neighborhood is a quiet neighborhood. Finally, some friendly neighbors.\u201dWhat do you dislike about your ward?\u00a0Do you feel like your neighborhood is communal? \u201cNo, not really. I think on my block it\u2019s more communal, but I think outside of the block, I don\u2019t think people know each other. A lot of blocks have block club parties. We\u2019ve never had one, at least since I\u2019ve been here.\u201dDo you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? I definitely will be up there to vote, as usual. I just voted in this last election. So I definitely plan on voting.\u201dHow do you get your news about the election? \u201cI know Lightfoot\u2019s the current mayor but I don\u2019t know who\u2019s running. I only watch TV. I\u2019ve gotten text messages from different offices.\u201dWhat do you wish your alderperson would do to improve your ward?\u00a0\u00a0Neighborhood you live in: AustinOccupation: Associate Political Director for United Working Families.

I\u2019m a little upset at the idea that I can\u2019t afford the houses in the neighborhood that raised me.\u201d\u00a0Do you feel safe? \u201cI absolutely feel safe in all parts of Austin.\u201dDo you know who your alderperson is? \u201cYes, I do. Chris Taliaferro.\u201dWhat do you know about your alderperson? \u201cI know him through family relationships. My mother was an avid supporter of his during his first campaign [for alderperson in 2015]. So I am familiar with him on a more personal level. Now, politically? I am not as keen as I would like to be on his platform. The one thing that I do recall him being open and willing to engage in the conversation was around the Anjanette Young ordinance. He participated in the conversation, but it didn\u2019t pass. I sat on the Concerned Women of Illinois Committee of Rainbow PUSH. And we had a forum where he was open to answering questions from not just the West Side, but the statewide coalition of women, regarding the Anjanette Young ordinance.\u201dWhat do you like about your ward? \u201cThe West Side is the best side. It\u2019s the rich history and culture, and the families. I\u2019ve lived in Austin for 37 years. There\u2019s so many other families that have remained in the neighborhood and have survived the concerted efforts of disinvestment. I think that the resiliency and pride of the residents is part of the beauty of Austin. And, I mean, Austin does have some really beautiful homes, and Columbus Park is a very beautiful feature of the community as well.\u201dWhat do you dislike?\u00a0Do you plan to vote in the 2023 Chicago municipal election? \u201cYes. My parents were politicians so I absolutely do vote. I gotta vote. It\u2019s like brushing my teeth. I truly believe that our power, our voice is in our vote. It hits different now.\u201d"

  "title": "Opinion: After another police killing in Chicago, we need to focus on care, not cops",
  "text": "When police take a life, a public-relations machine whirrs into motion. The goal of the subsequent press releases and media interviews is to cast whomever has been killed by a police bullet, car, or baton in an unsympathetic light. She may have been using drugs. He had an aggressive face. She was experiencing a mental health crisis. He had a gun. He ran. He had been arrested before. He was in a gang. Such well-worn lines serve a purpose: to keep the public from seeing the person and their family as victims deserving of rights, care, or mourning.We faced this machine again last week when Chicago police killed 21-year-old Isidro Valverde. One of us was his alderperson in Chicago\u2019s 33rd Ward and released a statement within hours of his death. In it, as we tried to confirm who had been shot and connect with the family in order to provide support, Valverde was referred to as a \u201cvictim\u201d of a shooting.\u00a0The backlash was swift. Police-adjacent actors launched a smear campaign against one of us\u2014an alderperson, now up for reelection, who has advocated for reallocating excessive police funding to building community-based care systems. Valverde was no victim, they insisted. Police seemed unable to tolerate the idea that he be mourned or that his family be provided support. After all, Valverde had shot at officers, they said, implying he deserved to die. As sad as this tired performance of self-righteous disregard for human life already was, there was something even more disturbing behind it.On February 7, Valverde went to a neighborhood bar near his home in the Irving Park neighborhood. He reportedly became intoxicated and stepped outside, where he got into a heated exchange. The security guard at the bar overheard and went to ensure everyone\u2019s safety. Valverde pulled out a gun and pointed it at the security guard, who deescalated the situation. Valverde put his gun away and agreed to walk away. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it ended,\u201d the security guard told a reporter. This is how all such situations would ideally conclude\u2013\u2013with a community keeping itself safe through violence interruption and mediation.But a short time later, police arrived, responding to a call that a man had threatened bar patrons. Valverde was still nearby, and someone pointed him out to the police. Valverde, who had been arrested three times before for charges associated with drugs and fleeing from officers, took off running. The police gave chase. Valverde tripped in an alley. The officers shouted at him to stay down. When he began to try to get up, they shot him multiple times, killing him as he lay on the ground.The police chief claimed Isidro had shot at the two officers chasing him and that they had then returned fire, killing him in self-defense. In a press conference held hours after the shooting, Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown stated that they had reviewed the body-cam footage and determined unequivocally that Valverde had shot at the officers.\u00a0This, it seems, was a lie. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which is responsible for investigating shootings involving police, independently reviewed the footage and found no evidence to corroborate Superintendent Brown\u2019s account. Furthermore, the police decision to run after Valverde appears to violate Chicago\u2019s no-chase law that went into effect last year after a series of avoidable, police-instigated violent encounters, such as the killings of 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 22-year-old Anthony Alvarez. This law prohibits officers from chasing after people simply because they\u2019ve run away or allegedly committed minor offenses. It was designed to prevent needless violence\u2013\u2013like Valverde\u2019s pointless, unnecessary death.It is well established that US police, including Chicago\u2019s during Superintendent Brown\u2019s tenure, sometimes falsify reports and disseminate misinformation after injuring or killing people in attempts to justify their actions and evade scrutiny. It has also been widely suspected that mayors, who oversee police departments and are eager to avoid negative media attention that might harm their personal careers, will participate in strategically distorting, delaying, and burying the truth. We are both advocates for non-police community safety systems and have long decried the harm inflicted on our communities when reactive police and incarceration systems are relied upon as substitutes for preventive support systems. After years of work in this arena, we would not be surprised if Superintendent Brown deliberately lied about Valverde\u2019s death. We are, after all, in the middle of a heated local election season in which police funding and accountability are major subjects of debate. Furthermore, the incumbent mayor upon whom Brown\u2019s career and legacy depends is falling behind in the polls.Superintendent Brown and anyone else\u2013\u2013including Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who has previously been accused of participating in cover-ups of police killings and misconduct\u2013\u2013who is found to have been involved in misleading the public about Valverde\u2019s death should be held accountable. This is not the first time that Superintendent Brown has given what appear to be misleading statements about police violence and it\u2019s particularly egregious that he continues to do so in the context of a consent decree that continues to lag far behind in its implementation.\u00a0This decree was issued after the United States Department of Justice concluded a year-long civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department following the murder of Laquan Macdonald by a police officer in 2014. It mandates via court order that the CPD complete a series of reforms to confront over 50 years of repeated failures to act lawfully and to treat Chicago residents\u2013\u2013regardless of race or class\u2013\u2013equally under the law. To date, the CPD under Superintendent Brown and Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s supervision has repeatedly failed to meet the deadlines for reform stipulated by the decree, which, as a result, has been extended by an additional three years. This slow rate of change has persisted despite a ballooning Chicago police budget, which now exceeds $1.94 billion per year.\u00a0In this context, we have been joined by colleagues in an open letter calling for Superintendent Brown\u2019s resignation. But while we believe he is unfit to lead CPD, his departure alone will do little to reverse the rippling effects of Valverde\u2019s death. By opposing our efforts to care for Valverde\u2019s family in the immediate wake of his killing and by intimidating community members into withholding support, the police machine under Brown didn\u2019t just kill Valverde. It followed up to inflict yet further trauma upon his family, friends, and neighborhood by rushing to discredit Valverde, isolate his family, and divide rather than unite his community.When the police take the life of one of our neighbors, the consequences reverberate throughout communities and across generations. It tears open old wounds for many of us who have lost loved ones to gun violence, had family members abused or intimidated by police, or who struggle to trust our own communities because of the lack of safety that decades of failed police-centric safety policies have left us.\u00a0This is why it is so important to be able to respond to traumatic events like Valverde\u2019s death\u2013\u2013which joins thousands of recent police shootings\u2013\u2013by coming together as a community to mourn, support those most affected, and begin the process of collective repair and organizing for the policy changes we need to build stronger, safer communities. Without that, experiences of loss at the hands of police perpetuate cycles of injury, distrust, poverty, despair, anger, and violence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Police reforms are overdue, but they cannot heal the harm that police violence has wrought on the families and communities who have suffered from it. To heal our communities, we need to invest in building systems for shared safety based in supportive care that builds trust rather than encourage retribution\u2013\u2013that is, non-police safety systems like the community health and justice worker corps one of us outlined in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.Safe communities are not those that are most policed but rather places where our government treats each resident\u2013\u2013and residents, in turn, treat one another\u2013\u2013with compassion and care enabled by public infrastructures designed to protect everyone rather than just the privileged few. As Chicago prepares to elect its alders and next mayor, we should be asking how they plan to protect our communities\u2013\u2013including when that requires standing up to police."

  "text": "On a snowy Jan. 26 evening, more than 100 people packed into the historic New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in West Garfield Park for a 2023 Chicago mayoral candidate forum, organized by the People\u2019s Unity Platform and hosted by the Grassroots Collaborative.The People\u2019s Unity Platform is a multi-racial coalition of neighborhood community organizations and labor unions that have worked on issues such as violence prevention, public health and safety, housing, public education, environmental quality, community safety and worker\u2019s rights. Some groups under the platform\u2019s umbrella are GoodKids MadCity, Chicago Torture Justice Center, Defund CPD, the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), the Jewish Council on Urban Affairs, Treatment Not Trauma and Grassroots Collaborative, to name a few.\u00a0Rev. Marshall Hatch, pastor of New Mount Pilgrim, spoke with pride about the West Side\u2019s involvement in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements in his welcoming speech.\u201cThis is the same community Al Raby organized [in] when he organized the Triple-C [Coordinating Council of Community Organizations] and invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Chicago in 1966. You can\u2019t get more grassroots than West Garfield Park,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cThis is also the same West Side, the same streets, where our hero and brother [Black Panther] Chairman Fred Hampton organized and was a visionary.\u201dThe energy in the sanctuary was infectious. Music blared from the church\u2019s speakers, including songs such as \u201cAin\u2019t No Stoppin\u2019 Us Now\u201d by McFadden & Whitehead. Attendees, many of whom were supporters of mayoral candidate Brandon Johnson, chanted \u201cwe\u2019re fed up,\u201d and \u201cwe want Brandon\u201d before the forum began.Event organizers provided childcare, masks and water bottles to ensure attendees were cared for while there; this is a unity practice seen at many Black, brown and queer-led movement actions.\u201cWe need more from our leaders. We need leaders to collaborate with us as officials. We need leaders to boldly stand with us. And we need leaders to keep their covenant with our communities,\u201d Grassroots Collaborative executive director Carlos Fernandez said while introducing the forum.Among the mayoral candidates in attendance were Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, State Rep. Kam Buckner, Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and community activist Ja\u2019Mal Green.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Sophia King (4th Ward), businessman Willie Wilson and U.S. Rep. Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) did not attend the forum.Rousemary Vega, a parent organizer with Raise Your Hand who co-chaired the forum, said Garc\u00eda\u2019s absence \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about him.\u00a0\u201cHe ignored the people. He ignored the people\u2019s cause and did what every other candidate has done, and that is ignore the West Side,\u201d Vega said. \u201cChuy not being here is not a surprise to me. Chuy not being here tells me exactly who Chuy is.\u201dGarc\u00eda initially confirmed his attendance for the event, but later backed out, according to forum co-chair and GoodKids MadCity youth organizer Miracle Boyd.\u201cI was disappointed, but I\u2019m not a big fan of Chuy. So I can\u2019t necessarily say I expected him to be there,\u201d she told The TRiiBE.\u00a0Judging by the praise Johnson received in the church that evening, it became more clear that he was the crowd favorite. Although Garc\u00eda has long been heralded as a Black and brown coalition builder and progressive leader by his peers, he is now making political decisions that conflict with the same progressive movement that he championed earlier in his career, according to many of Chicago\u2019s Black and brown leaders interviewed for this story.Those decisions, they say, have led to Garc\u00eda aligning with white political power; which, in multiple cases, has proven to be harmful to everyday working Chicagoans, particularly Black and brown residents.\u201cYou can look to the progressive movement and who they are supporting, and the lack of support that Chuy has from these organizations,\u201d said Ugo Okere, who chairs the 25th Ward IPO, an anti-capitalist organization that centers its work on housing, education, and environmental and economic justice issues. The group endorsed Johnson for mayor.\u201cAll of these organizations that we consider the progressive movement are supporting Brandon Johnson for mayor because, at the end of the day, one of the aspects of being a progressive elected is moving with the movement,\u201d Okere continued. \u201cChuy\u2019s lack of support from the movement shows that he doesn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe TRiiBE has asked Garcia\u2019s campaign for interviews multiple times since his Jan. 13 City Club speech where he unveiled his public safety plan, but to no avail. On Feb. 5, in response to emailed questions about his absence from the forum, his call for fully funding the Chicago Police Department in his public safety plan, and his role in helping to elect former mayor Harold Washington in 1983, Garc\u00eda\u2019s spokesperson Antoine Givens wrote:\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that anyone would question Congressman Garc\u00eda\u2019s progressive credentials: from co-founding Chicago\u2019s first independent political progressive organization alongside Rudy Lozano and a Brown, Black, and Caucasian coalition, to leading a hunger strike for a new school serving predominantly Latino and Black students in Little Village and North Lawndale \u2013\u00a0 that Paul Vallas opposed, to working in Congress on progressive legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act \u2013 he has been consistent over 40 years. He\u2019s written bills into law that fund carbon monoxide detectors in public housing and protect working people from predatory payday lenders.\u201d\u00a0The statement continued, \u201cThe Congressman is the only candidate in this race that has put forth a full public safety plan that addresses the immediate safety concerns of people while calling for increased community investment and the expansion of civilian crisis response teams. And is the only candidate that has a Women\u2019s Policy platform elevating the need to address maternal mortality rates for Black and Brown people who can become pregnant and a LGBTQ+ policy platform that highlights the need to support and expand the Hire Trans Now program.\u201dAfter months of speculation, Garc\u00eda announced his bid for the 2023 Chicago mayoral race on Nov. 10, the 40th anniversary of Harold Washington\u2019s 1983 announcement to run. Throughout his campaign, Garc\u00eda has evoked Washington\u2019s name at mayoral forums and debates. After a forum at Trinity United Church of Christ in January, Garc\u00eda wrote in a Twitter post, \u201cit\u2019ll take a coalition like the one we created with Harold Washington to build a city we\u2019re proud of.\u201d\u00a0However, some have taken offense to Garc\u00eda consistently bringing up Washington\u2019s name.\u00a0\u201cHe keeps using his relationship with Harold Washington as leverage to win Black and brown votes when that was over 20 years ago,\u201d Boyd said. \n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.Pastor Rich Redmond, a former publicist and aide to Washington, said Garc\u00eda referencing Washington\u2019s rainbow coalition is a strategy to win Black votes.\u201cThe Black community needs to stop allowing themselves to be tricked. They need to stop falling for personality instead of substance. We\u2019re throwing our vote away when we do that, and then we suffer later because we don\u2019t have people in there that understand our plight,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda and his peers routinely point to his efforts in coalition building as an example of his progressivism. As a student at University of Illinois-Chicago, Garc\u00eda fought for workers\u2019 rights and inclusive city services. In 1977, Garc\u00eda was part of a group of students who took over the chancellor\u2019s office, according to the Reader, which resulted in UIC opening the Latin American Cultural Center later that year. That same year, he met fellow UIC student and labor activist\u00a0 Rudy Lozano and worked alongside him to organize factory workers in Pilsen and Little Village, pushing for unconditional amnesty for undocumented immigrants.Soon, Lozano, Garc\u00eda and other organizers in Little Village began building political power for the 22nd Ward. With Garc\u00eda as his campaign manager, Lozano entered the 1983 aldermanic race with his eyes set on unseating incumbent Ald. Frank Stembark, a Democrat that was aligned with the \u201cVrdolyak 29,\u201d an all-white Chicago City Council majority bloc led by then-Ald. Edward \u201cFast Eddie\u201d Vrdolyak (10th Ward).\u00a0\u00a0According to U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.), Lozano and Garc\u00eda were independent of the city\u2019s white Democratic machine, and were trying to develop a group to challenge it.\u201cThey became supporters of Harold Washington, and this was the movement of Mexican and Puerto Rican Americans on the other side of town,\u201d Davis said.\u00a0During the late 1970s and early 1980s, with Davis living in North Lawndale and Garc\u00eda in Little Village, they hosted and attended community meetings to bridge the gap between Black and Latine activists in Chicago. Lozano helped build Black and brown unity by telling people in his community about Washington\u2019s campaign and registering voters. According to the Chicago Reader, Lozano and Garc\u00eda would ensure their staffers also passed out literature for Washington\u2019s campaign.\u201cSo they became a part of the effort that some of us forged together to try and get Harold Washington elected mayor of Chicago,\u201d Davis continued.The 1983 Chicago municipal election saw the highest voter turnout in history, according to Robert Vargas\u2019 \u201cWounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio.\u201d Washington won the election over his Republican opponent Bernard Epton, who many white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for in a campaign marred by open, vehement racism.\u00a0\u201cThe Latino vote was essential to Washington\u2019s victory; he captured 82 percent of Latinos. If that number would have been four percent less, he would have lost,\u201d Vargas wrote.With encouragement from campaign supporters and help from Washington, Garc\u00eda won his 22nd Ward alderperson seat in a 1986 special election mandated by a federal court order that redrew ward boundaries to give accurate representation to Black and Latino residents. Garc\u00eda was a decisive vote for Washington\u2019s administration in the divisive City Council following the infamous City Council wars. According to Vargas, Garc\u00eda would also help pass other initiatives during the Washington administration, such as the tenant bill of rights and a gang violence prevention program.\u00a0\u201cIt was so important because there was unity. Harold passed the first ethics legislation ever in Chicago of any significance. Chuy was right there,\u201d former 49th Ward alderperson and former Cook County clerk David Orr told The TRiiBE.\n        A white split is what put Harold Washington in the mayor\u2019s seat in 1983. After his death, the Black split was going to put \u2013 and keep \u2013 a white man in the mayor\u2019s office.Two months after Lozano lost the 1983 aldermanic race, he was murdered in his home. There was widespread speculation that Lozano was assassinated because of his work to build Black and brown solidarity and collective power.According to Redmond, Washington felt responsible for Lozano\u2019s death because they worked closely together. To honor him, Redmond said Washington did three things for Garc\u00eda: gave him a city job as deputy water commissioner (a role Washington intended for Lozano), backed Garc\u00eda\u2019s 1984 campaign for Democratic ward committeeman in the 22nd Ward, and supported his successful 1986 run for 22nd Ward alderperson.\u201cRudy and Harold had a relationship. Harold didn\u2019t have a relationship with Chuy; it was simply by association,\u201d Redmond told The TRiiBE.Garc\u00eda ran for Chicago mayor for the first time in 2015. Beloved former CTU president Karen Lewis recruited Garc\u00eda to challenge incumbent Mayor Emanuel after she decided not to run due to illness.By this point, Garc\u00eda had become the first Mexican-American ever elected to the Illinois state Senate in 1993, founded the nonprofit Little Village Community Development Corp (now known as Enlace Chicago), supported a 19-day hunger strike in 2000 that forced CPS build a new high school in Little Village, and in 2011 used his position as a Cook County Commissioner (4th District) to help enact a measure that made Cook County the first local government to end compliance with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests.Ald. David Moore (17th Ward) told The TRiiBE that it wasn\u2019t just Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career that made him a viable candidate to get behind in 2015. At the time, everyone\u2019s thought was, \u201canybody but Rahm.\u201dAlong with the CTU and other labor unions, many in the Black community supported Garc\u00eda in the 2015 election because of his history working with Black leadership such as Washington during his time in the City Council and with Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle while Garc\u00eda was a county commissioner, according to Delmarie Cobb, a veteran media and political consultant.Cobb said Garc\u00eda\u2019s connections to Lewis, Washington and Preckwinkle led Black people to trust him, adding that they also believed he would be a better mayor than Emanuel. Garc\u00eda forced Emanuel into the first-ever Chicago mayoral runoff, but he was defeated. Emanuel took 55 percent of the runoff vote in, winning 35 out of 50 wards, and captured all the Black wards, and voters in all but one Latine ward voted for Garc\u00eda.\u201cKaren Lewis anointed him. So she must have done her homework. We\u2019re going to get behind him because we support her,\u201d Cobb said, recalling Black leaders\u2019 sentiments at the time. \u201cSince he\u2019s been elevated to where he is now, he\u2019s now showing his true colors.\u201dThose same labor unions aren\u2019t rocking with Garc\u00eda this time around. In the 2023 mayoral race, CTU, SEIU and United Working Families have thrown their support behind Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson.\u00a0Many Black and brown political leaders have endorsed him too, including grassroots organizers such as Asha Ransby-Sporn and Vega, and elected officials such as Congresspersons Jonathan Jackson (IL-1) and Delia Ramirez (IL-3), state Rep. Lakesia Collins (9th District), Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward), Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward), and Ald. Rossana Rodr\u00edguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward).What happened? Over the last few years, Garc\u00eda has endorsed candidates and elected officials \u2014 including some who have caused harm to Black and brown communities, according to organizers. 25th Ward IPO chair Okere sees those actions as an example of him moving away from the progressive movement.In 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) for the City Council. In September 2022, Rodriguez voted in favor of leasing land that was once the site of the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s ALBA Homes to the Chicago Fire soccer team to build an $80-million training facility. CHA demolished the homes in 2007 and promised displaced families that they could return to a revitalized area. However, a joint report published by ProPublica and WTTW-TV found that less than a third of the promised new units were ever built.\u00a0Also in 2019, Garc\u00eda endorsed Mayor Lightfoot over Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, despite Lightfoot\u2019s tenure as Police Board president and her proposal to turn closed Chicago Public Schools (CPS) schools into mini police academies. Since then, Garc\u00eda has publicly regretted his Lightfoot endorsement.\u201cHe\u2019s an ally of the mayor. He\u2019s never critiqued her,\u201d Johnson said about Garc\u00eda in a Jan. 31 interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cHe supported her tenure until he decided that he wanted to run.\u201dIn January 2023, Garc\u00eda endorsed Aida Flores\u2019 campaign for 25th Ward alderperson against incumbent Ald. Byron Sighco-Lopez, a member of the Democratic Socialist Caucus who has advocated for progressive policies in the City Council.Sigcho-Lopez said he feels as though Garc\u00eda has not been siding with the interests of working people, and is instead aligning himself with \u201ccorporate Democrat interests.\u201d He cited the fact that Garc\u00eda has been linked to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan (D), who has been indicted on federal corruption charges, as one example.\u201cHe\u2019s tied to former Speaker Madigan. It\u2019s undeniable. He endorsed speaker Madigan at a time where there were not only allegations of corruption but also sexual misconduct in Madigan\u2019s organization,\u201d Sigcho-Lopez told The TRiiBE on Jan. 30. \u201cProperty taxes are skyrocketing in communities like Pilsen. Developers and corporations are trying to take over, and Congressman Garc\u00eda is siding with such power and such interest at the expense of working people.\u201d\u00a0According to Ald. David Moore (17th Ward), Garc\u00eda also pushed a Black leader, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), out of her position, which Moore said was a slap in the face of the Black community after they helped support Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2015 run for mayor.\u00a0In 2022, Garc\u00eda and U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez (IL-3) voted to support state Rep. Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Hernandez (D) \u2014 Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u2019s candidate \u2014 to head the Democratic Party of Illinois. According to the Chicago Crusader, Garc\u00eda\u2019s and Ramirez\u2019s votes led directly to Kelly\u2019s decision to drop out of the race. Hernandez won the election, becoming the first Latina woman in the role.For Moore, Garc\u00eda\u2019s choice to vote for Hernandez instead of Kelly shows that he is not the Black and brown coalition builder he proclaims himself to be.\u00a0\u201cYou will constantly hear Congressman Garc\u00eda say, \u2018I was there with Harold Washington.\u2019 Yet, [he] did not support this African American woman,\u201d Moore said.\u201cThis is a community that stood with you, that supported you, during the mayoral elections with Rahm, and he has not reciprocated back to the African-American community,\u201d Moore said about Garc\u00eda. \u201cSo when we say we want Robin [Kelly] to stay, he should have been on board with us.\u201dIn the 2022 primary election, Garc\u00eda endorsed Alexi Giannoulias over Moore to be the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State. In the 2023 Chicago election, Moore has expressed support for mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King on social media.Garc\u00eda endorsed State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx in 2016\u2014but only after she\u2019d already gotten an endorsement from Cook County Board president Toni Preckwinkle. Moore said he has not seen Garc\u00eda elevate Black people in the same way that they\u2019ve rallied for him.\u201cWe were intentional about getting behind him with Rahm Emanuel. We were intentional about helping him, whether it was his state representatives or state senators that he wanted to run. I was intentional about helping those candidates,\u201d Moore said.\u00a0 The candidates that Moore is referring to are Illinois State Rep. Aar\u00f3n Ortiz and Cook County Commissioner Alma Anaya.\u00a0Conversely, Moore said Ortiz and Anaya have both been intentional in their work to unify Black and brown communities.In a speech to business and political leaders at the City Club of Chicago in January, Garc\u00eda unveiled a public safety plan that emphasizes increased staffing and foot patrols.\u00a0\u201cI know some people are surprised to hear a guy like me, who spent decades as a community activist and community builder, supporting hiring police officers, but building the violence prevention programs in Little Village was only possible by having an understanding with police,\u201d Garc\u00eda said.In addition to fully staffing and funding the Chicago Police Department (CPD), increasing staffing levels and focusing on patrols, Garc\u00eda\u2019s safety plan pledges to fire CPD Supt. David Brown, invest in community intervention and prevention efforts and combat the root causes and social determinants of health.During the speech, Garc\u00eda said CPD staffing levels are at their lowest in recent history and estimated that the police department has had about 1,000 resignations between 2019 and August 2022. His public safety plan doesn\u2019t include what funds would be used to implement these initiatives, referring only to the city\u2019s still-unspent 2021 American Rescue Plan Act funding.\u00a0Following his speech, Garc\u00eda told reporters that he is not calling for an increase to the CPD budget. He said the department\u2019s nearly $2 billion budget is enough to \u201cmodernize the police department and staff it adequately.\u201dOrganizers and community members have criticized Garc\u00eda\u2019s public safety plan as no different than Lightfoot\u2019s current initiatives.\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes down to it, do more cops equal more safety? No, it doesn\u2019t. If that were the truth, then we would be the safest city in the world because we spend 40 percent of the budget on police officers,\u201d said Sa\u00fal Garc\u00eda, a Little Village resident and CPS high school teacher. Garc\u00eda is a member of the CTU and is backing Johnson in the race. \n        On Feb. 28, Chicago voters will elect 66 people to oversee the police department and have a say in reforms.This year the city will spend $1.94 billion on CPD, up from $1.88 billion in 2022.Since the 2020 uprisings, local and national organizers and progressive candidates have been demanding the reallocation of police budgets to community services.Here in Chicago, organizers under the GoodKids MadCity and the DefundCPD campaign have called for reallocating funds away from police budgets. Instead, they want those funds poured into communities and community resources, infrastructure and violence interruption.\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening for someone claiming to be progressive, yet, is kind of championing very old, tough on crime rhetoric,\u201d Asha Ransby-Sporn told The TRiiBE on Feb. 2.\u00a0Ransby-Sporn has been organizing around policing for years; she is also the South Side regional director for United Working Families. She said she doesn\u2019t believe Garc\u00eda\u2019s plans for policing are progressive. She supports Johnson and coordinates organizing efforts for his campaign on the South Side.\u00a0\u201cChuy has campaigned for mayor now twice on a platform that primarily rests on calling for more cops. That, to me, means he\u2019s not been someone who\u2019s unapologetically supported progressive issues that we\u2019re talking about and championing here locally in Chicago,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cHe\u2019s not committed to reopening mental health clinics. He\u2019s not taken stances that are in line with what Chicago communities have been calling for. \u201dWith just a few weeks left until the Feb. 28 election in Chicago, Ransby-Sporn believes Johnson\u2019s campaign\u2019s momentum is promising. She\u2019s encouraging voters to knock on doors, spread the word and ensure people are registered to vote. Additionally, she said, it\u2019s vital that voters examine the voting records and endorsements that candidates have received.\u00a0\u201cMany candidates continue to take up progressive talking points, but look at who they\u2019re connected to. Look at who they\u2019re meeting with and that will tell you a lot about who a candidate is accountable to,\u201d Ransby-Sporn said. \u201cI think that means a lot for how much we can trust them when they\u2019re in office to follow through on their promises.\u201dLongtime Pilsen resident Mateo Zapata sees Garc\u00eda as a progressive candidate compared to other Latine leaders of the former Hispanic Democratic Organization (HDO), which former Daley political aide Victor Reyes and Department of Streets and Sanitation commissioner Al Sanchez created and, during its heyday, according to the Reader, \u201cbullied independents on behalf\u201d of mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s political machine.\u201cWhen you look at Chuy from the trajectory of Latino representation within the Democrats in Chicago, he is progressive. Is he going to be a progressive mayor? That is something that he\u2019s going to have to prove to our city,\u201d Zapata told The TRiiBE on Jan. 19.In the Chicago Votes 2023 mayoral questionnaire, on a question about whether candidates will support Treatment Not Trauma, an ordinance that would send healthcare workers instead of cops to mental health crises, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201d In his public safety plan, Garc\u00eda said he would transition mental health and other interventions to civilian teams where appropriate.When asked if he would prioritize passing the Bring Chicago Home ordinance, which would marginally raise the transfer tax on real-estate sales above $1 million to fund homelessness abatement, in his first term, Garc\u00eda responded \u201cyes.\u201dAsked if he will commit to passing the Peace Book ordinance if elected, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d When asked if he would prioritize the reopening of the city\u2019s mental health clinics, Garc\u00eda responded that he \u201cleans no.\u201d"

  "title": "Police brutality survivors and former cops are running in Chicago\u2019s police district council races",
  "text": "This story was co-published with the Chicago Reader.At a forum on Police District Council races hosted on January 22 by the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) at CTU headquarters, dozens of candidates stood in lines that wrapped around a dais at the front of Jacqueline Vaughn Hall, waiting their turn to explain why they\u2019re running.\u00a0Nearly all of them are seeking office for the first time in their lives, but they spoke clearly and with conviction about the trauma they\u2019ve experienced at the hands of police.Many have family members who were brutalized or killed: Cynthia McFadden\u2019s father escaped white supremacist terror in the South by coming to Chicago during the Great Migration, only to be shot and killed by police at 47th and King Drive on the day he arrived. Coston Plummer\u2019s older brother was tortured for 39 hours and forced to falsely confess to murder by officers under notorious commander Jon Burge when he was just 15 years old, and remains in prison today. When Craig Carrington\u2019s sister was brutalized and arrested for protecting her children from police in 2004, he promised her that if he ever could, he would do something about it.They talked about running for Police District Council in order to heal\u2014not just themselves and their families, but entire communities whose relationships with public safety have long been fractured.\u201cThe amazing thing about these candidates who are running for district council is that they are overwhelmingly Black and Brown, overwhelmingly working class, and there\u2019s also a lot of poor people in the ranks,\u201d Frank Chapman, a CAARPR field organizer and a leader of the movement that ushered in the Police District Councils, told the crowd. \u201cThis is who is running. So just on the basis of that, this election on February 28 will be the most democratic election that this city has ever seen.\u201d\u00a0Of the 112 candidates running in the newly-created Police District Council races, 63 used resources provided by CAARPR to file election paperwork. These 63 candidates support police accountability: overwhelmingly, they want Chicago Police Department funding to be redirected to violence prevention and transformative justice programs, for care workers to accompany police to mental health crises, and for their churches, block clubs, and community organizations to be included in public safety. Despite what they have personally endured at the hands of police, only a few want to totally defund or abolish CPD.They described knocking on countless doors in Chicago\u2019s coldest months to discuss that opportunity with voters. Meridth Hammer, a candidate in the Fourth District, was hoarse from talking about public safety with voters day in and day out. They are ordinary people whose resilience carries them as they fight for a seat at the table.Ordinary people have always been at the center of this struggle. The movement for community control of the police, or CCOP, was led by revolutionaries, but it has always been carried onward by neighborhood people.\n        We sat down with each Black mayoral candidate to see if they have what it takes to lead Chicago into an equitable future.In Chicago, CCOP was first conceived by the Black Panther Party and Chairman Fred Hampton in the 1960s. A charismatic visionary, Chairman Fred built a Rainbow Coalition of Black, Brown, and working-class white residents who, fed up with police violence, gentrification, and not-so-benign neglect of their communities, became revolutionaries.\u00a0Neutralizing revolutionary coalitions was at the top of the FBI\u2019s list of COINTELPRO goals, and the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Office and Chicago Police Department conspired to assassinate Hampton on December 4, 1969. His murder only spurred the Panthers and Rainbow Coalition to redouble their efforts for control of police. Within four years, they built a citywide campaign for elected civilian police boards in every police district. Ultimately, Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s political machine repelled the effort. The movement regrouped and found other inroads to power as revolutionaries ran for office.\u00a0Over the ensuing decades, elected officials made several attempts to establish oversight of the police. Following a series of police brutality incidents, U.S. representative Ralph Metcalfe (IL-1) convened a Congressional blue-ribbon panel in 1972 that led to the creation of the Office of Professional Standards (OPS). Comprised of civilian members of CPD, it became notorious for stifling misconduct investigations. After a brutality incident was caught on camera in 2007, the City Council voted (with Mayor Richard M. Daley\u2019s approval) to replace OPS with the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA). Moving oversight out of the department did little to increase accountability. Following the CPD murder of Laquan McDonald, the City Council (with Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s blessing) replaced IPRA with the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates misconduct and makes recommendations to the Police Board, in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through it all, Chicago police continued killing and brutalizing people. The victims\u2019 families never stopped fighting for justice. Many have been doing so for decades, often on their own, wandering the wilderness of a city that took police harassment, torture, and murder of its residents for granted. The best most could hope for was a cash settlement. The price of police violence was shunted onto Chicago\u2019s residents as the City\u2019s payouts for police misconduct ballooned to more than $50 million a year.In 2012, one police killing, of Rekia Boyd by off-duty CPD officer Dante Servin, became a flashpoint around which the scattered survivors of police violence coalesced. The Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR) spent a decade painstakingly building a movement rooted in the communities. In 2020, the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police set off rebellions around the country. Amid the uprisings, GAPA and CAARPR formed a coalition and, with their allies in City Council, passed the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance in 2021 despite Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s objections.The district councils that the ECPS ordinance created will not have the kind of direct oversight powers the Panthers initially sought for district-level boards in the CCOP movement, like hiring and firing police and setting department policy. However, they will have the right to engage with district commanders and recommend restorative justice and other alternative approaches to safety. Among other duties, they\u2019re also charged with helping community members request investigative information from COPA and CPD. The councils\u2019 effectiveness at serving and engaging with the community will most likely vary by district.\u00a0Each of the 22 three-member councils will send one representative to meetings where they will nominate the citywide Community Commission on Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA). It is in that commission that ECPS achieves civilian power\u2014in a layered, not direct, manner\u2014over the degree to which police are held accountable. The CCPSA can hire and fire the chief administrator of COPA. It can also hold hearings about the police superintendent and take a vote of no confidence that triggers City Council hearings and a vote to retain or fire the superintendent.\u00a0The hope of the ECPS organizers is that the CCPSA will exercise these powers should COPA or the superintendent fail to hold officers who brutalize or kill accountable.\u00a0Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her allies initially resisted the proposals brought forth by organizers, and it took grueling negotiations between organizers and the mayor\u2019s office before the City Council passed the ECPS ordinance. Then, the mayor and her allies slow-walked its implementation. Lightfoot\u2019s floor leader, Alderperson Michelle Harris, delayed the opening of applications for the interim CCPSA for months. And although the ECPS ordinance required the mayor to appoint members to the interim CCPSA by January 2022, she waited until August to do so. At that point, it was too late for the CCPSA to review the mayor\u2019s police department budget and recommend changes to the City Council, one of their key duties mandated by the ordinance.\u00a0The police are aware of the ramifications of reform. Just as the machine poured its efforts into thwarting the CCOP ordinance 50 years ago, the Fraternal Order of Police and its allies have organized to undermine ECPS.\u00a0The FOP has spent at least $25,000 to get their people on the ballot and try to knock progressive candidates off, and they gave the green light to one of their election attorneys, Perry Abbasi, to run in the 25th District. In Northwest-Side districts like the 16th and Southwest-Side districts like the 22nd, where neighborhoods like Galewood and Mount Greenwood are home to many police, nearly everyone running has ties to the FOP.\u00a0In the Fifth District, Thomas McMahon, a former police lieutenant who has 21 misconduct allegations, is running. He hired his own attorney to challenge the ballot petitions of Robert McKay, a candidate in the same district who helped usher in reform to the CFD in the 1990s; the reformer is now running as a write-in candidate. Lee Bielecki, a retired sergeant who has 26 allegations of misconduct, is running in the 22nd District. In the 12th, Juan Lopez, a former state police trooper who was fired and charged with seven felonies for firing six shots into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home after seeing her with another man, is running. Lopez was acquitted of the felonies, for which he was facing 26 years in prison, and convicted of a misdemeanor.\u00a0But the block club members, teachers, and pastors who stood at the microphones at CTU headquarters know the stakes of this race better than anyone. They want the opportunity to ensure that the radical proposition they fought for and won\u2014a chance for the community to have a say in creating public safety and holding police accountable\u2014is borne out. According to Chapman, that opportunity is revolutionary.\u201cThese people are running out of dedication to a cause,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cAnd their dedication is that it\u2019s time, in this city, to hold the police accountable for the crimes that they commit against that community.\u201d For these candidates, it is time indeed.

  "title": "2023 Chicago Police District Councils Voter Guide",
  "text": "This story was originally published by The Chicago Reader & South Side WeeklyAfter decades of struggle by thousands of people who organized, marched, petitioned, prayed, and collectively clamored for the right to have a say in how their communities are policed, on February 28 voters will elect 66 people to serve on police district councils across the city.The battle for community control of the police has been waged for more than a half-century. Deputy chairman Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party sparked the first push in the late 1960s (see\u00a0Fifty years of struggle). In the decades since, organizers have won incremental concessions. The Office of Professional Standards was created within the police department in 1974. It was replaced by the Independent Police Review Authority in 2007, which was in turn replaced by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability a decade later. Each agency was created thanks to the tireless efforts of ordinary Chicagoans. None of the people serving on them were democratically elected.\u00a0The police district councils will be elected. Three councilors will serve in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts for four-year terms. They\u2019ll be tasked with building connections between police and communities, developing community policing initiatives, getting community input on CPD policies, and ensuring the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) hears the community\u2019s concerns.The Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that created the councils and the CCPSA is the result of\u00a0 a decade of organizing spurred by the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd by Dante Servin, an off-duty police detective, in Douglass Park. Servin, found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter because the judge determined he\u2019d shot Boyd intentionally, resigned from the department with a pension. In response to that killing, organizers began the push for community control of police anew.In the ensuing years, as high-profile killings by police across the country mounted, they catalyzed the Black Lives Matter movement, a nationwide effort to get government officials to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stem the epidemic of violence wrought upon Black and Brown communities by the very officers tasked with keeping them safe. In Chicago and elsewhere, the police kept killing people. The victims were often unarmed, and they were almost always Black.\u00a0In 2014, then-officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him. When video footage of the shooting was released, thousands of Chicagoans protested downtown, shutting down the Magnificent Mile during Black Friday and staging a sit-in at the office of State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez, who activists said had mishandled the prosecutions of both Van Dyke and Servin. In the wake of the protests, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, and the U.S. Department of Justice placed the CPD under a federal consent decree.Everything changed in 2020, as protests of the murder of George Floyd by then-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin swept the nation.\u00a0In Chicago and elsewhere, the rebellions (and the police response to them) turned into a long, hot summer. In its midst, the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression formed a coalition, Empowering Communities for Public Safety. With thousands of ordinary people at its back and in the streets, the coalition negotiated the language of the ECPS ordinance with the mayor. It passed in 2021.Chicagoans have been promised police reform before, and the department\u2019s entrenched attitude against change could make some wonder how effective the district councils will be. One clue to the power they may wield lies in who\u2019s on the ballot. In addition to ordinary residents and dedicated activists, several candidates with law enforcement ties are running. And the Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s election attorney filed challenges to several progressive candidates\u2019 ballot petitions, is listed as the contact person for six more on Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (CBEC) filings, and is himself running.\u00a0We\u00a0sent questionnaires to district council candidates, interviewed as many as we could reach, and researched their backgrounds using sources ranging from social media to biographies compiled by the ECPS coalition. We\u2019ve compiled the responses below. Early voting begins on January 26 at the CBEC supersite, and on February 13 in all 50 wards.\u00a0\u2014Jim DaleyAn attorney, Brown graduated from the Catholic University of America and Columbus School of Law.

  "title": "2023 Before the Polls: Q&A with Ja\u2019Mal Green",
  "text": "Ja\u2019Mal Green is going to be seen and heard. A familiar face at protests seeking justice for Laquan McDonald and other victims of police violence, a 21-year-old Green made national headlines in 2017 when he told an MSNBC Townhall audience that former Mayor Rahm Emanuel does not care about Black people.Today, he continues to confront politicians head-on; during recent candidate forums, he\u2019s called out opponents for holding office for years but not acting urgently to heal community trauma and improve conditions for Black and brown youth.\u00a0On Jan. 3, Green invited The TRiiBE to his campaign headquarters off 87th and Halsted in Auburn Gresham. Covered with \u201cJa\u2019Mal Green for Mayor\u201d signs, with a coach campaign bus parked outside, his HQ, formerly a Chase Bank, stands out in an otherwise dilapidated strip mall. To get inside the HQ teeming with volunteers, Green\u2019s children among them, we had to present photo IDs.During our interview, Green did not back down from his longtime views about policing.\u00a0\u201cWe will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence,\u201d he said. In his public safety plan, Green calls for police reform that makes \u201cpolicing more attractive.\u201dHe shared ideas about creating a city-owned public bank that would give residents the power to invest back into their communities. The bank\u2019s priorities would be affordable housing, home ownership, new development and small business lending.\u00a0He also wants to cut violence in half, create 10,000 new homeowners and launch \u201cuniversal 3K,\u201d or preschool for children as young as three.\u00a0However, without any executive political experience, some Chicago voters wonder how Green, the youngest candidate in the race, will bring his lofty ideas to fruition.\u00a0Also, he\u2019s been linked to some controversy in recent years. In 2021, he circulated rumors on social media about Lightfoot resigning. He tweeted: \u201cLori Lightfoot is resigning tomorrow in a stunning end to her mayorship.\u201d He later issued an apology, and the tweet has since been deleted.When Black, queer, women-led liberation organizers in Chicago such as BYP 100, Assata\u2019s Daughters and Let Us Breathe Collective were voicing their opposition to Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 campaign because of her affiliation with the police board, Green endorsed her. He said he advised her on the Youth Commission and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but then the two began to clash. In 2021 he called Lightfoot out for blocking his effort to turn the Emanuel-shuttered Garrett Morgan Elementary School in Auburn-Gresham into a $15 million youth center.And in December 2022, a years-long feud between Green and opponent Willie Wilson\u2019s camp boiled over when audio recording allegedly between Wilson political consultant Rickey Hendon and Green campaign volunteer Kevin Hobby leaked on social media, detailing a bribe for Green\u2019s team to drop the petition challenge against Wilson. In 2019, Hendon challenged Green\u2019s petition signatures and Green dropped out of the race.\u00a0Read our full interview with Green, as part of our 2023 Before the Polls mayoral candidate interview series.(The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)The TRiiBE: Chicago millennials defied expectations in the 2022 midterm elections as the second-largest voting bloc. In 2012, Black Chicago millennials, following the police murder of Rekia Boyd, also laid the groundwork for the emerging Black liberation movement. You were part of the organizing community that sought justice for Laquan McDonald. Why is Chicago ready for millennial leadership at the mayoral level? Ja\u2019Mal Green: Chicagoans have seen that the city's politics have not worked and are not in the best interests of everyday working-class people. We are now in a pivotal time where the young generation is hopeless. Young people are dying, committing acts of violence or being caught doing carjackings. Some are trying to raise families in Chicago.\u00a0There's just no type of hope right now. Families all across the city, they're leaving. Businesses are leaving. Chicago is willing to take a chance on someone who has a plan, cares about everyday citizens, is younger and will bring forth innovative ideas.\u00a0One of the biggest things in this race is that Chicago is ready for change. They've yet to get the results they've needed for so long. They haven't felt safe for so long. [Elected officials have] made promises they didn't keep and, [Chicago residents] are ready to try something new.You grew up on both the South and West sides. How did each side of town shape your politics and outlook on life?I grew up in Gresham. It\u2019s been my home for all my life. The first block that I lived on was 86th and Union. Those were homeowners who cared about the block and every young person on the block.I had Mr. Riley, who just recently died, who would give me a dollar for every \u201cA\u201d I had, and we had a village. Looking back at all the other places I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s no other block like that. So that gave me a foundation that showed me what a village looks like and how people can come together and love on each other and look after each other and look after each other's kids.My dad was in K-town. I\u2019d visit him for long-term stays and on weekends. I saw the differences on each side of the city, where communities didn\u2019t have the resources they needed, where folks were suffering and needed mental health services, or they lacked a home, or some were engaging in some type of criminal activity because they don't have an alternative. Everything I've seen in these neighborhoods made me the person I am today to know that we need more of a people-centered approach to politics.Why are you entering the Chicago mayoral race for a second consecutive time? Why not start smaller and run for a seat on the Chicago City Council?No city council member's ever  been elected mayor of the city of Chicago. So the second piece of that is the vision, and the agenda that needs to be moved forward in our city needs to be moved forward at the top, and that's why I'm running for mayor. I\u2019m not looking to be a career politician and go seat to seat. I\u2019m looking to make the impact that I need to make on a large scale and then move out of the way, pass the torch, and inspire another generation to step up. I ran for mayor last time and withdrew before the ballot.This is technically my first run because I'm actually on the ballot. We didn't have the infrastructure that we needed [back] then. This time we have a lot of support throughout the city. My name recognition is very high throughout the city. The dozens of businesses and thousands of people who have helped power this campaign have been amazing. So I decided to jump in this time because I was called and because folks want a new voice, a young voice representing all of Chicago.The rumor mill, or just the streets, said that you were hoping to get a position within Lightfoot\u2019s administration last time.No. I would never work for an administration. Because I don't need to. I have many businesses, and it would be a conflict for me. So with Lori, I advised her when she asked and helped with policies until we just couldn't get along.Is there something specific that you can name that you were helping or advising?Yes. The Youth Commission. I did a little series with her online through the pandemic early on to help her talk about COVID-19. The videos had about 100,000 views online and they did well. So I tried to help humanize her and get her to come left to real policies that made sense. But Lori is Lori. At the end of the day, I recognize why we didn\u2019t like each other for six years before that. I just tried to say I want the city to be better, and I\u2019m not asking you for anything. I don\u2019t need the money. I don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t need a job. I want these policies so that these young people have the spaces and pathways to be productive. I couldn\u2019t achieve that with her and this administration, so I\u2019m running to make it happen.Young Black and brown children are sometimes forgotten when discussing gun violence. You're typically vocal about gun violence, especially when it impacts children. How will you invest in safety? And are there ways outside of policing that you will invest in safety? Can you describe what that will look like?Today, we released a $5 billion plan. That is called EPIC: Economic Prosperity Prevention, Intervention, and CPD reform. Our program's basis is to ensure that we create thriving neighborhoods where we invest in young people and where CPD is a support system and not an oppressive force. We will not be investing more money into increasing police in this city. That is not how you solve violence.\u00a0We will take a holistic approach and do things the right way. So when you talk about economic prosperity, our lucky number is 10,000. We want to create 10,000 new homeowners by instituting single-family mortgage bonds and back-home loans on a city level each year so that we can repopulate neighborhoods. So, folks who are in or have left those neighborhoods and have roots, whether they move to the suburbs or other cities, we incentivize them to come back by backing their loan, giving them a down payment and closing cost assistance.I would love to circle back to that because I have questions about affordable housing and renting. So one of the pieces is called Chicago PPP: Prosperity Push Pilot. Essentially, what it is, is that we're going to have a direct cash assistance program, where we're going to give $1,000 a month to 10,000 families each year to push them out of poverty.Participants of this program will all be required to take a financial literacy class. Then they'll also have 90 days after the start of payments to do one of four things: obtain housing, educational enrollment, substance abuse treatment, or secure a job opportunity. They will do one of those four things. After that, they can continue getting cash assistance for the year.\u00a0We will evaluate them that year, and they can reapply for a second and final year. With this $150 million program, it is important to give the foundation to people who need it and push them out of poverty. Many studies have shown that in providing direct cash to folks living in hard times, most of that money is spent on their basic needs, whether it be housing, food, etc.You\u2019ve said that you want Chicago taxpayers to stop footing the bill for police misconduct lawsuits. You also mentioned wanting police officers to have insurance. Is that still the case?That's still the case. We're still vetting it and figuring out how to implement it. We are not going to continue paying $100 million for police misconduct. It's not going to happen under my watch, and it will be a priority of my administration to implement and pass a plan so that that bill goes to someone else.It should go on behalf of the police. If they have liability insurance, insurance companies can assess the liability on whether they are a risk based on their complaints. So if they get million-dollar insurance cases, that company will drop them. If they don\u2019t have insurance, they can\u2019t be police officers on the streets of Chicago.\u00a0Why should we continue to allow police officers to rack up millions of dollars in settlements, and there\u2019s no accountability? Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan 16 times. But before that case, he had already six-figure settlements of cases in which he acted improperly.We got to start holding them accountable. We\u2019re also going to fine officers up to $5,000 if [they] turn off their body cameras or have improper use of equipment.\u00a0We will have zero tolerance for police officers affiliating with hate groups.We will implement an app where folks can rate their interactions with police officers. Suppose you have an interaction with the police. In that case, you\u2019ll be able to rate the police officer, as well as upload data in real-time [to] have evidence of a case. They can go to an investigative agency to be able to look at it, and we can reward police officers who get good interactions [from] the community too.On the other hand, we\u2019re also going to help police officers on the force. Suicides are at an all-time high. We\u2019re going to increase the number of therapists per police district, and we\u2019re going to change our work schedule to a four- or three-day work weeks with one mental health day in between so that we can start to get control of the suicide rates in the police department.On your website, you mentioned wanting to create healing houses where those suffering from mental health issues can find refuge. And you also just alluded to having a trained social worker be sent to homes to de-escalate in non-emergency situations. That sounds similar to Treatment Not Trauma. Do you support that?We will pass Treatment Not Trauma. We need to reopen the mental health facilities that Rahm Emanuel shut down.What is your plan for that?We plan to reopen clinics and find the best places throughout the communities to open wellness centers that use a holistic approach to mental health. It will be an institution where you can get counseling services, yoga, boxing, karate, massage therapy and spa treatment.We need to invest in that so that people all over the city, whether it be young people, police or whoever, can look at this institution as a place where they can wind down. Our innovative idea is to take what they are doing and expand it to an institution that everyone would want to go to.As a millennial, you seem more connected to Black and brown youth in Chicago in ways that the other campaigns aren't, primarily through your work and Majostee All Stars. Why is supporting and uplifting the voices of young people in Chicago important to you, and is that a commitment you'll maintain if elected mayor?One of the things that I did get this mayor to do was pass my idea to have the first-ever Youth Commission in the city to advise the mayor's office. It\u2019s super important for young voices to be heard. I was young once. I can remember people saying you're young, and you need to stay in your place or your voice doesn't matter.\u00a0So that's why it's important for me to make sure that we invest in young people and make sure that we remove the barriers. Our leaders have constantly held on to the power and money; essentially, they're waiting to die. Then when they die, what's the next plan? Because they don't train up the next generation, they don't put young people in positions of power. They don't invest in young people. They just want us to keep voting for them until they're 100. That's not fair. That's not how that goes. That's not how that should be. Young people need the opportunity to fill seats to grow and thrive, and so that's my commitment.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted already existing disparities in Black and brown schools. What initiatives or policies will you implement to invest in neighborhood elementary and high schools? So Black and brown children won't have to leave their communities to attend school. The quality of education should be determined by the median income of the neighborhood. One of the biggest problems of our city is that we\u2019ve got a selective enrollment school system.We got an enrollment-based formula in the state and disinvested communities. Therefore, you have disinvested schools. I went to many public schools and had challenges. I was one of the brightest kids in every school, and I also had difficulties with my behavior. I displayed certain behaviors that schools weren't equipped to address or equipped to give me the attention that I needed.What happens in the district is that if you have a kid with challenges, they will write an IEP (Individualized Education Program) and try to get some medicine or something.\u00a0\u00a0So there\u2019s no real holistic approach. Young people from these neighborhoods who are going through so much trauma, who have so much pain, who could be homeless and hungry, walk into a school building and be expected to learn two-plus-two without the proper curriculum, books or technology. We\u2019re failing young people each and every day in Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0We need to ensure that we\u2019re pushing the state legislature to change the formula for public schools. It must be needs-based. We want to invest in making sure that trade and tech hubs are in schools all across the city. We need alternatives for young people and make sure that they\u2019re learning skills and different career fields that they can go down.\u00a0We need to be investing in young people starting early. So we\u2019re presenting a plan for pre-K to ensure that there are programs and public schools throughout the city where kids as young as three years old can start learning before they even go on to pre-K that\u2019ll make them smarter and stimulate their minds. It\u2019s a good thing for single mothers who are looking for childcare and want to work.We need to teach these young people early so they can have the skills they need to be the best they can be when they get older. Universal 3K is a plan that we want to implement as well.Young people in Chicago have very few places to gather safely and socialize. How do you suggest that we non-punitively support youth within and outside CPS? We need to invest in safe spaces. There are a lot of people around the city that are doing good work with young people. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and be the driving force behind everything. We need to look at where the folks doing the work are and go to them and say, \u201chow can you expand? How much do you need to expand?\u201d So that we can have real safe spaces where young people can grow and thrive. So we will allocate a lot of money to create safe spaces for young people in our communities.Are you familiar with GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book ordinance?\u00a0 If so, does supporting that ordinance align with your commitment to Chicago\u2019s youth?Yes, I mentored many young people involved in GoodKid MadCity\u2019s Peace Book over the years. They put together a good plan.I\u2019m sure there are some tweaks that we\u2019ll be able to tweak and make better. The point is there is an organization of young people who come forward and say, \u201chere\u2019s a plan,\u201d especially those young people putting their lives on the line daily and being on the front lines. They need a voice, right? So bring them to the table, hear the plan, and see how we can strengthen that plan, work together and create something that will work.In your campaign video, you announced wanting to support and expand homeownership. Earlier in our conversation, you talked about wanting to get 10,000 or more new homeowners over time. You have an existing framework or initiative that you created through My Turn to Own. Is that a model you believe can be used on a larger scale? Why or why not?So My Turn to Own is an organization that teaches people how to become homeowners, gives them the financial literacy they need. Then, after putting them through the process and getting them to own a home, we also teach them how to maintain that home in the process, too.\u00a0This is super important because we will be backing home loans on a large scale. You got people in communities who don't even know their credit scores and don't even know how to qualify because they've been renting for so many decades that it's never been on their radar. So that will be a key piece of our administration to expand something like that city-wide.A lot of our readers are renters. What initiatives will you implement to protect people from displacement and support people experiencing homelessness?We\u2019ve got to increase the affordable housing supply. It makes no sense that we can\u2019t even build 2,500 affordable housing units a year.\u00a0 We will give tax subsidies to big box stores, churches, banks and folks who own big buildings to build affordable housing units. We will incentivize folks to build on top of any single-floor space or a single-floor building.\u00a0The Public Bank is another big piece that I talk about a lot. We will create our own economic engine by having a public bank that invests in home loans, affordable houses and small businesses. That profit from the bank goes right back to city services.So we're going to build income-based housing in the city of Chicago, and the public sector is going to have a lot of control over those rents. Then, as part of incentivizing those affordable housing units, we're also going to make sure that there are criteria in place and caps for those prices for those units they're building.\u00a0I'm a big supporter of community benefits agreements for those private developers who are building. We can't wait on a private developer to come into the neighborhood to build affordable housing units.Do you support the Bring Chicago Home proposal?Yes. I support Bring Chicago Home's proposal to have a dedicated funding stream for homelessness and affordable housing. Yes.Earlier in the conversation, you mentioned who you're accountable to. We've witnessed mayoral candidates of the past co-opt progressive and abolitionist language and make big promises to Black Chicagoans while campaigning, only to renege on those promises when in office. If elected, how can Black Chicagoans hold you accountable for the policies you promised them while campaigning?We'll put different things in place to allow organizers to have a seat at the table. For example, we're looking at a commission, some sort of powerbroker, where organizers from labor and folks on the front lines can have a large voice in the mayor's office.\u00a0That's key to me. We expect to be held accountable for everything we say. I'm running on my track record. I'm the only one with a track record of doing all these things.\u00a0When you get into government, things can change. That's why people don't trust politicians. I'm trying to change that. I want the trust of Chicagoans, and so everything that I say, I'm going to put forth the best effort to do so. We're looking at ways to allow folks to hold us accountable easily. This is a word game, and I'm giving Chicagoans my word."

  "title": "Lightfoot calls CPS teacher emails a \u2018mistake\u2019",
  "text": "Today, Mayor Lori Lightfoot told The TRiiBE that it was a mistake for a member of her campaign\u00a0 to send emails to Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage them to help with her re-election campaign in exchange for school credit.\u00a0At a press conference this afternoon after her interview with The TRiiBE, Lightfoot said that she spoke to CPS CEO Pedro Martinez and Chicago Board of Education president Miguel del Valle and apologized to them for \u201cthis unnecessary distraction and mistake,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters.\u00a0She added that there was no coordination or coercion between her campaign and CPS in sending the emails to teachers.\u201cThere was no coercion, no intent to do that, by any means by this young woman, and no city resources were used. The outreach to the CPS teachers via their emails was a mistake that should not have happened,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0She also told reporters that the campaign staffer who sent the email would not be fired. Lightfoot said doing so would be the easy political thing to do but explained that it wasn\u2019t the appropriate action to take. Instead, she\u2019s calling what happened a teachable moment.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that I\u2019m a role model to young women across the city, and I have an obligation given that to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to teach and mentor,\u201d Lightfoot said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to learn and for me to be a mentor and nurture her,\u201d she added.\u00a0Also, on Thursday, the City Colleges of Chicago confirmed receiving an email from Lightfoot\u2019s campaign last August seeking student volunteers.\u201cCity Colleges staff notified the campaign of CCC\u2019s ethics policy and purged the emails from CCC accounts. City Colleges is not aware of having received subsequent campaign emails but is looking into the matter,\u201d the statement reads.\u00a0On Wednesday evening, Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s campaign came under fire after asking Chicago Public School (CPS) teachers to encourage students to help her get re-elected in exchange for school credit. WTTW Politics Reporter Heather Cherone first reported the story.\u00a0\u201cLate yesterday afternoon, I learned that in an effort to recruit young people to the campaign . . . a campaign staffer accessed publicly available email addresses for CPS teachers,\u201d Lightfoot said in a one-on-one interview with The TRiiBE before a Thursday afternoon press conference. \u201cObviously, that was a mistake. From day one, we erected not just a line but a wall, between the campaign political side and any official side,\u201d she said.\u00a0The campaign staffer \u201cunderstands the magnitude of the issue that has been created,\u201d Lightfoot added.\u201cI explained to her personally why this could not happen, and what the implications were. I think she gets it. We have reiterated our ethics standards, and why that wall is important to the entire staff again today.\u201d\u201cIt was a mistake, it shouldn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m confident that won\u2019t happen again.\u201dMayoral candidates such as Brandon Johnson, Paul Vallas and Ald. Roderick Sawyer were quick to issue statements condemning the emails. Alderpersons Daniel LaSpata, Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez and Byron Sigcho-Lopez issued a joint statement today that characterized the emails as \u201ccoercion of government employees to support her re-election campaign.\u201dOn Thursday, CPS inspector general Will Fletcher announced an investigation of the incident. \u201c[W]e are currently gathering information to determine which, if any, policies have been violated,\u201d he told WGN News.\u00a0The district has ethics guidelines for political activity. They state, \u201cA political campaign should not be using the CPS email system to solicit volunteers and donations. Please report the behavior and forward the emails to Ethics Advisor.\u201dThe Chicago Board of Ethics plans to discuss the matter at its next meeting, scheduled for Jan. 23, according to WTTW.\u00a0\u201cThey have every right to look into it, and if there is a need for us to respond, then we\u2019ll cooperate fully,\u201d Lightfoot said in response to a question about agencies like the Board of Ethics and the CPS inspector general launching investigations into the matter.\u00a0"

  "text": "Housing advocates with the BCH coalition need aldermanic support to get a ballot measure approved that would ask Chicago voters if the city should increase the real-estate transfer tax for buyers who purchase residential or commercial properties for more than $1 million. Those funds would be redirected toward efforts to combat homelessness.\u00a0The resolution is currently in Chicago\u2019s City Council\u2019s rules committee and, with the City Council\u2019s approval, could become a ballot question in the upcoming February 2023 municipal election.\u00a0The resolution was on Tuesday\u2019s agenda for the rules committee, as were two other ballot measures. However, that meeting was canceled hours before the committee was set to meet.\u00a0And on Monday, a special meeting for the City Council took place to discuss the BCH proposal.\u00a0The meeting was scheduled to start at 9 a.m. but was moved to 11:30 a.m. because there weren\u2019t enough City Council members to discuss the proposal.\u00a0That meeting was scheduled by sponsors of the resolution, including Alds: Maria Hadden (49th Ward), Carlos Ramirez Rosa (35th Ward), Daniel La Spata (1st Ward), Matt Martin (47th Ward) and Andre Vasquez (40th Ward).\u00a0Hadden said the meeting was a hearing to allow members of the public and City Council members to weigh in on the resolution. She added that they weren\u2019t asking council members to vote on the resolution.\u00a0Only 19 City Council members were present at the first meeting, but at least 26 needed to be present to move forward with the meeting.\u00a0\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t want to have a real estate transfer tax increase for a variety of reasons. So, even though we weren\u2019t asking council members to vote on the issue, there are some people who didn\u2019t want to aid the cause in any way. There were also a bunch of people who said they would come for the hearing because it is our job to show up for City Council meetings,\u201d Hadden told The TRiiBE on Nov. 15, referring to City Council members who weren\u2019t present for the meeting.\u00a0At 11:30 a.m on Monday, the meeting started for a second time, but there still weren\u2019t enough City Council members to move forward. This time, 25 members were present\u2014just one person shy of the 26-member requirement for a quorum.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m disgusted, hurt and upset at the 25 other alderpeople that did not show up [and] hid like cowards, because they\u2019d rather do what the mayor [Mayor Lori Lightfoot] tells them to do than do their job. They should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said April Harris, a grassroots leader of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless.\n         During her 2023 budget address, Mayor Lightfoot proposed $200 million in investments for the homeless. However, housing advocates say a one-time payment isn\u2019t enough to solve the problem.Harris and other BCH coalition members were present at City Hall on Monday and were prepared to give public comment during Monday\u2019s meeting. But because there wasn\u2019t a quorum, the meeting adjourned and they weren\u2019t allowed to speak.\u00a0\u201cWhy are you an alderperson if you don\u2019t care about your ward or what\u2019s going on in your ward?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\u00a0The BCH coalition has been pushing its proposal since 2019.The ballot measure would ask Chicago voters if the city should increase the real estate transfer tax by 253 percent for buyers who purchase residential or commercial properties for more than $1 million. Those funds would be redirected from the city to combat homelessness by providing permanent affordable housing and the services necessary to obtain and maintain permanent housing in Chicago.The future of the BCH\u2019s proposal is up in the air. Hadden explained that time is of the essence for the measure to be added to February\u2019s municipal election ballot. To be included on the ballot, the City Council would have to vote and approve it before the Chicago Board of Elections\u2019 Dec. 11 deadline, Hadden explained.\u201cBecause there\u2019s a deadline, no matter what the issue is, if it\u2019s not approved by a certain date, it can\u2019t be on the ballot,\u201d she said.\u00a0If the next City Council meeting were to take place on Dec. 7 and the resolution was approved for a vote, then there would still be enough time for it to be included on the February ballot. At the time this article was being published, the next full meeting for the body is Dec. 14, according to the city clerk\u2019s website.\u00a0Hadden, like Harris, is frustrated with how things have unfolded this week in the City Council.\u201cThe urgency of City Council and the mayor needing to act\u2014I can\u2019t understate it, so it\u2019s deeply frustrating. Not to have people disagree with the solution we\u2019re offering but to prevent us from moving forward and not have an alternative,\u201d Hadden said.\u00a0This year, Hadden said, at least 15-30 people in her ward who are experiencing homelessness live in Touhy Park. Her ward includes Rogers Park and parts of the West Ridge neighborhood.\u00a0She also reiterated that the city needs a dedicated fund to address homelessness.\u201cIf we had more money, we could be doing more rental assistance regularly, and I\u2019d have fewer people living in [Touhy Park] right now. It\u2019s not a fault or failure of our programs; it is a gap in the amount of money that we\u2019ve got. And so right now, we have a lot of money that we\u2019re using, and it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWhat happens when that money is gone?\u201d\u00a0Hadden is referring to funds from the Chicago Recovery Plan. This plan includes funding from the American Rescue Act, also known as the COVID-19 stimulus package. President Joe Biden signed the economic stimulus bill into law in March 2021. The city of Chicago was given about $1.9 billion from Congress in 2021. The city has until 2025 to use those funds, she added.\u00a0\u201cSo that\u2019s really the challenge I put out there to colleagues, to the [Lightfoot] administration, to folks who don\u2019t want to see the real estate transfer tax increase.How are you going to help us find $150 [million] to $200 million a year for the services that Chicagoans desperately need?\u201d she asked.\u00a0"

  "title": "2023 Chicago Police District Councils Voter Guide",
  "text": "This story was originally published by The Chicago Reader & South Side WeeklyAfter decades of struggle by thousands of people who organized, marched, petitioned, prayed, and collectively clamored for the right to have a say in how their communities are policed, on February 28 voters will elect 66 people to serve on police district councils across the city.The battle for community control of the police has been waged for more than a half-century. Deputy chairman Fred Hampton and the Black Panther Party sparked the first push in the late 1960s (see\u00a0Fifty years of struggle). In the decades since, organizers have won incremental concessions. The Office of Professional Standards was created within the police department in 1974. It was replaced by the Independent Police Review Authority in 2007, which was in turn replaced by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability a decade later. Each agency was created thanks to the tireless efforts of ordinary Chicagoans. None of the people serving on them were democratically elected.\u00a0The police district councils will be elected. Three councilors will serve in each of the city\u2019s 22 police districts for four-year terms. They\u2019ll be tasked with building connections between police and communities, developing community policing initiatives, getting community input on CPD policies, and ensuring the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) hears the community\u2019s concerns.The Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance that created the councils and the CCPSA is the result of\u00a0 a decade of organizing spurred by the 2012 killing of 22-year-old Rekia Boyd by Dante Servin, an off-duty police detective, in Douglass Park. Servin, found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter because the judge determined he\u2019d shot Boyd intentionally, resigned from the department with a pension. In response to that killing, organizers began the push for community control of police anew.In the ensuing years, as high-profile killings by police across the country mounted, they catalyzed the Black Lives Matter movement, a nationwide effort to get government officials to do something\u2014anything\u2014to stem the epidemic of violence wrought upon Black and Brown communities by the very officers tasked with keeping them safe. In Chicago and elsewhere, the police kept killing people. The victims were often unarmed, and they were almost always Black.\u00a0In 2014, then-officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing him. When video footage of the shooting was released, thousands of Chicagoans protested downtown, shutting down the Magnificent Mile during Black Friday and staging a sit-in at the office of State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez, who activists said had mishandled the prosecutions of both Van Dyke and Servin. In the wake of the protests, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, and the U.S. Department of Justice placed the CPD under a federal consent decree.Everything changed in 2020, as protests of the murder of George Floyd by then-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin swept the nation.\u00a0In Chicago and elsewhere, the rebellions (and the police response to them) turned into a long, hot summer. In its midst, the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression formed a coalition, Empowering Communities for Public Safety. With thousands of ordinary people at its back and in the streets, the coalition negotiated the language of the ECPS ordinance with the mayor. It passed in 2021.Chicagoans have been promised police reform before, and the department\u2019s entrenched attitude against change could make some wonder how effective the district councils will be. One clue to the power they may wield lies in who\u2019s on the ballot. In addition to ordinary residents and dedicated activists, several candidates with law enforcement ties are running. And the Fraternal Order of Police\u2019s election attorney filed challenges to several progressive candidates\u2019 ballot petitions, is listed as the contact person for six more on Chicago Board of Election Commissioners (CBEC) filings, and is himself running.\u00a0We\u00a0sent questionnaires to district council candidates, interviewed as many as we could reach, and researched their backgrounds using sources ranging from social media to biographies compiled by the ECPS coalition. We\u2019ve compiled the responses below.

  "title": "Despite judge\u2019s ruling, GKMC will continue its peacekeeping activity in Hyde Park for Halloween",
  "text": "Since 2018, the youth-led organization has hosted a peacekeeping and cop-watching activity on Halloween in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In their lawsuit filed on Oct. 26, GKMC argued that the citywide curfew prevents their members, majority of which are under age 18, from carrying out its Halloween activity.\u201cGKMC members fear that if they participate in these activities during curfew hours, CPD officers will subject them to arrest, harassment and/or police violence,\u201d the lawsuit stated.In 2018, CBS Chicago reported that at least 100 young people were out in Hyde Park on Halloween, vandalizing cars, harassing people attending a street festival and robbing University of Chicago students. Police said 11 juveniles and one adult were arrested for reckless conduct for an incident at 53rd and Lake Park that evening.Some of GKMC\u2019s peacekeeping work on Halloween includes mediating disputes between teens, facilitating peace circles, creating peaceful and positive spaces for youth on Halloween, cop watching and informing youth of their constitutional rights in case they are approached by police, according to court documents.\u201cWe talk to them and tell them who we are, what we represent, why we\u2019re here to support them, and how not to engage with the police,\u201d GKMC Miracle Boyd told The TRiiBE on Oct. 31, following U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis\u2019s ruling.\u00a0For instance, there may be young people out on Halloween who are unaware that there is a new city curfew in place, or who may be responsible for younger relatives who don\u2019t have an adult to accompany them.\u00a0 \u201cWe also tell them they don\u2019t have to engage the police and tell them where the activities will be happening, and if they need help, who to reach out to,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe give them information so that they can inform themselves when confronted by a police officer.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.On May 25, the Chicago City Council passed Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s ordinance to extend and expand a citywide curfew for youth, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and Brown children.\u00a0\u00a0Under the ordinance, curfew begins daily at 10:00 p.m. \u2014 instead of the previous 11:00 p.m. time. It also includes minors under age 18. Previously, the curfew applied to minors ages 12 through 16. For children ages 12 and younger, their curfew remained the same: 8:30 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and 9:00 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.\u00a0Curfew exceptions are granted to youth coming from ticketed or sponsored events. However, they must be able to show documentation of their attendance if asked by authorities.That same month, Lightfoot also issued an executive order at Millennium Park requiring visitors under 18 to be accompanied by an adult after 6:00 p.m. on Thursday through Sunday nights.A Block Club Chicago analysis of CPD data found that the city\u2019s youth curfew was mostly enforced on the South and West sides and had little effect on crime. Grand Central, the 25th Police District covering parts of the Northwest and West sides, recorded the most reports, with 28.In the Oct. 31 ruling, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis said there wasn\u2019t a need to issue a temporary restraining order for the city\u2019s youth curfew ordinance. However, she argued that GKMC\u2019s peacekeeping activities are protected under the first amendment, while attorneys representing the city in the lawsuit disagreed with that notion.\u00a0During the hearing, city attorney Bradley Wilson said that CPD officers in the second police district, Wentworth, have been advised to review the city\u2019s ordinance, along with a second order CPD Special Order S06-04-09, to ensure that de-escalation steps are employed before the curfew is enforced or any further action is taken.\u00a0In response to questions from The TRiiBE about department guidelines for de-escalation techniques as they encounter young people, and whether more officers will be deployed in the second district on Halloween, a CPD spokesperson said:\u201cThe Chicago Police Department regularly reviews and adjusts resources to ensure Districts across the city have sufficient staffing. We will have a comprehensive plan in place to maintain public safety citywide during Halloween,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in the email.\u00a0\u00a0According to the lawsuit, GKMC\u2019s presence on Halloween is considered a \u201cnon-traditional first amendment activity.\u201d Lawyers asked for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to keep Chicago Police Department (CPD) officers from enforcing the city\u2019s curfew against GKMC members and other young people who participate.Although the outcome was not what they desired, civil rights attorneys Sheila Bedi and Kara Cutcher said the Ellis\u2019 ruling affirms that peacekeeping is a protected first amendment activity. Both represented GKMC in the suit.\u00a0\u201cWhat was clear, though, is that the city was unwilling to concede that peacekeeping is a protected first amendment activity. And the court made it very clear that, in the court\u2019s view, peacekeeping is protected under the first amendment and that the city should be advising its officers not to enforce the curfew against young people who are engaging in acts of peacekeeping,\u201d Bedi told The TRiiBE. \u201cSo that was an important clarification that the city was unwilling to concede prior to this morning. The city was essentially saying the curfew was enough and that it\u2019s constitutional.\u201dBoyd estimates that hundreds of young people come to Hyde Park on Halloween to celebrate each year because it is an affluent community with neighbors who buy the best candy.\u00a0She added that the number of young people in Hyde Park on Halloween has decreased over the years because of the heavy police presence. According to the Hyde Park Herald, no one was arrested in Hyde Park on Halloween in 2020 and 2021. Various community groups, including GKMC, were present along 53rd Street for peacekeeping and copwatching in 2021, Hyde Park Herald reported.\u00a0\u201cKids just want to have a good time. Some neighbors in Hyde Park and the police militarize instead of providing activities for them to engage in. So that creates anticipation and anxiety,\u201d Boyd said.\u00a0"

  "title": "Will the 2023 municipal election push the Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus further left?",
  "text": "The Chicago Aldermanic Black Caucus (CABC) is changing. So far this year, a total of 15 City Council members have either stepped down, announced plans to retire, or launched campaigns to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot in the 2023 mayoral election. And one alder, Patrick Daley Thompson, was convicted of filing false income tax returns in February; another, Ed Burke, remains under federal indictment.\u00a0Of those 15 alders, six are members of the 20-person CABC, a group charged with \u201crepresenting the needs and interests of Chicago\u2019s Black communities,\u201d according to its website.Three Black alders \u2014 Carrie Austin (34th Ward), Leslie Hairston (5th Ward), and Howard Brookins (21st Ward) \u2014 will retire at the end of their terms. Hairston was elected in 1999 and Brookins in 2003. Austin, elected in 1994, is currently the longest-serving Black alder; additionally in 2021, a federal jury indicted Austin and her chief of staff on bribery charges for allegedly conspiring to receive home improvements for construction contractors that sought city assistance for a development project in her ward.\u00a0Two Black alders have thrown their hats in the mayoral race: Sophia King (4th Ward) and Roderick Sawyer (6th Ward). The latter is the son of Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed mayor after the sudden death of former Chicago mayor Harold Washington in 1987.Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th Ward) retired from the City Council in May after serving since 2015. Out of 19 vying for the seat, Lightfoot appointed his sister Monique Scott to take his place.\u00a0With Chicago\u2019s municipal election season now in full swing, the aldermanic shakeup comes as self-styled progressive alders appear ascendant in a City Council that is still finding its identity after decades of lockstep allegiance to Machine bosses in the mayor\u2019s office.Such unprecedented shifts could attract young Black Chicagoans \u2014 and others disillusioned with politics \u2014 to vote in the municipal election, which has experienced low voter turnouts in recent years. But whether that will prompt the CABC to become more independent or progressive as well is yet to be seen.\u201cIf you ask a person, a Black person in particular, what do you think we can do to improve public safety or how do you feel about people in your community having oversight over the police, most people would say that\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Greg Kelley, president of SEIU Healthcare Illinois Indiana Missouri & Kansas. The SEIU is a union representing healthcare, child care, home care and nursing home workers in the Midwest.\u201cThat\u2019s a progressive thing,\u201d Kelley added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it \u2018progressive\u2019 if I were talking to someone like my mother, for example.\u201dRepublicans and right-wing extremists have turned the word \u201cprogressive\u201d into a derogatory term, using it as a dog whistle to describe cities with democratic leaders like Chicago as \u201clawless.\u201d\u00a0\n        Coupled with sensationalized reporting and rhetoric that inaccurately paints Chicago as the \u201cmurder capital of the world,\u201d a fear-mongering misinformation campaign is easy to spread. The word, Kelley said, can elicit a certain reaction from older Black voters.\u201cI think we need to do a better job at explaining the issues and relying less on buzzwords like \u2018progressive.\u2019 This messaging isn\u2019t reaching certain folks and they may be resistant because they are unfamiliar with the terms,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo, our job is to communicate the issues without the labels.\u201dThe TRiiBE reached out to Black political experts, City Council members, organizers and labor leaders to weigh in on what a shift in City Council could mean for Black Chicagoans.The consensus from the group is that candidates and leaders must not only be progressive in name, but also in action.Think back to the administrations of former mayors Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel. During each of those administrations, the CABC voted for controversial initiatives supported by the respective mayors, including Daley\u2019s 75-year parking deal and Emanuel\u2019s closure of half the city\u2019s public mental health clinics and plans for a cop academy.\u00a0During Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s first term, the CABC has largely voted in agreement with her, 89 percent of the time, according to an analysis from the University of Illinois at Chicago\u2019s political department\u2019s Chicago City Council report.\u00a0Those decisions have had long-lasting impacts on Black communities. For example, Black youth organizers with the #NoCopAcademy campaign pushed back against Emanuel\u2019s $95 million cop academy for Chicago police in West Garfield Park because investing more in the police would mean more violence for Black and brown communities. Instead, they demanded through their grassroots campaign that the city fund and provide resources for schools and youth.\u00a0City Council voted 38-8 in favor of the cop academy in March 2019. In September 2022, Lightfoot\u2019s administration asked for an additional $20 million for phase two of the cop academy, raising the cost for the cop academy to $128 million.\u201cThat was a campaign largely driven by young Black people,\u201d Kennedy Bartley told The TRiiBE. She is one of the lead organizers for the #DefundCPD Campaign and director of campaigns at the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cSo, I think as far back as I can remember, but also as recently as the cop academy, as budget votes continue to increase police budgets and fund Black communities and Latinx communities and poor communities at abysmal rates, the Black Caucus has historically taken violent votes,\u201d she added.The term progressive has become a buzzword in recent years and election cycles \u2014 so much so that Mayor Lori Lightfoot co-opted the language and concerns of young Black and queer organizers to aid her run for mayor in 2019.\n        As more than 50 vacant lots in Woodlawn are redeveloped, 30 percent of the units will be reserved for \u201cvery low-income\u201d renters.Although the term dates back to the 1900s, according to NPR, the 2016 presidential campaign of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders breathed new life into it. \u201cProgressivism is now a way for politicians to appeal to far left-leaning Americans, without alienating moderates and independents who reject the \u201cliberal\u201d label,\u201d NPR reported.In 2019, a slate of progressive candidates joined the City Council. Longtime South Side organizer Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th Ward) won a runoff race, succeeding former 20th Ward alderperson Willie Cochran. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Cochran on charges that he allegedly took money from a charitable fund that was intended to help families and children in his ward, according to the Department of Justice.Before becoming an alderperson, Taylor served as an organizer with the Kenwood Oakland Community Organization and was a leading organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition.\u00a0There\u2019s also former BYP100 board member Maria Hadden, who beat longtime 49th Ward incumbent Joe Moore, ending his 28-year career on the City Council. Moore identified as a progressive, but according to a Block Club Chicago article, he voted more than 98 percent of the time with Emanuel.\u00a0Not only did Hadden become the first openly queer Black woman elected to Chicago City Council, but she also became the first Black alderperson to be elected to a North Side Ward.\u00a0And there\u2019s Matt Martin, who was elected to the 47th Ward in 2019. Before joining the City Council, he served as a civil rights attorney in the Illinois Attorney General Office. He focused on issues including police reform, worker\u2019s rights, healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive rights. He also helped to write the consent decree.\u00a0Along with Taylor, Hadden and Martin serve on the CABC and the Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus (CCCPRC).\u00a0Then there\u2019s Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd Ward), a former community organizer who beat incumbent Deb Mell in the 2019 runoff. Mell was appointed to City Council in 2013 to replace her father, who had served on City Council since 1975. Rodriguez-Sanchez is a member of the CCCPRC and Chicago City Council Latino Caucus.\u00a0Taylor, Rodriguez-Sanchez and Hadden\u2019s roots in activism have kept them connected to the needs of their constituents.Recent progressive policies that passed through City Council include the\u00a0Fight for $15 minimum wage campaign\u00a0in November 2019, the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance in September 2020 and the Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) ordinance\u00a0in July 2021.Beginning in 2016, members of the CBA coalition \u2014 which Ald. Taylor had been a part of \u2014 came together to protect residents in Woodlawn and neighboring communities from displacement due to the development of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park. Those efforts came to fruition in 2020, when the City Council approved the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Taylor co-sponsored. One of the ordinance\u2019s key features is a requirement that for each redevelopment of 52 vacant city-owned lots, at least 30 percent of new apartments must be made affordable to \u201cvery low-income households.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the representation that goes beyond the identity of Blackness and represents the class interests and the social interests of Black folks in the city,\u201d\u00a0Bartley said. \u201cI think it\u2019s about getting organizers into office.\u201dWith these new voices in office, Bartley said then we can find ways to meaningfully challenge the alders who have been in power for years.\u00a0\u201cWe know that Black voters are loyal voters,\u201d she said. \u201cHow are we providing material alternatives to the folks in our communities and neighborhoods and then organizing them to believe in bolder representation?\u201dFor Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates, the mayor is an important part of the equation, too. Since the mayor sits atop the city\u2019s governmental power structure, some alders acquiesce to that power, she said.\u00a0\u201cIf Black people want to be accommodated in the city, they\u2019re going to have to be accommodated by a progressive mayor because that is the type of mayor who\u2019s going to fully fund schools,\u201d Gates told The TRiiBE. \u201cThat is the type of mayor that will go into neighborhoods like Chatham and make sure that it continues to be a place for the working class and the middle class. You need mayors to lead.\u201d\n        Heightened enforcement to reduce crime in Chicago usually comes with coded, anti-Black language that, if violated, puts more of us in jail.She pointed to the success of Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, and the causes he championed and enacted once he took office in 1983. As mayor, he opened the city\u2019s budget process up for public input, fought to redistrict wards which provided more Black and Latinx representation, and created the Ethics Commission to check the power of the city\u2019s administration.\u201cThe greatest amount of transformation for Black people in the city did not come from a Black Caucus,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt came from a Black mayor through a movement of people who wanted more for all people in this city. But it was anchored in the hopes and dreams of the migrants from Mississippi.\u201dMayor Lightfoot led a proposal to sue gang members for their assets, despite criticism from the legal community who said the ordinance, if passed, would fail to reduce gun violence, seize money, property, and other assets from vulnerable people not even alleged to have participated in violence, such as parents, grandparents and other family members. Six Black alders voted in agreement with her: Jason Ervin (28th Ward), Derrick Curtis (18th Ward), Greg Mitchell (7th Ward), Emma Mitts (37th Ward), Scott and Christopher Taliaferro (29th Ward), who serve on the City Council\u2019s public safety committee. Lightfoot delayed a final vote on that ordinance in February.\u00a0When Mayor Lightfoot proposed to extend and expand the citywide curfew for youth following the shooting of a 16-year-old teenager in Millennium Park, despite critics saying the measure would disproportionately harm Black and brown youth, 10 CABC members voted in favor of it: Mitchell, Michelle Harris (8th Ward), Curtis, Brookins, Scott, Walter Burnett (27th Ward), Ervin, Taliaferro, Austin and Mitts.\u00a0For politicians, merely identifying as a progressive candidate is not enough. Bartley said the words, actions and policymaking decisions must match, and voters must demand more and be clear about what they\u2019re asking of their elected representatives.\u00a0For Kelley, progressivism, as it relates to politics and legislation, includes policymaking that addresses the needs of everyday working people.\u00a0There\u2019s a widely held belief that Millennials and Generation Z only mobilize on issues by leading demonstrations or protests. While some applaud their efforts, they are often criticized because they aren\u2019t appearing en masse to vote in elections.\u00a0More than 520,000 people voted in the general municipal election in February 2019; of that total, approximately 3.5 percent were between the ages of 18 to 24, 15 percent were between the ages of 25 to 34 and 17 percent were between the ages of 35 to 44.\u00a0Overall, voter turnout was 35 percent in the general municipal election and 33 percent for the runoff election in April 2019.\u00a0TRiiBE contributor Charles Preston wrote a 2019 opinion piece responding to criticism about millennial voter turnout. He noted that organizing and demonstrations led by young Black people did lead to wins for the movement and Chicagoans during the previous municipal election cycle.\u00a0\u201cMany activists who stood in front of Lori Lightfoot and Garry McCarthy at past Chicago Police Department Board hearings are now witnessing those very candidates reiterate (some would say co-opt) their talking points! The call for more mental health clinics, an elected school board, and defunding police in favor of more community-based programs is not an original thought by candidates. This is the result of the incredibly penetrating and revolutionary action by youth,\u201d Preston wrote.In order to attract new potential voters, lawmakers must have messaging and communication about progressive policies that are digestible for all constituents across ages and backgrounds.\u00a0Although Brookins believes there is an opportunity to push Black people further left, he said many Black voters identify as democrats while still supporting some conservative-leaning policies.\u201cMy elections have shown that African Americans are, by nature, conservative, especially the older African Americans who are the bread-and-butter people that go out and vote,\u201d Brookins told The TRiiBE on Sept. 8.Earlier that day, Brookins endorsed South Side native and community organizer Ronnie Mosley\u2019s campaign to replace him in the 21st Ward. In 2017, Mosley co-founded Homegrown Strategy Group, a policy and organizing firm that believes in community power and the idea that achievement comes through collective effort.\u201cWith that said, there is room for a shift in liberal ideas, especially when it comes to things like policing, which I\u2019ve been at the forefront of,\u201d Brookins continued.\u00a0He was one of the sponsors of the reparations ordinance for victims of disgraced Chicago Police Department Cmdr. Jon Burge. The measure was introduced in 2013 and was approved in 2015.\u00a0However, Brookins also voted in support of the cop academy in 2019.\u201cBut I still believe there\u2019s a strong contingency of people who believe that we should pull ourselves up by the bootstraps, live a law-and-order-type life, and so forth. But there\u2019s room to gently push people, not necessarily jerk them to the left,\u201d Brookins added.When candidates claim to be progressive, Bartley said we must ask them about their commitment to issues like affordable housing, mental health and funding for education. And, once elected, it\u2019s up to constituents to hold them accountable.\u00a0"

  "text": "\u201cHe was everything to us. He was a good son, a good brother and a good boyfriend. Myron was a good kid,\u201d his mother, Carmela Richardson, told The TRiiBE on Aug. 5.\u00a0It\u2019s also been two years since 30-year-old Tiara Taylor was shot and killed in her home. No one has been charged with her murder.\u00a0\u201cShe was a wonderful mother. She was a wonderful daughter, a sister. She had a loving and caring heart. She would go out of her way and beyond for people,\u201d Felicia Guilty said while describing her daughter Taylor, who was killed in July 2020.Richardson and Guilty are still on the quest for justice for their children, as are the families of countless gun violence victims in Chicago. For both mothers, justice looks like criminal charges being brought against the people who murdered their children.On Aug. 5, both mothers joined five other families during a press conference staged at the Daley Center across the street from the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office (CCSAO), urging Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx and CCSAO prosecutors to reexamine cases involving their loved ones. They\u2019re asking the CCSAO to pursue additional charges in cases as needed, and to respond to phone calls from the families of gun violence victims.\u00a0Organized by community activist Andrew Holmes, the intended goal of the event was to \u201cexpress concern over the lack of impunity criminals have and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office who stands behind them,\u201d according to a written release.\u00a0Holmes, disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich and \u201cCase Files Chicago\u201d TV producer Lisette Guillen did express their concerns with their remarks after repeatedly mentioning Foxx\u2019s name. However, all three reiterated during the press conference that the goal was not to bash the state\u2019s attorney.\u201cThese families are not seeking vengeance. They\u2019re seeking justice and they deserve closure. We\u2019re here today to support them. And as Andrew Holmes said, not to criticize, or I should say, not to bash State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx. I believe the State\u2019s Attorney Office and Cook County can do a better job at prosecuting cases, particularly those involving violent criminals,\u201d Blagojevich said.\u00a0They also wondered aloud about what resources or support could be offered to help the CCSAO and whether that support should come from the Chicago Police Department (CPD) or Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration, because \u201csomewhere in this [SAO] office, there\u2019s a loophole,\u201d Holmes said.The people committing gun crimes in Chicago are walking away without being charged, leading them to inflict further violence in communities, Holmes added.\u201cAnd if we need to help her get this caseload right, get these state\u2019s attorneys on board and stop letting these offenders out, then so be it. That\u2019s what we need to do. But we\u2019re not bashing Kim Foxx, for the fifth and sixth time. We\u2019re finding out where she needs help to prosecute these individuals,\u201d Holmes said.\u00a0Holmes, Blagojevich, Guillen and the families at the press conference laid the blame squarely on Foxx\u2019s shoulders, believing that she and the CCSAO hold all the power in bringing down justice.\u00a0But what\u2019s missing from this conversation \u2014 along with many other conversations criticizing the work of progressive prosecutors nationwide \u2014\u00a0 is the recognition that the SAO is a part of a much-larger ecosystem. That ecosystem includes judges, who are solely responsible for setting bail, and police, who are responsible for gathering and presenting sound evidence to the SAO that supports filing appropriate charges.\u201cWhere is due process?\u201d CPD torture survivor Mark Clements asked during the press conference. At age 16, Clements was sentenced to life in prison for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. He was incarcerated for 28 years before his conviction was overturned in 2009.\u00a0\u201cMr. Governor [Blagojevich], when you were in office, you had tons of executive clemency [requests] which you ignored,\u201d Clements said, referencing the 1,160 clemency requests that Blagojevich denied between 2003 and 2008. The former governor, whose 14-year prison sentence was commuted by former President Donald Trump in 2020, only pardoned 67 people, according to a Chicago Tribune report.\u00a0Blagojevich said he agreed with what Clements said about due process.\u00a0However, he added, \u201cmany of these guys who are charged with violent crimes, in fact, did. And so the question is whether or not we err on the side of public safety and keep them locked up until the courts can decide whether they did it or didn\u2019t do it. Or we let them out.\u201dIn 2020, Gov. J.B. Pritzker commuted 49 prison sentences, 22 in 2021 and none so far in 2022, according to WBEZ. Foxx has granted 229 exonerations since taking office in 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, Clements is an organizer with the Chicago Torture Justice Center, which seeks to address the traumas of police violence and institutionalized racism through access to healing and wellness services, trauma-informed resources and community connection.\u00a0\u201cWhat have we seen in the [disgraced CPD Det. Reynaldo] Guevara scandal? Eight exonerations in less than 10 days last week,\u201d Clements said, referencing Foxx\u2019s move to ask judges to vacate eight murder convictions that were tied to Guevara on Aug. 9.\u00a0As a result, two people in custody were released, while five completed their prison sentences and are no longer in custody. According to a written release from the SAO, one person remains in custody pending further court proceedings. Guevara has been under investigation for torture and submitting false confessions and evidence dating back to the 1980s and 1990s.\u201cAnd you know what? Guess what? They were innocent. This is going to cost taxpayers. This is wrong,\u201d Clements said. \u201cMy heart bleeds for all of these people here. But let\u2019s keep it real. This is an attack by the FOP [Fraternal Order of Police].\u201dWho is to blame for the rise in violent crime?The rhetoric shared at the Aug. 5 press conference by those seven family members, Holmes, Blagojevich and Guillen points to an ongoing larger national issue: conservative-minded leaders and mainstream news headlines perpetuating the myth that criminal justice and bail reform is driving the increase in violent crime.\u201cIt makes no sense to allow someone charged with murder, attempted murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and carjacking, and let them out on bond,\u201d Blagojevich said at the presser on Aug. 5. He served as Illinois governor from 2003 until he was impeached and removed from office in 2009 following his arrest on federal corruption charges.\u00a0\u201cNow there\u2019s a good chance that some of them may be innocent. The law says they\u2019re presumed to be innocent,\u201d Blagojevich continued. \u201cYet the statistics tell us they\u2019re guilty in most of those cases.\u201dBlagojevich used rhetoric that served as a back-handed attack against the work of progressive prosecutors like Foxx, who are actively working on criminal justice and bail reform.Cook County Circuit Court Chief Judge Timothy Evans has released quarterly bond court reports since he implemented General Order 18.8A in September 2017 to reform bail practices in Cook County. The order mandates that judges make any monetary bonds required for release affordable to the individual, creating procedural precautions to help ensure that no person is held in custody pretrial solely because they cannot afford to post bail. Judges determine and set bail. The CCSAO does not.\u00a0The Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data from October 2017 to March 2022 shows 3.4% of felony defendants and 5.1% of non-violent misdemeanor defendants were charged with a new crime while on pretrial release.\n        In part one of our interview with Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx, columnist Bella BAHHS calls the steps that Foxx has taken to downsize the footprint of prosecution and reduce the county\u2019s incarcerated population \u201ccommendable.\u201dClements expressed his support for the victims and families present, but added that the press conference was an attack on Foxx. He argued that the blame for not holding people who commit crimes accountable doesn\u2019t rest on Foxx.\u00a0\u201cFoxx is doing the best that she can do,\u201d Clements told The TRiiBE. In a November 2021 one-on-one interview with Foxx for \u201cThe Revolutionary Column,\u201d she shared that her office vacated 114 convictions tied to Ronald Watts, a former CPD sergeant who ran a criminal enterprise within the department with a crew of crooked cops who terrorized the residents of the Ida B. Wells housing projects in Bronzeville. In 2013, he was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\u201cFoxx has given us some form of credibility within the criminal justice system, but due to the fact that it has layers and layers of corruption, it\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Clements added.On Aug. 12, The TRiiBE reached out to Foxx again to unpack the mistrust that lies between the SAO\u2019s office and victims\u2019 families.\u00a0 Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak about specific cases that remain under investigation, she addressed why there\u2019s a national perception that people on pretrial release are driving the increase in violent crime.\u00a0\u201cI think Chief Judge Evans and the data have shown about 5% of those folks come back with a [new] crime of violence. You need to tell that story, because what it means is 95%, the overwhelming majority of people who are out on bond pretrial, do not pick up a violent offense,\u201d Foxx said, referencing the Cook County Circuit Court\u2019s bond court data. \u201cI\u2019m heartened [by] efforts from, like, the Lawndale Christian Legal Center, around wrap-around services for people who are out on bail, because I think it\u2019s long overdue. We need to wrap those folks in as many services as we can to prevent them from engaging in that behavior.\u201dAccording to Illinois Justice Criminal Authority research, the outcomes for people held in jail pretrial are worse than for those out on pretrial release, Foxx said. For example, people detained pretrial could risk losing their employment or housing. If they are parents or caregivers and detained pretrial, that means they\u2019d have to find alternative childcare or risk losing their children. Foxx said some of those children end up in the Department of Children and Family Services.\u201cAll of these people, whether detained or released, are presumed innocent until they are found guilty by a judge or jury,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cSo these determinations of who stays in custody, knowing what these outcomes are, are really important, and why we have to be thoughtful around those conversations, and why we cannot afford to let misinformation rhetoric guide that conversation, because it will ultimately hurt predominantly Black defendants in the long run.\u201dThe quest for justice\u00a0Richardson and Guilty have not given up hope. Both mothers are committed to seeking justice for their children and other families who\u2019ve lost loved ones to gun violence in Chicago.\u00a0In a follow-up interview with The TRiiBE on Aug. 5, Richardson shared that there is a person in custody related to her son Myron\u2019s case, but the suspect, Darius Dawson, has only been charged with concealment of a homicide.\u00a0Richardson, however, wants to see a murder charge filed against the person who killed her son.\u201cAre y\u2019all still out there investigating? Are y\u2019all still looking for new evidence? I need to know that verbally. Is there a chance that he\u2019s going to be charged with murder?\u201d Richardson asked during her interview with The TRiiBE. \u201cI need to know these things, and those are the questions that have not been answered.\u201d\u00a0Richardson fears Dawson will go free without additional charges such as arson, murder or obstruction of justice. Additionally, she alleges that other witnesses may have been involved in her son\u2019s murder and they should also be charged by county prosecutors.\u00a0\u201cThe charge that they [the SAO] charged him with only holds 30 months probation. So at this time, if we go to trial, he can plead guilty to that, and then he\u2019s going to be done with my son\u2019s case because he has been locked up for eight months now,\u201d Richardson explained.\u00a0Concealment of a homicide is a class three felony offense. The sentencing range for a conviction is probation or up to five years in prison, a CCSAO spokesperson wrote in an email to The TRiiBE on Aug. 17.\u00a0Dawson pled not guilty during an arraignment hearing on Jan. 14, 2022. His next court date is scheduled for Sept. 12.\u00a0Although Foxx couldn\u2019t speak to specific cases, she reiterated how essential it is for her office to examine the facts of a case, any evidence involved in a case, and the law when reviewing cases. All of these factors determine whether the SAO should file charges and, if so, what type of charges to file. The CCSAO\u2019s felony review unit looks at the facts and evidence in every case to make a determination on whether there\u2019s enough information and evidence to support filing a charge.\n        By keeping her 2016 campaign promises, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s interventions are getting us closer to the possibility of abolition than any other prosecutor who previously sat in her chair.However, Foxx said, there are times when the SAO cannot file charges because they lack sufficient evidence to support it.\u00a0In those instances, the case transitions back to the police department as a continuing investigation. Then the police are responsible for securing more information and evidence; that could be more witnesses, more forensic testing or more gunshot residue, depending on the type of case it is, Foxx explained.\u201cThe unfortunate reality of doing this work is that justice often feels elusive when we\u2019re unable to charge cases. But I absolutely have an obligation only to bring charges when the facts, the evidence and the law support it,\u201d Foxx said.\u00a0The family of Tiara Taylor also expressed frustration with the way Foxx and the SAO are handling her case. Taylor\u2019s mother and sister Kiara Newsome said they don\u2019t support Foxx. They also feel they haven\u2019t received enough communication from the SAO about Taylor\u2019s case.\u00a0\u201cMy sister was killed inside her home by her husband, and Kim Foxx had the person who did it, and they let him go. Because he said it was an accident. How can you kill somebody by accident?\u201d Newsome asked.\u00a0According to an ABC7 Chicago news report, Taylor\u2019s husband, Jarod Wallace, told police they had an argument and fought over a gun. He told police that Taylor shot herself. CPD officers took Wallace into custody, but he was not charged by the SAO.\u00a0\u201cHe is walking free with no background or anything, and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Newsome added.Guilty said the SAO\u2019s office declined to file charges in her daughter\u2019s case. In her interview with The TRiiBE, she said state prosecutors told her they didn\u2019t want to proceed with charges because her daughter may have been the aggressor.\u00a0Guilty said investigators questioned Taylor\u2019s 11-year-old son, who was home when his mother was shot.\u00a0\u201cThey didn\u2019t go over her case. They didn\u2019t even investigate. They didn\u2019t come talk to us. They said nothing to us. I called the detectives every day. I called the state\u2019s attorney. I called everybody, trying to get in touch with somebody,\u201d Guilty said. \u201cThen, when I got in touch with them, I don\u2019t think they did their job. They didn\u2019t do their job at all. They didn\u2019t do the job because they didn\u2019t come and talk to none of her family.\u201dThe Cook County SAO has a unit called Victim Witness Assistance. It was created in 1981 and is a prosecutor-based victim service unit. The unit is mandated by the Illinois Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and it ensures that victims and witnesses receive timely information about court proceedings and referrals for social services.\u00a0Foxx told The TRiiBE that there are about 75 people working in the unit at the CCSAO. Some families have cases where they want the CCSAO to file charges, but sometimes the office declines to do so because it doesn\u2019t have sufficient evidence to support charges.\u00a0\u201cVictim Witness [Assistance] may be involved at the review stage of the case, but if a case is not filed in court then, traditionally, our victim witness folks are no longer working with those families,\u201d Foxx explained.For cases still being investigated by law enforcement, Foxx said the investigating law enforcement agency is the point of contact for victims, victims\u2019 families and witnesses. The SAO\u2019s office, she explained, is generally not involved until a charging decision has been made by the SAO\u2019s office or there\u2019s a request from authorities for the office to file additional charges.\u00a0"
