  "text": "Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st, left) and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul VallasReporterCook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st, left) and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul VallasCook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st), the second-place finisher in the first round of the 2023 Chicago mayoral election, won a third of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood, while outgoing incumbent Lori Lightfoot won more than a quarter of the local vote.Those margins exceed their citywide tallies, Johnson at around 20% and Lightfoot\u2019s 17%. Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

She is the first incumbent mayor to lose in Chicago since 1983. Four years ago, Hyde Park was the only community area she lost to her runoff opponent, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.The two local candidates, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald.

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

University Ave., in October 2015State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S.

Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.In October, Chicago Police Department officer who had been investigated for affiliating with the white nationalist Proud Boys organization was found to have given false statements about it and given a 120-day suspension.A reporter subsequently asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot about why the department had not fired an officer affiliated with the far-right, anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic organization that participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol; Lightfoot said that characterization was overstated.Two years ago today a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to take down democracy. This mob included the Proud Boys \u2014 an extremist group Mayor Lightfoot excused in October when she said it was an \u2018overstatement\u2019 to call them anti-Semitic and anti-gay, and defended the Chicago Police Department\u2019s decision not to fire an officer with known links to the Proud Boys.Mayor Lightfoot cannot even say once what I\u2019ve said multiple times since that moment in October: Proud Boys have no place in our police department. Period.Public trust in the police is at an all-time low, and it\u2019s a slap in the face to every CPD officer dedicated to constitutional policing to have a mayor who defends Proud Boys\u2019 racism.There\u2019s a clear difference between Mayor Lightfoot and me: She defends the indefensible while I\u2019m inclined to action. But today is the perfect time for her to right her wrong and apologize for brushing off the very real danger of far-right extremists infiltrating the ranks of those who are meant to keep us safe.Buckner, a local state representative since 2019, is running for mayor.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Left to right: county Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her wife, First Lady Amy Eshleman, at the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence in Hyde Park on Sunday at Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave.ReporterLeft to right: county Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her wife, First Lady Amy Eshleman, at the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence in Hyde Park on Sunday at Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave.Mayor Lori Lightfoot endorsed the effort underway by some Democrats in the state legislature to ban assault weapons in Illinois at a Sunday night vigil for victims and survivors of gun violence at Augustana Lutheran Church.All local state legislators and Gov. J.B. Pritzker support banning the weapons in Illinois. A House committee held a meeting on Monday on a bill by Rep. Bob Morgan (D-58th) \u2014 whose district includes North Shore suburb Highland Park, where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens more at a 4th of July parade with an AR-15-style semi automatic rifle \u2014 to ban assault weapons and other high caliber weapons. Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) is co-sponsoring that bill.\"As we solemnly recognize the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy, this is our opportunity,\" she said, noting the 1 million Americans who have been killed or wounded by gunfire in the decade since the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. \"This of course is an absurdity that in this country, with all our wealth, with our economy, that we can't solve this problem that plagues every community in our nation.\"She teased a city pilot program to provide more support to gun violence survivors in addition to banning assault weapons, saying it's about accountability and \"making sure that we're doing everything possible to make our communities safe.\"The Illinois General Assembly is considering a bill to ban assault rifles statewide in its January lame duck session. In a Monday interview after a state House committee's subject matter hearing on the topic, Buckner noted the Sept. 13 mass shooting in Washington Park that killed two and wounded seven more. No assault rifles were used then, and Buckner said discussions at the meeting included what to do about handguns modified with \u201cswitches\u201d to function like automatic weapons.Those are already largely illegal in Illinois, though criminals are altering those guns at home, often with parts bought online. Buckner got legislation passed earlier this year banning \"ghost guns,\" unserialized weapons often sold as a kit for at-home construction.\u00a0\"I don't know if that's going to actually make its way into this bill, but I think for communities where violence has plagued us for a very long time, that is a pertinent conversation that people are starting to bring up,\" Buckner said. \"I think we're a way's off from what the final piece of legislation will look like. We've got a chance for some amendments, fixes and some things that will make it more palatable to folks, and more effective. But I think that the appetite is definitely there.\"Buckner said he thinks legislation against gun switches would help, but he said he wants to have more conversations with violence-interruptors and law enforcement about how such a ban would work in practice.State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) spoke of the exhaustion that he and other advocates and policymakers face after years of mass shootings that make national news and \"shooting on the streets due to gang violence.\"\"We've been advocating the same solutions over and over and over again,\" he said. \"I'm tired of the fact that our approach to gun violence is to point at the community. Interpersonal violence is of itself a problem, but it is not the only problem,\" he said. \"Every time a bullet hits somebody, that is somebody's stock price going up. Every time there's a mass shooting, you look at Wall Street, and an investor is making a buck. It keeps happening, and those same people, those same investors, tell us, 'It's an individual's fault. It's your community's fault.'\"There is a clear correlation between mass shooting events and spikes in gunmakers' share prices. Peters said assault weapon bans would \"go after the fault of the problem: there are people making money hand-over-fist in this country when it comes to gun violence.\"Peters also said public safety means access to education, jobs, housing and transportation, not lock-them-up carceral policies. He praised anti-violence legislation in Illinois, which funds third-party programming in youth intervention services, violence interruption and trauma treatment. And he praised the University of Chicago Medical Center's new legal services for trauma victims (see story on page 7), saying more initiatives like that are necessary.The Rev. Nancy Goede, pastor of Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave., hosted the vigil. Her local colleagues Rabbi David Minkus of Congregation Rodfei Zedek, 5200 S. Hyde Park Blvd., and the Rev. Veroica Johnson of Hyde Park Union Church, 5600 S. Woodlawn Ave., who chairs the Interfaith Anti Violence Task Force of Hyde Park-Kenwood, also spoke.Johnson prayed to comfort victims' families, friends and communities. \"Unless we lament, which simply means 'cry out honestly about our pain,' we run the risk of normalizing this violence. We run the risk of getting numb by it and not getting moved by it,\" she said.\"Refuse to be silent,\" she said. \"Refuse to be silent about your loved ones. Refuse to be silent about guns. Refuse to be silent about all the causes of violence, including the historical lack of investment in our communities and young people. Cry out from your souls, and refuse to be silent.\"Chicago Survivors, which helps families affected by gun violence, organized the event. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Cook County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) and representatives from anti-violence and grief support organizations also spoke.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"ReporterRep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) has released a list of environmental goals for his mayoral administration should voters elect him next year, with a focus on environmental justice, sustainability and collaborative work and financing with the state and federal governments.\"Chicago has a real chance to get this right, to be the tip of the spear and lead the country in what a clean, green, sustainable, environmentally just big city looks like,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0Should he be elected, he would establish a staffed Department of Environment to create a comprehensive plan to address environmental threats to the city and a hundred-day Climate Blueprint Plan to target emission reductions and decrease consumption of fossil fuels. He said he would work with the county on efforts to finance cheap energy efficiency at a property level.\u00a0Buckner added that he would reconfigure the industrial zoning process to \"ensure no community is unnecessarily burdened.\"\"We know that, for a very long time, Chicago was \u2018the industrial city.\u2019 So we still have the remnants of being that industrial city here,\" he said. \"We have recycling and metal shredders and folks who are 'toxic polluters' who are very often situated in these sacrifice zones, specifically in places like the Southeast Side of Chicago, but there has been a big threat of this in places like Pilsen as well.Buckner also pointed to the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act that passed in 2021, which provides billions of dollars in funding for energy transition by shifting away from coal power to renewables and installing green workforces and infrastructure like electric vehicle purchases and chargers. He said the city will miss out on resources and momentum like this if it doesn't attach itself to recent state policymaking.\u00a0\"I think the city has operated in a piecemeal fashion when it comes to resources for environmental justice and sustainability, and part of that is because there is no Department of Environment in City Hall anymore,\" he said.\"The city not having the ability to coordinate with the Illinois (Environmental Protection Agency) on who gets permits, what those look like, who, more importantly, doesn't get a permit and how we do remediation, how we're sure that we're following the data on what's happening in these communities. That's been a huge deficit in this administration, and that will change immediately once we stand up a Department of Environment and give them the resources to actually do their job,\" he said.In addition to plans to reach 100% renewable energy by 2035, he wants to change out lead service lines by splitting the city into priority zones for the work, saying the city is unsystematically doing so now. In September, WTTW reported that the city has only replaced 0.5% of eligible lead pipes.\u00a0There are federal dollars to do this through the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan signed into law last year. \"There is a lot of money that's available at the U.S. (Environmental Protection Agency) level that's going to be able to come down to municipalities across the country,\" Buckner said.\u00a0To control flooding, a problem getting worse even along Lake Michigan\u2019s shores as climate change accelerates, Buckner would work with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to develop an alternative solution to the city's current combined sewer system, in which wastewater and stormwater combine into the same pipes, which has resulted in sanitary waste pollution during deluges. He would like to install infrastructure like permeable pavement that allows rainfall and snowmelt to seep into covered ground.He supports preserving Promontory Point's limestone revetment as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other entities begin work to buttress the peninsula park. He said he has been aware of the park\u2019s erosion issue since he worked on U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) staff 15 years ago.\u00a0\"After conversations with neighbors, advocates and folks who do this work for a living, it's important to me that we take a preservationist approach to this, to make sure that we're preserving, getting this right and not putting ourselves in a worse position,\" Buckner said.There is also federal infrastructure money available for urban open spaces, lead pipe replacement and a number of other green issues. The problem, Buckner charged, is that the city is not going to Washington with cohesive plans for green investments.\u00a0\"Coordination is key in many ways when we talk about real sustainability, real environmental justice, protecting our waterways, our systems and our lakefront as well.\"It's that collaborationist impulse that Buckner says positions him to be a good executive as mayor.\"What Chicago really is asking for right now is leadership and vision that can bring people together, and that's something that this mayor has proven that she is not able or willing to do,\" he said. \"My track record as a public official in Springfield has been one of finding a way to solutions, finding a way to 'yes' instead of getting stuck at 'no.'\"He pointed to his ability to bring the American Civil Liberties Union and the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the banking lobby to support the organized retail crime bill that aims to prevent \u201csmash-and-grabs\u201d by improving prosecutorial abilities against the crimes\u2019 organizers. \"The leadership came to me to figure out how to do that, and I got it done,\" said Buckner.He pointed to his negotiations with labor, environmentalists and utility companies over the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.\"People want a mayor to be fighting for them, and it's not always about 'compromise' \u2014 it's about finding a way to get to the right answer. But I'm the first legislator in the Midwest to take on the gun lobby and win,\" he said, pointing to his legislation that bans unserialized \"ghost guns\" in Illinois.\u00a0\"Not only do I have the ability to fight, but I have the ability to bring folks together and find a solution, which has eluded this mayor in her last three and a half years in office,\" Buckner said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.Mayoral candidate Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner unveils plan for Chicago Public Schools outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Preckwinkle's communications director, Nick Shields, is at center.ReporterAn image from the Smith & Wesson website shows the type of weapon used in the July 4 Highland Park shooting.In the wake of a July 4 mass shooting in Highland Park that left seven people dead and dozens more injured, Gov. J.B. Pritzker is calling for a ban at both the state and national levels on military-style assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. The mid-South Side\u2019s state senators and representatives are joining these calls.\u201cWhile I support an assault weapon and high-capacity magazine ban at the state level, we urgently need federal regulation on the weapons of war and high-capacity magazines that are used only for mass murder,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement released last week. \u201cIllinois is not an island, and even with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, our state is only as safe as the state with the weakest laws \u2014 many of which border Illinois.\u201d\u00a0The weapon used in the Highland Park shooting has been identified as a Smith and Wesson M&P 15, a semi-automatic rifle that holds 30-round magazines of 5.56mm ammunition. The alleged shooter, Robert Crimo III, reportedly used three such magazines during his attack on a Fourth of July parade, firing off more than 80 bullets in a matter of just a few minutes.\u00a0The letters \u201cM&P\u201d stand for \u201cMilitary & Police,\u201d though it and others like it are widely available to civilians at sporting goods stores throughout the country.\u00a0The weapon used in Highland Park is also similar to guns used in other recent mass shootings, including the May 24 shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two teachers dead, and the May 14 shooting at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store that killed 10 people.\u00a0All those weapons are modeled after the Colt AR-15, a semi-automatic version of a rifle originally designed for military use.\u00a0On July 11, Pritzker and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering were at the White House for an event with President Joe Biden marking the recent signing of the Safer Communities Act, the first significant federal law addressing gun violence in nearly 30 years. Laws created by the act include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, more funding for crisis intervention programs and further criminalization for arms trafficking.\u201cWe had a number of conversations immediately after the attack in Highland Park and I've been impressed with the way they've handled things. It's been extraordinary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd as the three of us have discussed, we have more to do.\u201d\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle also attended the bill-signing.President Joe Biden (left) and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle (right) pose at the White House on Monday, July 11. Preckwinkle's communications director, Nick Shields, is at center.Later that day, Pritzker appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and he repeated calls for additional measures to control gun violence, such as banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines .\u00a0The mid-South Side\u2019s state senators are in agreement about banning assault rifles, and the area\u2019s state legislators all said they want to pursue gun control legislation, but it is unclear when the General Assembly will reconvene before its scheduled date.Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) listed six pieces of legislation the Illinois General Assembly could act on, adding that more \u201cis being proposed, contemplated and discussed\u201d:\u00a0House Bill 5522 would make it a felony to buy or sell assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, additionally requiring existing owners of such weapons to register them with the Illinois State Police and prohibiting those owners from selling them in-state to anyone but a federally licensed firearms dealer. Robinson and Reps. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) are sponsoring it.\u00a0HB 5535, which no local legislators are sponsoring, would require Firearm Owner's Identification Card applicants or those seeking to renew their FOIDs to take at least eight hours of approved handgun safety training. All applicants would have to undergo a criminal background check, including fingerprinting\u00a0HB 3222, which Buckner is sponsoring, would create an assault weapons registry\u00a0HB 2541, which none of the legislators are sponsoring, amends the Domestic Violence Act of 1986 to remove a requirement that an accused abuser be notified of a requested prohibition on firearm possession and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. An order of protection would prohibit a respondent from possessing any firearms for at least two years, and any FOID would be suspended.\u00a0HB 2769, which Robinson is sponsoring, creates the Microstamping Funding Program Act, establishing an Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority-administered grant program used for purchasing microstamp-ready firearms by law enforcement agencies alongside training. Microstamping is a ballistics identification technology in which microscopic markings are imprinted onto cartridges by certain firearms, allowing forensic experts to trace firearms to their registered owners.\u00a0HB 5374, which none of the legislators are sponsoring, allows school administrations to petition for firearms restraining orders in addition to allowing public bodies to hold closed meetings to consider security procedures, school building safety and security, and the use of personnel, equipment, reporting to law enforcement or legal action to respond to dangers.\u00a0Freshman Rep. Maura Hirschauer (D-49th), an organizer of a chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America from Batavia, introduced HB 5522 in January, but it was never considered in a substantive committee. Since the July 4 mass shooting in Highland Park, however, 50 more lawmakers, all Democrats, have signed on as cosponsors.Both Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-4th) and Robert Peters (D-13th) say they want to ban assault weapons. Hunter added that she would like to have an automatic five-day waiting period before purchasing firearms.\"But the problem is anytime you're talking about any gun laws, we can put all kinds of systems in place, but if someone is determined, and if they've already made up their mind that they want to harm someone, it can happen,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd it will happen.\"She blames \"a combination of things\" for Illinois' endemic gun violence, including the prodigious number of firearms of all kinds circulating around to links between mental health and gun violence.\"And then you have in my district, and on the South and West sides, you\u2019ve got violence. But it's different,\" Hunter said, noting that local shootings are often personal or retribution-related.Peters said the discussions and debate on gun control and abortion rights before the legislature returns to Springfield in the fall will take time.\u00a0 \u201cTo be frank, it\u2019s really painful and upsetting (expletive).\u201dHowever, Peters said there is \"a definite appetite\" to ban assault, and he said that \"appetite changes based on the organizing power of people.\"\"One thing to say to the broader public is, at least I know in the district I represent, people want to see us deal with the proliferation of guns,\u201d Peters said. \u201cBut I also think that everyone needs to call people who don't necessarily live in the district, who live in other districts, and tell them to let everyone know in every position of power that they, too, want us to do something.\"Something that is bold, so that everyone can go outside and enjoy a parade or a park or go to school. And I think that this is where the urgency that we're in also needs to be pushed into us being leaders in organizing a more fervent grassroots effort so that we can have some serious, systemic change.\"He noted that state power is limited because of Illinois', and his district's, proximity to Indiana, with its permissive gun laws. But he said the situation in Highland Park \u2014 Crimo's background could have triggered Illinois' red flag law \u2014 needs to be prevented from happening again, and the \"boundaries of this conversation around gun manufacturers\" and investors need to be wrestled with.Peters said he wants to have a focus on the supply side of gun manufacturing as well as holding firearm manufacturers and suppliers at higher levels of liability, though he noted that the federal 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes are committed with their products, \"makes that a little more complicated.\"\u00a0Illinois lawmakers had planned to convene a special session this summer, though it has yet to be scheduled.The proposed special session was first announced by Pritzker on June 24, the same day the U.S. Supreme Court released a decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide.The next scheduled meeting of the General Assembly is Nov. 15, when the regular fall veto session convenes.Asked if the governor would consider putting gun control measures on a special session docket alongside abortion rights measures, a spokesperson said, \u201cIllinois has taken the very important steps to strengthen our laws. But now, we will once again review everything we know about this gunman in the context of our laws and determine what more we can do to continue our public safety work.\u00a0\u201cAs the governor has said, his administration will work with the General Assembly to ensure we take on the gun lobby and do everything we can to further strengthen our gun safety and red flag laws. As this investigation progresses in the coming weeks we will learn more about this incident and if the law may have fallen short, and it is imperative we have all of the facts so we can work together to strengthen the laws already on the books. As we learn more, we will begin discussions with members of the General Assembly and advocates to get their input on not only legislation, but also timing.\u201dReached for comment, Buckner said \"we have to be committed to looking at everything,\" calling recently \"ridiculously high shooting numbers\" in Chicago, the Highland Park parade shooting \"a much too familiar pattern.\"\u00a0\"We have to look at laws that we have already put on the books and what the practical implications are,\" he said. \"We have to make sure the public is informed of the tools at all of our disposal to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them. I expect that our work in Springfield will focus on doing whatever is necessary to keep our communities safe.\"Tarver, however, took a dim view about whether the legislature will convene to address gun issues soon.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything happening in a special session \u2014 although I would hope we\u2019d have one \u2014 because there is still a general election,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think that would factor into what would be proposed and how people voted.Hancock reported from Springfield.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.ReporterGov. J.B. Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) easily won renomination to another term on Election Day with his running mate, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.\u201cFour years ago I told you that we\u2019d reverse the fiscal damage that Bruce Rauner did to this state, that I would end his hostage taking of the budget, reverse his credit downgrades and improve our state's finances,\u201d Pritzker said in an election night speech. \u201cToday we've had four balanced budgets in four years. We put a billion dollars in the state's rainy day fund. We reduced our state's pension liability and now we've received six credit upgrades.\u201dDuring his first term, Pritzker signed a sweeping abortion rights bill, the Reproductive Health Act, as well as legislation repealing a law requiring abortion providers to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion.He is also calling a special session of the General Assembly in the coming weeks to focus on creating legislation that will protect access to abortion, a move he announced moments after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling Roe vs. Wade.On election night, the governor led his supporters in a chant of \u201cwe will not go back.\u201dCook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, June 28Down-ballot, county Assessor Fritz Kaegi won another term, and former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias won the Illinois Democratic Party's nomination for secretary of state.In Kaegi\u2019s previous term, the Hyde Park native shifted more of the county\u2019s property tax burden from homeowners to commercial payers. Earlier on Election Day at Shoesmith Elementary School, 1330 E. 50th St., he noted that his reassessment led to a 9% reduction of homeowners' share in the tax burden, worth more than $600 million a year. Any future changes, now that his administration has done a reassessment, will come from incremental market changes.Kaegi acknowledged that there will be back-and-forth between his work and that of the Cook County Board of Review, the three-commissioner body in charge of adjudicating complaints about residential and commercial assessments, though he noted that his office is putting data about its commercial assessments online.\"People don't give the public enough credit for their insight and sense of what they want out of this office,\" he said. \"The public, they said, 'Do we really want to go back on the values of this office? Do we want to have a more conflicted person who's not following the rules? Who wants to give more favoritism to big business owners? Or do we want more fairness out of this office that takes the burdens off of average people?'\"Kaegi performed particularly well in the 4th and 5th Wards, and across the South Side on the whole. His primary opponent was Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kari Steele.Former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois Democratic Party's 2022 nominee for secretary of state, June 28Giannoulias will face downstate Republican state Rep. Dan Brady (105th) in the November general election.After losing the 2010 U.S. Senate race, Giannoulias held a job in wealth management from 2012 to 2018 at the Chicago office of Bank of New York Mellon. In 2019, he announced the formation of his own private investment company, Annoula Ventures. He said he wouldn\u2019t be involved with that private investment vehicle if elected secretary of state.Speaking with other slated Democrats outside of Shoesmith, Giannoulias noted the Supreme Court's recent ruling overturning federal abortion rights and the distinction between his party and the GOP on that issue.\"We're going to need every single person to come out and vote in November, to tell their friends to come out and vote to do everything we can to fight for the future of our daughters, our sons and our grandkids,\" he said. \"It's all about the future.\"The office is primarily known for administering motor vehicle services \u2013 driver\u2019s licenses and vehicle registrations \u2013 but it reaches far beyond that. The Illinois secretary of state is also the state librarian, which provides services to public libraries throughout the state. It also manages the state archives, serves as the state\u2019s official record-keeper, administers lobbying laws and operates its own police force.The major issues in the race will largely center on modernization of the office and shortening wait times at driver services facilities.Incumbent Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Maryana T. Spyropolous (D) won renomination to another six-year term alongside newcomers Patricia Flynn and Yumeka Brown; Elizabeth Joyce won the nomination to fill in a two-year term.Speaking on Election Day outside of Shoesmith Elementary School, Spyropolous said her work will focus on Lake Michigan shoreline restoration and local infrastructure improvements ahead of climate change, pending appropriations from the state government.\"If we go and we work on homes specifically, we'll have to look at the topography of certain areas, see if they've got a lot of flooding, try to invest in check valves or overhead plumbing,\" Spyropolous said, referring to valves that only let liquid flow through in one direction, which prevent contaminated water from reentering a domestic water supply, and domestic sewage systems that run a home's plumbing fixtures over the basement floor to a new sewer line to prevent flooding.She said the plan is to roll out the idea with a $400,000 pilot in Chatham, with potential expansion depending on its success.Spyropolous furthermore noted that work on the 50-year-old, multi-billion-dollar MWRD Deep Tunnel Project is ongoing: \"109 miles of intersecting tunnels and three reservoirs strategically placed throughout the county that take in about 22 million gallons.\"Four other Illinois Democrats, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, state Attorney General Kwame Raoul, state Treasurer Mike Frerichs and state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, won their primaries unopposed.Outgoing U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) won reelection to be the 1st congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman, and Southland state Rep. Will Davis (D-30th) won the election to be the 2nd congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman.Two local state legislators, Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) and Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), won their primaries unopposed and will face no opponents in November.\"I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to serve another term in the senate. I\u2019m excited to continue the fight for public safety for all and not a few in Springfield,\" Peters said in a statement.\"Over the last three years I\u2019ve been able to pass over 30 bills, move millions in violence prevention dollars and support millions in new infrastructure investment. This all happened due to my offices commitment to co-govern with constituents and advocates.\"I understand we are in extremely tense times nationally but I believe at the state level we can continue to push forward on lifting each other up and ensuring that our most in need get the support they deserve.\"As we head into the next few years we will need to keep Illinois at the forefront of progress against an ever more dangerous far right. I promise to be on the frontlines side by side with the district I represent.\"Buckner did not respond to a request for comment.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) also won unopposed and faces no opponent in November. He thanked voters in a statement and said he will continue to focus on economic equity, health care, mental health care and educational opportunities in the district, including trade and apprenticeship opportunities. He said he will also support the county's continuing efforts to reform its criminal justice system.\"Some specific goals include the return to a full-service emergency department at Provident Hospital, with ambulance access this coming fall, the 2023 renovation of Provident Hospital with a $240 million investment and the implementation of my 'Call to Action,'\" Lowry continued.\"Last week at my Peace Rally at Kenwood Academy, I issued a Call to Action to create a community center in every ward of Chicago. I called on elected at every level of government, faith leaders, community organizations, community members, not-for-profit entities and the business community to collaborate in this transformational effort. Such an effort will lessen violence today and present a pathway of opportunity and learning for generations to come. I eagerly look forward to my second term as Cook County commissioner of the 3rd district.\"Nowicki and Hancock reported from Springfield. Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.a.gettinger@hpherald.comRepublican state Sen. Darren Bailey (55th), a conservative downstate farmer\u00a0first elected to the General Assembly in 2018, won a come-from-behind victory in his party's June 28 primary to take on Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker this fall.Former President Donald Trump endorsed his campaign late in the primary campaign, and he had received underhanded support from Pritzker and other Democrats, who repeatedly attacked him in advertisements for his right-wing bonafides and in so doing highlighted them to Republican primary voters.As the tides shifted toward Bailey in recent weeks, the GOP race's one-time frontrunner, Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin adopted a new line of attack, repeatedly saying \u201ca vote for Darren Bailey is a vote for JB Pritzker,\u201d arguing that the governor put his dollars behind Bailey because he judged him as the weakest candidate.Bailey earlier in the campaign didn\u2019t disagree with the take that Pritzker viewed him as a weak candidate, but he warned Pritzker to \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d He has stated his intent to reshape the state\u2019s GOP as a more conservative entity, including by endorsing primary challengers of incumbent Republican state lawmakers.Bailey\u2019s nomination sets up a general election contest pitting Pritzker\u2019s progressive track record against a candidate who is far to the right of previous leaders of the state\u2019s Republican party.Pritzker, meanwhile, has touted Illinois\u2019 firmer fiscal footing since he became governor, pointing to a $1 billion contribution to the state\u2019s \u201crainy day\u201d fund, an added $500 million pension payment beyond statutory levels and about $900 million spent to pay down other interest-accruing health insurance debts.State Rep. Dan Brady (105th), of Bloomington, won the GOP secretary of state nomination. He is a funeral director by profession who served as McLean County coroner from 1992 until he was elected to the Illinois House in 2000, rising to the post of assistant minority leader.Other GOP primary victors include Mundelein attorney Kathy Salvi, who will run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth in November, and lawyer Tom DeVore, the party's nominee for attorney general.\u00a0State Rep. Tom Demmer (90th) won the GOP primary for treasurer unopposed, as did certified public accountant Shannon Teresi, the party's nominee for comptroller.Eric Carlson, of Lemont, won the 1st congressional district's GOP primary. The Tribune reports that he was convicted of sexual assault in 1995 and spent six years in prison. Thomas Lynch, a member of the downstate Iroquois County Board, appears to have won the 2nd congressional district's GOP primary.Locally, 4th Ward GOP committeewoman Lori Yokoyama won her party's primary to run against state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th).ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Jackson Women's Health Organization, which has ended the constitutional, nationwide right to an abortion.Abortion rights are still protected in Illinois, however, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said today that he would call the General Assembly into a special session to further protect that right after the court issued its decision.\"We knew this day was coming,\" he said at a press conference in Rogers Park. \"The extremists on the Supreme Court have made an abhorrent decision, one rooted in partisanship, leaving an indelible stain on our nation.\"\"To the right-wing officeholders who today are cheering the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: get your iron boot off women's necks! Hop off your high horse and know that what you\u2019re calling a 'celebration of life' today will actually lead to death \u2014 the death of women in abusive situations, the death of women whose health is at risk, the death of women and girls who will still seek abortions\u2014ones that are unsafe and performed by unqualified back-alley butchers.\"He was non-committal about what legislation the General Assembly may consider beyond measures ensuring there are enough medical professionals to care for the people expected to come to Illinois to get abortions.WTTW reports that other bills under consideration may be ones to strengthen protections for abortion care and to provide resources for people coming to the state for abortions. Senators could also pass a bill to prevent state officials from disciplining providers for providing abortions.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in her own news conference, threatened lawsuits against states who would punish people coming to Illinois for abortions \u2014 threatening Indiana for allowing guns to be trafficked across the state line if a precedent exists for people to sue those who come to Illinois for abortions \u2014 and promised to protect abortion rights in Chicago.Lightfoot, Chicago's first openly gay mayor, has previously stressed the vulnerability of federal LGBTQ rights if abortion rights fell.Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said the court\u2019s decision will not prevent women from getting abortions.\u201cWhat this decision will do is force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, or seek dangerous and unregulated means for an abortion,\u201d Preckwinkle said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will disproportionately impact women of color and poor women, like all policies built on inequity. It also removes all women's right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Under this ruling, contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights are now under attack. Illinois and Cook County will remain a safe haven for women, but as we deal with this harsh reality, we must continue to strengthen our resolve and fight back.\u201dState Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) called the decision \u201ca threat to broader fights for justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ca gateway for the far right to start attacking so many important rights we have today,\u201d one that \u201cwill not reduce abortions, but only further penalize working class communities especially working class Black and Brown communities.\u201d\u201cIllinois continues to lead the country when it comes to protecting the reproductive rights of our residents, and I know we will be a welcoming, safe place for people from hostile states that may be seeking an abortion,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to the organizers and the movement who demanded that Illinois be a leader on reproductive justice, and I am committed to working with them and my colleagues to expand people\u2019s rights in Illinois, not restrict them. I want to be clear that this is the beginning of a much broader movements\u2019 plan to attack marginalized communities and we must not back down from this challenge, but stand up and step out.\u201dIn a statement released from his mayoral campaign, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) called the court's decision \"rooted in misogyny and extreme political views.\"He tied health care access to women, and particularly Black women, being on a path to economic opportunity, linking that with his co-sponsorship of Illinois' Reproductive Health Care Act. He promised to fight for women as mayor of Chicago.U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) noted that the decision will hurt poor, rural and disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, and added that \u201cit opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban.\u201d\u201cIf the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers and children instead of prohibiting healthcare access and oppressing women,\u201d Rush said in a statement.In an interview, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) said Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, who voted with the majority, should never have been appointed to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama from appointing Justice Antonin Scalia's successor after his death and then refused to follow a precedent they set after the 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\"I hope that people realize that elections have consequences,\" Kelly said. \"If people don't vote, this is what happens.\"In a statement, Ald. Sophia King (4th), a former vice chair of Planned Parenthood Chicago, said pro-abortion rights people would not retreat but double-down and \"use this moment to galvanize and expand our base.\"\"The conservative movement is not done,\" she said. \"We expect rulings that will curtail or outright gut programs like affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and other hard-fought rights and programs that have moved this country forward. This attack undermines all of those and more. This is why it is so important that we come together and use every vehicle possible to protect our rights. Let's start by leveraging our voting power.\"Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), an attorney, called back to the 20th century civil rights battles and said they are continuing today.\"To be a woman, and to be a woman of color \u2014 there's just no end to the attacks,\" Hairston said. \"They keep on coming.\"\"It's going to impact Black and brown people most, as has every law that's been enacted. What the Supreme Court did today is unheard of,\" she said. \"Taking away people's rights? And while I haven't read the opinion yet, Justice Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact that nobody has the right to privacy, so it's very serious to me. Are we going to start tagging women from other states to make sure that they don't cross state lines? What exactly does it mean and at what point is it enough? This is not only deadly, but it takes us back centuries.Hairston added that people \u201cneed to be organizing more than ever. We are back to the '60s\u2026 Anybody who was born in the '80s, '90s or even the 2000s has no idea what this means.\"Pritzker was similarly dire.\"They've just taken away rights from more than half of the population of the United States,\" he said. \"Is this serious? Is this one of the worst things that's happened in our lifetimes, that the Supreme Court has done? I've been alive 57 years. They haven't taken away rights in my entire lifetime, and they're aiming to take away more rights.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comUChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine's teaching hospital, issued the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v.

Toni Preckwinkle celebrates after winning the February 2010 Democratic primary for the presidency of the Cook County Board of CommissionersToni Preckwinkle's political staff has instructed her not to say whether or not this campaign for reelection will be her last run for office.She's 75 years old. \"Clearly I'm an anomaly, because I took this job when I was 63, which is the point most people in their lives are seeking retirement, and I took on the toughest job of my political career,\" she said in an interview.Preckwinkle was first elected as President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. She said she decided to run because didn't think the incumbent president, Todd Stroger, would win reelection, and thought that someone who cared about \"access to health care for people who really need it and the inequities of the criminal justice system\" should hold the job.\u00a0When she took office that December, the slow recovery following the Great Recession weighed on local government finances nationwide. \u201cFor a number of years, things were a real mess,\u201d Preckwinkle said at the Cook County Democratic Party's headquarters, across Washington Street from City Hall in the Loop.\"When we came in, we had a $487 million deficit to close, and next year, I think the projected deficit is less than $20 million. But it's been a slog to get there,\" she said, laughing. \"I'm proud of the good work of our team.\" Over the years many financial staffers have moved on to work at the University of Chicago and the Obama Presidential Center.\"When I talk about the last 12 years, I usually talk about fiscal responsibility, transparency and improved services,\" said Preckwinkle. \"Basically, you can find out whatever we're doing online . . . Everything from our contracts to our policy documents,\" producing great bound reports of the county's expenditure of American Rescue Plan Act dollars for good measure.She said Cook County Health has tried hard to improve the quality of health care it gives and the access to that care. \"We've had a hospital system for 180 years; however, we've had some real challenges about operations in terms of maximizing revenues \u2014 which doesn't mean we turn anybody away at the door. It just means we work the system to get as much reimbursement as we can from the federal government for the services we provide,\" she said.Preckwinkle added that the Affordable Care Act has been a boon, because many people the system cared for who did not previously have insurance now do.There are 400,000 people in County Care, the Medicaid-managed care program \u2014 a function of the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which made a lot of 18- to 64-year-olds eligible, but that meant a lot more young and healthy people were suddenly in the county's Medicaid program. The program gets a per-person per-month reimbursement, and Preckwinkle said to the extent that those people do not need care, that reimbursement is a \"cash cow.\"The county also got $1 billion from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan Act, which it is using for behavioral health investments. One such investment is Preckwinkle\u2019s plan to create a Department of Behavioral Health Services.In terms of criminal justice reform, there are currently around 6,000 incarcerated people compared with 11,000 when Preckwinkle, an advocate for ending cash bail, took office. \"And that's because we've tried to make sure that people who are accused of low-level, nonviolent crimes didn't have to pay cash bonds to get out, because a lot of people couldn't even pay bonds of $100,\" she said.She also created the county's Bureau of Economic Development from the departments of Capital Planning, Community Development, and Building and Zoning. (The Workforce Department was spun off into the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership in conjunction with the city, under Mayor Rahm Emanuel.)Asked again whether this will be her final run for office, she said, \"Look, what I've done is laid out what I'm going to do for the next four years. That's where I am.\"Preckwinkle\u2019s challenger is former county Commissioner Richard Boykin (D-1st). Her reelection campaign has been endorsed by the Tribune editorial board.\u00a0Ultimately, Cook County Democratic primary voters will have their say this month whether or not she keeps her job.That job is different, and harder, than the City Council position she held from 1991 to 2010, which was oriented around constituent service and entailed people stopping her as she walked her dog, at the grocery store or in her ward office.\"You know all the people who you're helping, but when you have this job, you can help a lot of people, but you don't know any of them,\" she said. \"There isn't this sort of personal affirmation that you get from helping people and knowing them personally.\"Preckwinkle has been a politician for far longer than she taught school \u2014 her first, unsuccessful election was in 1983, and she was a teacher for 10 years \u2014 but she said dealing with teenagers, parents and faculty is good preparation for public life.\"Politics is public education,\" she said. \"The challenge is to try to figure out first of all what you want to do, how you're going to do it, and how you're going to translate it to the public in a way that you can understand, appreciate and hopefully get on board.\"Asked about the race to replace U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st), Preckwinkle said she will \u201cprobably not\u201d make an endorsement and declined to say whom she will vote for. But she spoke favorably about two candidates in particular, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) and state Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0\"I'm a person who's always believed that experience matters, and particularly experience in government matters,\u201d said Preckwinkle. \u201cPeople who have proven records of constituent service and commitment to issues that I care about, like Pat Dowell and Jacqui Collins, are people I'm more inclined to support than someone who doesn't have a track record nor very well thought-out positions issues. And this goes for everybody.\"She is, however, supporting state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) in his contested primary against Josef Michael Carr of South Shore.Preckwinkle also commented on the upcoming mayoral election, with local political figures having announced or rumored to consider runs \u201cin (her) own backyard.\u201d One such candidate is local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who announced his campaign in mid-May.\"That will be an interesting situation,\" Preckwinkle said, adding that she anticipates seeing a \u201ccattle call '' similar to the mayoral election of 2019, where she placed second out of 14 candidates.\u00a0Regarding the 2019 mayoral election, Preckwinkle said it was a miserable experience for her and an excruciating one for her children, one she would not subject them to again.\"Sometimes there's a perfect storm in your favor, and sometimes it's the perfect storm that drowns you,\" she said. \"Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.\"\"I got portrayed in that election as some sort of machine hack,\" she said. \"We're at a point in this country where if you run for office, you better have a spotless personal life \u2014 not just you but everybody around you, family, friends and neighbors \u2014 and you better be prepared to be pummeled.\u00a0When Preckwinkle leaves public life, she expects to go back to teaching at some level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) look on.ReporterMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at the lakefront in June 2020, as (left to right) state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th), a sign language interpreter and Ald. Sophia King (4th) look on.Industrial Massillon, Ohio, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's hometown near Akron, was not an easy place to be gay in the 1960s and '70s, and even when she went to college at the University of Michigan, she didn't know many out people in Ann Arbor.She came out in Chicago, after she matriculated at the University of Chicago Law School in 1986.\"Ironically in the conservative U. of C. Law School, there were a lot of gay people,\" Lightfoot said in an interview with the Herald. \"I\u00a0 just really felt like, \u2018OK, this is who I am\u2019 . . . It was just feeling comfortable in my own skin and feeling who I was.\"In addition to that, Lightfoot's Hyde Park years were the first time in her life that she \"really felt Black,\" she said. Lightfoot did not say that this was because she was living in the overwhelmingly Black South Side, but \"because there were so many negative things about being Black in Hyde Park.\"She recalled southward-facing barbed-wire fences on 61st Street \u2014 \"That sent a really clear message: we don't want the surrounding neighborhood, which was overwhelmingly Black, to be a part of the university community.\"Each of her three years of law school included \"a pretty significant racial event\" that she said was either caused or exacerbated by the law school.Bigelow Fellows teach first-year U. of C. Law School students academic legal writing; in Lightfoot's class, nine out of 175 students were Black. A few of the Black students didn't do well on the fellows' first paper, and so one of the teachers suggested putting all of the Black students in a remedial writing course.\"There was a professor there who said around this whole issue that the law school had an obligation to make sure that we were just as good as the white students by the time that we'd graduate. Of course he was white: no Black or brown professor would say such an absurd thing,\" she said. \"The tonality of that really set the stage for really hard stuff.\"Lightfoot also described an incident with another Black student being interviewed by a recruiter from\u00a0 Baker & McKenzie, then one of the country\u2019s largest law firms, during their final year at the school. According to Lightfoot (and reported in the Tribune) the recruiter made a string of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments during the interview, such as using slurs and retorting to the student\u2019s interest in golf that there were \u201cnot many golf courses in the ghetto.\u201d Lightfoot, who was president of the Law Students Association, helped put pressure on the university to suspend the firm from campus for a year.Lightfoot said that Hyde Park today \"is a very, very different place now than what it was.\"\"There were very little amenities, very little restaurants, very few things for a young person, like myself, to really do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole social life was on the North Side.\u201d Lightfoot added that she was \u201ctraumatized\u201d by her time in law school.\u00a0She lived in the neighborhood all three years, but she recalled that the school had buses that would take people to the North Side on the weekends. \"My knowledge and orientation of the city was outside of Hyde Park, not in Hyde Park,\" she said.An exception to that rule was Promontory Point.\"Promontory Point was such an oasis for me when I lived in Hyde Park,\" she said. \"When I first lived in Hyde Park, I lived at 55th and Everett, so right around the corner. So it was so easy for me to get to Promontory Point, and it was just this magical place where you're out there on the lake, people are swimming in the water, and you can see the rest of the city. I have such incredibly fond memories of Promontory Point.\"The thing that concerns me now is it's being washed away,\" she said. \"It's being eroded.\"\"We're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers, and fix it in a way that we're not going to have to come back five years or 10 years from now,\" Lightfoot said.Would that long-term fix preserve the steps' beloved exposed limestone, or would they be replaced by concrete, as is in place on much of the rest of the lakefront?\"Of course I love the way it looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away,\" Lightfoot said.That may be a tough pill for some people to swallow.\"There's a reason it hasn't been fixed yet,\" Lightfoot said. \"I absolutely love Promontory Point.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comMayor Lori Lightfoot announced her bid for reelection on June 7, asking voters for more time to run a city racked by crisis after crisis and touting herself as a fighter who has met those moments who can meet the ones to come.\u201cI don\u2019t look or sound like any other mayor we\u2019ve ever had before, and I\u2019ve had to fight to get a seat at the table. And, like so many in our city, I\u2019ve had to fight to have my voice heard,\u201d Lightfoot said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never back down from fighting every day to turn your voice into action.\u201d\u201cWhen we got knocked down by COVID, we came together as a City and we got right back up. Because that\u2019s who we are \u2013 and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to make so much progress, despite all that\u2019s been thrown at us.\u201cOf course there are tough challenges ahead. We have a lot of work to do, because change just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But together, we will make our city safer, fairer, and more equitable for all. Now, let\u2019s get back to work.\u201dShe campaigned the next day in Greater Grand Crossing, touting her Invest South/West initiative that seeks to spur investment on South and West Side neighborhoods through a combination of private and public funds. The program has targeted corridors in Bronzeville and South Shore; along South Cottage Grove Avenue, it has been tied to the development of the 4400 Grove complex and Northwestern Medicine's planned $100 million outpatient care center.Next February's election has attracted an unusually high number of declared and potential candidates for an election with an incumbent Chicago mayor, including local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th).\u201cMayor Lightfoot has proven to be utterly ill-equipped to lead Chicago,\" he said in a statement. \"Carjackings and violence are at record highs, economic disinvestment is drying up our neighborhoods, our schools are under-resourced, our police department is over-extended and under-staffed. Instead of a public safety plan, she\u2019s raised bridges, put up barricades and demanded curfews.\"\u201cWhen Chicago votes for a new Mayor, they\u2019re picking a new direction for our city. I\u2019m a skilled negotiator who\u2019s brought people together to get things done and passed groundbreaking, comprehensive laws around clean energy, banning ghost guns, and public safety and justice.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) talks about his legislation to end ghost guns in Illinois at the Rain or Shine Baptist Church of Chicago 704 E. 43rd St., Monday, March 28ReporterState Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) talks about his legislation to end ghost guns in Illinois at the Rain or Shine Baptist Church of Chicago 704 E. 43rd St., Monday, March 28Chicago mayoral candidate and local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) unveiled his public safety plan Tuesday morning, advocating for a dual approach of investing more money in both law enforcement and community resources. Buckner\u2019s announcement at Woodlawn\u2019s MetroSquash education center, 6100 S. Cottage Grove Ave., comes as crime becomes an increasingly politicized talking point for candidates in the mayoral and statewide races.\"I'm running for mayor to make Chicago safe, but we need a plan, and we need a mayor who can collaborate to get it done, who can work to create true safety in all 77 of Chicago's neighborhoods,\" Buckner said.Among his proposals, Buckner said he would fill the 1,600 Chicago Police Department vacancies in the first two years of his administration, as well as recruit more homicide detectives.One way to do this, he said, would be to remove applicant credit score reviews during the hiring process. (The logic behind the restrictions was that applicants who were in arrears would be more likely to take bribes.)Buckner also proposed a civilian-staffed \"Internet Intelligence Unit\" to surveil crimes being planned online, and wants to bolster communication between CPD and other independent police departments operating within city limits (e.g. the University of Chicago Police Department).While laying out his plan for increasing investments into CPD, Buckner nodded to many Chicagoans' deep distrust of the police.When he was 16-years-old, a police officer first told him that he \"fit a description.\" The same thing happened at 35-years-old. \u201cI'm well-aware of the necessity of rebuilding trust between our communities and law enforcement,\u201d Buckner said.One of Buckner\u2019s proposed solutions to increase CPD transparency is for all use of force incidents to be recorded and publicly posted within 30 days. He adds that he would also ensure CPD is in full compliance with the state attorney general's 2017 consent decree, a mandate of more than 500 department reforms, which was ordered after the police murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The consent decree is still being implemented and was recently given a three-year extension.He also pledged support for the passage of the Anjanette Young Ordinance, supported by local Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), that would codify restrictions on police warrants and raids. The ordinance, currently stalled in City Council and not supported by Mayor Lori Lightfoot, was proposed in response to the police department\u2019s 2019 mistaken raid of Anjanette Young\u2019s home, in which officers burst through the social worker\u2019s door and handcuffed her while she was naked.\"In a Buckner administration, if you are a police officer who does your job within the scope of the laws of Illinois, the City of Chicago and our U.S. Constitution, who operates in the bounds of your training, this will be the best big-city cop job you will find in America,\" he said.\u00a0However, Buckner added: \u201cWe cannot spend $1.9 billion dollars on CPD every year and not see results.\u201d Among non-law enforcement approaches to public safety, he said he wants to double the Chicago Office of Violence Prevention's funding to $33 million, increasing violence prevention programming citywide.\u00a0He also supports passing the \"Peace Book'' ordinance through City Council, an anti-violence plan proposed by the activist group GoodKids MadCity, which is oriented around restorative justice programming.He added that he would implement the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion method, which diverts nonviolent offenders to community harm-prevention programs, and said his administration would fund re-entry programs to combat recidivism.Buckner also proposed establishing a mental health option to 9-1-1 to ensure mental health and crisis specialists can respond to medical emergencies instead of police, as well as increased investments in the city\u2019s remaining mental health clinics. (State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) did something similar by establishing a new hotline, 9-8-8, which Illinoisans can call for mental health first-responders beginning on Jan. 1, 2023.)\"Solving crimes is what we must do, but preventing crimes before they happen is what we are capable of doing. But Chicago is stuck being reactive, desperately implementing curfews on our youth instead of investing in them and their neighborhoods,\" he said. \"We need to create safe, clean and bright community spaces in all 77 neighborhoods, especially for our youth.\"That means clean, well-lit green space citywide and a new youth engagement superintendent at Chicago Public Schools charged with reducing crimes young adults commit through expanding after-school programs in art, sports and music.\u00a0\"As the son of a law enforcement officer and a CPS teacher, I understand the importance of taking a balanced approach to safety and justice that tackles crime but also tackles the root causes of crime. We need short-term, mid-range and long-term plans in order to make Chicago safe,\" Buckner said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

In mid-May, an internal poll released by South Side state Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th), a candidate for the congressional seat, revealed that 42% of voters remain undecided.\u00a0The poll only asked about five candidates considered to be the frontrunners: Pat Dowell, Jacqui Collins, Karin Norington-Reaves, Jonathan Jackson and Jonathan Swain.

Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"Owners of firearms that do not have serial numbers \u2014 referred to as ghost guns \u2014 will have 180 days to take them to a federal firearm dealer to have them serialized or they will risk being charged with a misdemeanor.Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure containing that provision, House Bill 4383, into law last Wednesday in Chicago, aiming to crack down on the growing use of unserialized ghost guns that can be obtained without a background check.\u201cUnserialized, untraceable ghost guns have left a gap in the criminal law for those who wish to inflict violence and chaos on our streets, and they have abused and exploited that loophole,\u201d said local Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), the bill\u2019s House sponsor and a mayoral candidate, said at a news conference.The governor called the measure \u201cone piece of a larger strategy\u201d in reducing gun violence, but he said ultimately the federal government must take a more sweeping approach.\u201cWe're engaged in a multi-intergovernmental effort to interdict the transport of guns across state lines illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that 60% of the guns that are involved in shootings in the city of Chicago come from out of state, they come from Indiana mainly. But go downstate and talk to people where guns are coming across from Missouri. \u2026 Other states that surround us have much more lax laws for acquiring guns. That's a real challenge for us.\u201dThe measure applies to 3D-printed guns as well as unfinished receivers, which include \u201cany forging, casting, printing, extrusion, machined body, or similar article\u201d that can be converted into a functional firearm. It does not apply to antique, permanently inoperable guns or those manufactured before 1968.The owner of an unserialized firearm or unfinished frame will have 180 days from Wednesday\u2019s signing \u2014 or until Nov. 14 \u2014 to take it to a federal firearm dealer to receive a serial number.After that span, possession of an unserialized, unfinished firearm will become a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense, punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. A subsequent violation would be a Class 3 felony, punishable by two to five years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.Sellers of those guns or frames would be guilty of a Class 4 felony, punishable by one to three years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000, for a first violation. Subsequent violations would be a Class 2 felony punishable by three to seven years and a fine of up to $25,000.Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said ISP labs analyzed 62 unserialized ghost guns in 2020, 180 in 2021 and already 164 in 2022.\u201cSo we're gonna double it every year at this rate,\u201d he said. \u201cCriminals are finding it easier and cheaper to buy an unfinished firearm frame than to steal a gun or find one on the streets where the serial number has been defaced. With a little work, the unfinished frame becomes a fully functioning firearm.\u201dKelly said ghost guns include pistols, AR-15s and extended and high-capacity magazines.Pritzker said the measure builds on a Firearm Owners Identification card overhaul passed in 2021 that strengthened ISP\u2019s FOID enforcement abilities and directed the agency to create a searchable database with serial numbers of stolen guns.He also touted the state\u2019s increased investments in ISP crime labs and new ISP officers and said guns are only part of the problem.\u201cIt's also the underlying challenges \u2014 poverty in our communities, mental health treatment and substance use treatment \u2014 these are things that we have gone about significant efforts and dollars to try to build back up in our state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was better seven years ago and then we had two years of a budget impasse that wiped out a lot of those services. We're now not only rebuilding but actually doing better than before, and that's the direction we need to go because you want to prevent violence before it happens.\u201dThe Chicago Police Department has recorded 207 murders this year, down from last year\u2019s number of 223 over the same time frame but far outpacing 2018-20. Superintendent David Brown said ghost guns are a growing threat, and he noted there\u2019s been a 500 percent increase in shootings at police officers in Chicago over the past two years.\u201cIt's just a ruse to not have a serial number or a way to track and hold someone accountable to either manufacturing or buying and selling the gun,\u201d he said of the increase in ghost guns. \u201cSo this bill will close that ability to really hide from consequences, particularly in our courts, because it's not serialized.\u201dThe Gun Violence Prevention PAC, which backed the measure, said in a news release Illinois was the 12th state and first in the Midwest to regulate ghost guns.Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R.

Kam Buckner (D-26th) announces his candidacy for mayor of Chicago at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue, May 12State Rep. Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner (D-26th) is running for mayor to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot from City Hall in 2023.\u00a0\"I'm a son of Chicago. I was born and raised in the city. The city is extremely important to me. It's given me everything that I have, and I understand the difficulties that I face,\" he said in an interview. \"But I'm also raising my son in Chicago, and I understand the opportunities that we have to make Chicago the city that she deserves to be.\"We have spent so much time recently fighting with each other, and we've not spent enough time fighting for our city, and I think we need visionary, transformative leadership to actually do that work.\"The Bronzeville-based state representative said some core issues his campaign will focus on are improving Chicago Public Schools and reducing crime. His legislative district spans the city\u2019s lakefront, including parts of Gold Coast, South Loop, Bronzeville, Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn and South Shore.The chairman of the Illinois Black Caucus kicked off his campaign this afternoon at the corner of 18th Street and Wabash Avenue before a crowd of dozens of supporters.\u201cWe cannot wait a day longer for a safe and just Chicago for all of us,\u201d he said, calling for more investment in schools and ways to give the city\u2019s children a path to success. \u201cWe need a mayor who can bring people together to get things done for Chicago.\u201dBuckner was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2019 to replace Christian Mitchell, who resigned to become deputy governor. Buckner was reelected in 2020 without opposition, and has supported legislation on firearm restrictions, renewable energy development and criminal justice reform.\u00a0\u00a0He is the grandson of a Baptist minister and the son of a sheriff's deputy sergeant and a public school teacher from Mississippi who was the first in her family to go to college. He grew up in Roseland; his first memory, as a three-year-old, was attending Mayor Harold Washington's wake in the Loop.If elected, Buckner would be the first mayor since Washington to be a Chicago Public Schools graduate. \"My matriculation through that district is going to be important to me as we make decisions on bringing the city forward on an educational standpoint,\" he said.After graduating from Morgan Park High School, Buckner studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he played defensive tackle for the Fighting Illini football team. He later got a degree from the DePaul University College of Law.Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, Buckner's professional background was split between sports business and nonprofits. He worked on the Wrigley Field renovations and served as executive director for the youth organization World Sport Chicago (born out of the city\u2019s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics). He was also a member of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Capitol Hill staff and worked for former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.Buckner said he has the executive experience to run a city of millions of people and a City Council with 50 alderpersons. \"It is also evident to me that it requires us to bring folks together and to be able to have conversations,\" he said. \"If you look at the work I've done in Springfield, it has really been highlighted by bringing people together.\"In Springfield, Buckner championed legislation allowing Illinois college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses and another bill this year that would ban \"ghost guns,\" firearms made from kits or 3D-printed without serial numbers. He was also a lead negotiator on Gov. J.B. Pritzker's landmark 2021 energy plan, which will force fossil fuel power plants offline by 2045, and put billions of dollars toward renewable and nuclear energy.A crowd claps for state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12Just before his campaign launch, Buckner said his proudest accomplishment has been the passage of legislation around the Black Caucus' pillars: criminal justice, economic access, education and health care.As chair of the caucus' House bloc, Buckner has been a vocal defender of the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which will end cash bail for the vast majority of crimes in Illinois next year and change use-of-force guidelines for law enforcement, create a new police certification system and expand detainee rights.The third candidate to announce a mayoral bid, Buckner is up against two other South Siders: millionaire businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, who also ran in 2019, and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th).As campaign season heats up, Buckner\u2019s opponents may bring up past personal mistakes; he has pleaded guilty twice to driving under the influence. The first occurred in 2010 in Urbana, after he graduated from college, and the second as a freshman legislator in 2019, when Springfield police officers found him asleep at the wheel a few blocks from the statehouse, the Tribune reported. He has since paid the fines and completed the community service required for the misdemeanors.Throughout his career Buckner has been outspoken on issues of policing and public safety. Early in May 2020, he reported on a police officer stopping him and demanding to see proof of purchase and identification after he left a South Loop retailer, saying that the officer said he \"looked like he was up to something.\"\u201cWhich begs the question, what does someone who is up to something look like?\u201d Buckner asked on Twitter. He recalled the talks young Black boys receive \"on how to maneuver a society that often looks at you as a threat first\" and a mentor who told him as a teenager to \"dress like a prospect and not a suspect.\"At today\u2019s campaign launch, Buckner continued: \u201cWhere you live should not determine if you live,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a Black kid from the South Side, I know what it\u2019s like to lie down on the wet pavement handcuffed because police officers think I fit a description.\"I'm a lifelong South Sider who has decided to remain a South Sider, and it's important to me that I bring all those experiences to bear in City Hall,\" he said. \"I bring all of that with me in this race and, hopefully, a Buckner administration.\"If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on February 28, the two frontrunners will have a runoff on April 4.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.Mayoral candidate Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner unveils plan for Chicago Public Schools outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

He later got a degree from the DePaul University College of Law.Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, Buckner's professional background was split between sports business and nonprofits. He worked on the Wrigley Field renovations and served as executive director for the youth organization World Sport Chicago (born out of the city\u2019s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics). He was also a member of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Capitol Hill staff and worked for former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.Buckner said he has the executive experience to run a city of millions of people and a City Council with 50 alderpersons. \"It is also evident to me that it requires us to bring folks together and to be able to have conversations,\" he said. \"If you look at the work I've done in Springfield, it has really been highlighted by bringing people together.\"In Springfield, Buckner championed legislation allowing Illinois college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses and another bill this year that would ban \"ghost guns,\" firearms made from kits or 3D-printed without serial numbers. He was also a lead negotiator on Gov. J.B. Pritzker's landmark 2021 energy plan, which will force fossil fuel power plants offline by 2045, and put billions of dollars toward renewable and nuclear energy.A crowd claps for state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12Just before his campaign launch, Buckner said his proudest accomplishment has been the passage of legislation around the Black Caucus' pillars: criminal justice, economic access, education and health care.As chair of the caucus' House bloc, Buckner has been a vocal defender of the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which will end cash bail for the vast majority of crimes in Illinois next year and change use-of-force guidelines for law enforcement, create a new police certification system and expand detainee rights.The third candidate to announce a mayoral bid, Buckner is up against two other South Siders: millionaire businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, who also ran in 2019, and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th).As campaign season heats up, Buckner\u2019s opponents may bring up past personal mistakes; he has pleaded guilty twice to driving under the influence. The first occurred in 2010 in Urbana, after he graduated from college, and the second as a freshman legislator in 2019, when Springfield police officers found him asleep at the wheel a few blocks from the statehouse, the Tribune reported. He has since paid the fines and completed the community service required for the misdemeanors.Throughout his career Buckner has been outspoken on issues of policing and public safety. Early in May 2020, he reported on a police officer stopping him and demanding to see proof of purchase and identification after he left a South Loop retailer, saying that the officer said he \"looked like he was up to something.\"\u201cWhich begs the question, what does someone who is up to something look like?\u201d Buckner asked on Twitter. He recalled the talks young Black boys receive \"on how to maneuver a society that often looks at you as a threat first\" and a mentor who told him as a teenager to \"dress like a prospect and not a suspect.\"At today\u2019s campaign launch, Buckner continued: \u201cWhere you live should not determine if you live,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a Black kid from the South Side, I know what it\u2019s like to lie down on the wet pavement handcuffed because police officers think I fit a description.\"I'm a lifelong South Sider who has decided to remain a South Sider, and it's important to me that I bring all those experiences to bear in City Hall,\" he said. \"I bring all of that with me in this race and, hopefully, a Buckner administration.\"If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on February 28, the two frontrunners will have a runoff on April 4.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S.

We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S.

Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.In October, Chicago Police Department officer who had been investigated for affiliating with the white nationalist Proud Boys organization was found to have given false statements about it and given a 120-day suspension.A reporter subsequently asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot about why the department had not fired an officer affiliated with the far-right, anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic organization that participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol; Lightfoot said that characterization was overstated.Two years ago today a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to take down democracy. This mob included the Proud Boys \u2014 an extremist group Mayor Lightfoot excused in October when she said it was an \u2018overstatement\u2019 to call them anti-Semitic and anti-gay, and defended the Chicago Police Department\u2019s decision not to fire an officer with known links to the Proud Boys.Mayor Lightfoot cannot even say once what I\u2019ve said multiple times since that moment in October: Proud Boys have no place in our police department. Period.Public trust in the police is at an all-time low, and it\u2019s a slap in the face to every CPD officer dedicated to constitutional policing to have a mayor who defends Proud Boys\u2019 racism.There\u2019s a clear difference between Mayor Lightfoot and me: She defends the indefensible while I\u2019m inclined to action.

The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Woodlawn Ave.ReporterLeft to right: county Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her wife, First Lady Amy Eshleman, at the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence in Hyde Park on Sunday at Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave.Mayor Lori Lightfoot endorsed the effort underway by some Democrats in the state legislature to ban assault weapons in Illinois at a Sunday night vigil for victims and survivors of gun violence at Augustana Lutheran Church.All local state legislators and Gov. J.B. Pritzker support banning the weapons in Illinois. A House committee held a meeting on Monday on a bill by Rep. Bob Morgan (D-58th) \u2014 whose district includes North Shore suburb Highland Park, where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens more at a 4th of July parade with an AR-15-style semi automatic rifle \u2014 to ban assault weapons and other high caliber weapons. Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) is co-sponsoring that bill.\"As we solemnly recognize the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy, this is our opportunity,\" she said, noting the 1 million Americans who have been killed or wounded by gunfire in the decade since the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. \"This of course is an absurdity that in this country, with all our wealth, with our economy, that we can't solve this problem that plagues every community in our nation.\"She teased a city pilot program to provide more support to gun violence survivors in addition to banning assault weapons, saying it's about accountability and \"making sure that we're doing everything possible to make our communities safe.\"The Illinois General Assembly is considering a bill to ban assault rifles statewide in its January lame duck session. In a Monday interview after a state House committee's subject matter hearing on the topic, Buckner noted the Sept. 13 mass shooting in Washington Park that killed two and wounded seven more. No assault rifles were used then, and Buckner said discussions at the meeting included what to do about handguns modified with \u201cswitches\u201d to function like automatic weapons.Those are already largely illegal in Illinois, though criminals are altering those guns at home, often with parts bought online. Buckner got legislation passed earlier this year banning \"ghost guns,\" unserialized weapons often sold as a kit for at-home construction.\u00a0\"I don't know if that's going to actually make its way into this bill, but I think for communities where violence has plagued us for a very long time, that is a pertinent conversation that people are starting to bring up,\" Buckner said. \"I think we're a way's off from what the final piece of legislation will look like. We've got a chance for some amendments, fixes and some things that will make it more palatable to folks, and more effective. But I think that the appetite is definitely there.\"Buckner said he thinks legislation against gun switches would help, but he said he wants to have more conversations with violence-interruptors and law enforcement about how such a ban would work in practice.State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) spoke of the exhaustion that he and other advocates and policymakers face after years of mass shootings that make national news and \"shooting on the streets due to gang violence.\"\"We've been advocating the same solutions over and over and over again,\" he said. \"I'm tired of the fact that our approach to gun violence is to point at the community. Interpersonal violence is of itself a problem, but it is not the only problem,\" he said. \"Every time a bullet hits somebody, that is somebody's stock price going up. Every time there's a mass shooting, you look at Wall Street, and an investor is making a buck. It keeps happening, and those same people, those same investors, tell us, 'It's an individual's fault. It's your community's fault.'\"There is a clear correlation between mass shooting events and spikes in gunmakers' share prices. Peters said assault weapon bans would \"go after the fault of the problem: there are people making money hand-over-fist in this country when it comes to gun violence.\"Peters also said public safety means access to education, jobs, housing and transportation, not lock-them-up carceral policies. He praised anti-violence legislation in Illinois, which funds third-party programming in youth intervention services, violence interruption and trauma treatment. And he praised the University of Chicago Medical Center's new legal services for trauma victims (see story on page 7), saying more initiatives like that are necessary.The Rev. Nancy Goede, pastor of Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave., hosted the vigil. Her local colleagues Rabbi David Minkus of Congregation Rodfei Zedek, 5200 S. Hyde Park Blvd., and the Rev. Veroica Johnson of Hyde Park Union Church, 5600 S. Woodlawn Ave., who chairs the Interfaith Anti Violence Task Force of Hyde Park-Kenwood, also spoke.Johnson prayed to comfort victims' families, friends and communities. \"Unless we lament, which simply means 'cry out honestly about our pain,' we run the risk of normalizing this violence. We run the risk of getting numb by it and not getting moved by it,\" she said.\"Refuse to be silent,\" she said. \"Refuse to be silent about your loved ones. Refuse to be silent about guns. Refuse to be silent about all the causes of violence, including the historical lack of investment in our communities and young people. Cry out from your souls, and refuse to be silent.\"Chicago Survivors, which helps families affected by gun violence, organized the event. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Cook County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) and representatives from anti-violence and grief support organizations also spoke.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) has released a list of environmental goals for his mayoral administration should voters elect him next year, with a focus on environmental justice, sustainability and collaborative work and financing with the state and federal governments.\"Chicago has a real chance to get this right, to be the tip of the spear and lead the country in what a clean, green, sustainable, environmentally just big city looks like,\" he said in an interview.\u00a0Should he be elected, he would establish a staffed Department of Environment to create a comprehensive plan to address environmental threats to the city and a hundred-day Climate Blueprint Plan to target emission reductions and decrease consumption of fossil fuels. He said he would work with the county on efforts to finance cheap energy efficiency at a property level.\u00a0Buckner added that he would reconfigure the industrial zoning process to \"ensure no community is unnecessarily burdened.\"\"We know that, for a very long time, Chicago was \u2018the industrial city.\u2019 So we still have the remnants of being that industrial city here,\" he said. \"We have recycling and metal shredders and folks who are 'toxic polluters' who are very often situated in these sacrifice zones, specifically in places like the Southeast Side of Chicago, but there has been a big threat of this in places like Pilsen as well.Buckner also pointed to the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act that passed in 2021, which provides billions of dollars in funding for energy transition by shifting away from coal power to renewables and installing green workforces and infrastructure like electric vehicle purchases and chargers. He said the city will miss out on resources and momentum like this if it doesn't attach itself to recent state policymaking.\u00a0\"I think the city has operated in a piecemeal fashion when it comes to resources for environmental justice and sustainability, and part of that is because there is no Department of Environment in City Hall anymore,\" he said.\"The city not having the ability to coordinate with the Illinois (Environmental Protection Agency) on who gets permits, what those look like, who, more importantly, doesn't get a permit and how we do remediation, how we're sure that we're following the data on what's happening in these communities. That's been a huge deficit in this administration, and that will change immediately once we stand up a Department of Environment and give them the resources to actually do their job,\" he said.In addition to plans to reach 100% renewable energy by 2035, he wants to change out lead service lines by splitting the city into priority zones for the work, saying the city is unsystematically doing so now. In September, WTTW reported that the city has only replaced 0.5% of eligible lead pipes.\u00a0There are federal dollars to do this through the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan signed into law last year. \"There is a lot of money that's available at the U.S. (Environmental Protection Agency) level that's going to be able to come down to municipalities across the country,\" Buckner said.\u00a0To control flooding, a problem getting worse even along Lake Michigan\u2019s shores as climate change accelerates, Buckner would work with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District to develop an alternative solution to the city's current combined sewer system, in which wastewater and stormwater combine into the same pipes, which has resulted in sanitary waste pollution during deluges. He would like to install infrastructure like permeable pavement that allows rainfall and snowmelt to seep into covered ground.He supports preserving Promontory Point's limestone revetment as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other entities begin work to buttress the peninsula park. He said he has been aware of the park\u2019s erosion issue since he worked on U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) staff 15 years ago.\u00a0\"After conversations with neighbors, advocates and folks who do this work for a living, it's important to me that we take a preservationist approach to this, to make sure that we're preserving, getting this right and not putting ourselves in a worse position,\" Buckner said.There is also federal infrastructure money available for urban open spaces, lead pipe replacement and a number of other green issues. The problem, Buckner charged, is that the city is not going to Washington with cohesive plans for green investments.\u00a0\"Coordination is key in many ways when we talk about real sustainability, real environmental justice, protecting our waterways, our systems and our lakefront as well.\"It's that collaborationist impulse that Buckner says positions him to be a good executive as mayor.\"What Chicago really is asking for right now is leadership and vision that can bring people together, and that's something that this mayor has proven that she is not able or willing to do,\" he said. \"My track record as a public official in Springfield has been one of finding a way to solutions, finding a way to 'yes' instead of getting stuck at 'no.'\"He pointed to his ability to bring the American Civil Liberties Union and the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the banking lobby to support the organized retail crime bill that aims to prevent \u201csmash-and-grabs\u201d by improving prosecutorial abilities against the crimes\u2019 organizers. \"The leadership came to me to figure out how to do that, and I got it done,\" said Buckner.He pointed to his negotiations with labor, environmentalists and utility companies over the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.\"People want a mayor to be fighting for them, and it's not always about 'compromise' \u2014 it's about finding a way to get to the right answer. But I'm the first legislator in the Midwest to take on the gun lobby and win,\" he said, pointing to his legislation that bans unserialized \"ghost guns\" in Illinois.\u00a0\"Not only do I have the ability to fight, but I have the ability to bring folks together and find a solution, which has eluded this mayor in her last three and a half years in office,\" Buckner said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.Mayoral candidate Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner unveils plan for Chicago Public Schools outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "title": "Ald. Sophia King running for mayor, talks city council tenure and public safety",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

The mid-South Side\u2019s state senators and representatives are joining these calls.\u201cWhile I support an assault weapon and high-capacity magazine ban at the state level, we urgently need federal regulation on the weapons of war and high-capacity magazines that are used only for mass murder,\u201d Pritzker said in a statement released last week. \u201cIllinois is not an island, and even with some of the strictest gun laws in the nation, our state is only as safe as the state with the weakest laws \u2014 many of which border Illinois.\u201d\u00a0The weapon used in the Highland Park shooting has been identified as a Smith and Wesson M&P 15, a semi-automatic rifle that holds 30-round magazines of 5.56mm ammunition. The alleged shooter, Robert Crimo III, reportedly used three such magazines during his attack on a Fourth of July parade, firing off more than 80 bullets in a matter of just a few minutes.\u00a0The letters \u201cM&P\u201d stand for \u201cMilitary & Police,\u201d though it and others like it are widely available to civilians at sporting goods stores throughout the country.\u00a0The weapon used in Highland Park is also similar to guns used in other recent mass shootings, including the May 24 shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, that left 19 children and two teachers dead, and the May 14 shooting at a Buffalo, New York, grocery store that killed 10 people.\u00a0All those weapons are modeled after the Colt AR-15, a semi-automatic version of a rifle originally designed for military use.\u00a0On July 11, Pritzker and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering were at the White House for an event with President Joe Biden marking the recent signing of the Safer Communities Act, the first significant federal law addressing gun violence in nearly 30 years. Laws created by the act include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, more funding for crisis intervention programs and further criminalization for arms trafficking.\u201cWe had a number of conversations immediately after the attack in Highland Park and I've been impressed with the way they've handled things. It's been extraordinary,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd as the three of us have discussed, we have more to do.\u201d\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle also attended the bill-signing.President Joe Biden (left) and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle (right) pose at the White House on Monday, July 11. Preckwinkle's communications director, Nick Shields, is at center.Later that day, Pritzker appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and he repeated calls for additional measures to control gun violence, such as banning assault rifles and high-capacity magazines .\u00a0The mid-South Side\u2019s state senators are in agreement about banning assault rifles, and the area\u2019s state legislators all said they want to pursue gun control legislation, but it is unclear when the General Assembly will reconvene before its scheduled date.Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) listed six pieces of legislation the Illinois General Assembly could act on, adding that more \u201cis being proposed, contemplated and discussed\u201d:\u00a0House Bill 5522 would make it a felony to buy or sell assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, additionally requiring existing owners of such weapons to register them with the Illinois State Police and prohibiting those owners from selling them in-state to anyone but a federally licensed firearms dealer. Robinson and Reps. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) are sponsoring it.\u00a0HB 5535, which no local legislators are sponsoring, would require Firearm Owner's Identification Card applicants or those seeking to renew their FOIDs to take at least eight hours of approved handgun safety training. All applicants would have to undergo a criminal background check, including fingerprinting\u00a0HB 3222, which Buckner is sponsoring, would create an assault weapons registry\u00a0HB 2541, which none of the legislators are sponsoring, amends the Domestic Violence Act of 1986 to remove a requirement that an accused abuser be notified of a requested prohibition on firearm possession and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. An order of protection would prohibit a respondent from possessing any firearms for at least two years, and any FOID would be suspended.\u00a0HB 2769, which Robinson is sponsoring, creates the Microstamping Funding Program Act, establishing an Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority-administered grant program used for purchasing microstamp-ready firearms by law enforcement agencies alongside training. Microstamping is a ballistics identification technology in which microscopic markings are imprinted onto cartridges by certain firearms, allowing forensic experts to trace firearms to their registered owners.\u00a0HB 5374, which none of the legislators are sponsoring, allows school administrations to petition for firearms restraining orders in addition to allowing public bodies to hold closed meetings to consider security procedures, school building safety and security, and the use of personnel, equipment, reporting to law enforcement or legal action to respond to dangers.\u00a0Freshman Rep. Maura Hirschauer (D-49th), an organizer of a chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America from Batavia, introduced HB 5522 in January, but it was never considered in a substantive committee. Since the July 4 mass shooting in Highland Park, however, 50 more lawmakers, all Democrats, have signed on as cosponsors.Both Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-4th) and Robert Peters (D-13th) say they want to ban assault weapons. Hunter added that she would like to have an automatic five-day waiting period before purchasing firearms.\"But the problem is anytime you're talking about any gun laws, we can put all kinds of systems in place, but if someone is determined, and if they've already made up their mind that they want to harm someone, it can happen,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cAnd it will happen.\"She blames \"a combination of things\" for Illinois' endemic gun violence, including the prodigious number of firearms of all kinds circulating around to links between mental health and gun violence.\"And then you have in my district, and on the South and West sides, you\u2019ve got violence. But it's different,\" Hunter said, noting that local shootings are often personal or retribution-related.Peters said the discussions and debate on gun control and abortion rights before the legislature returns to Springfield in the fall will take time.\u00a0 \u201cTo be frank, it\u2019s really painful and upsetting (expletive).\u201dHowever, Peters said there is \"a definite appetite\" to ban assault, and he said that \"appetite changes based on the organizing power of people.\"\"One thing to say to the broader public is, at least I know in the district I represent, people want to see us deal with the proliferation of guns,\u201d Peters said. \u201cBut I also think that everyone needs to call people who don't necessarily live in the district, who live in other districts, and tell them to let everyone know in every position of power that they, too, want us to do something.\"Something that is bold, so that everyone can go outside and enjoy a parade or a park or go to school. And I think that this is where the urgency that we're in also needs to be pushed into us being leaders in organizing a more fervent grassroots effort so that we can have some serious, systemic change.\"He noted that state power is limited because of Illinois', and his district's, proximity to Indiana, with its permissive gun laws. But he said the situation in Highland Park \u2014 Crimo's background could have triggered Illinois' red flag law \u2014 needs to be prevented from happening again, and the \"boundaries of this conversation around gun manufacturers\" and investors need to be wrestled with.Peters said he wants to have a focus on the supply side of gun manufacturing as well as holding firearm manufacturers and suppliers at higher levels of liability, though he noted that the federal 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes are committed with their products, \"makes that a little more complicated.\"\u00a0Illinois lawmakers had planned to convene a special session this summer, though it has yet to be scheduled.The proposed special session was first announced by Pritzker on June 24, the same day the U.S. Supreme Court released a decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide.The next scheduled meeting of the General Assembly is Nov. 15, when the regular fall veto session convenes.Asked if the governor would consider putting gun control measures on a special session docket alongside abortion rights measures, a spokesperson said, \u201cIllinois has taken the very important steps to strengthen our laws. But now, we will once again review everything we know about this gunman in the context of our laws and determine what more we can do to continue our public safety work.\u00a0\u201cAs the governor has said, his administration will work with the General Assembly to ensure we take on the gun lobby and do everything we can to further strengthen our gun safety and red flag laws. As this investigation progresses in the coming weeks we will learn more about this incident and if the law may have fallen short, and it is imperative we have all of the facts so we can work together to strengthen the laws already on the books. As we learn more, we will begin discussions with members of the General Assembly and advocates to get their input on not only legislation, but also timing.\u201dReached for comment, Buckner said \"we have to be committed to looking at everything,\" calling recently \"ridiculously high shooting numbers\" in Chicago, the Highland Park parade shooting \"a much too familiar pattern.\"\u00a0\"We have to look at laws that we have already put on the books and what the practical implications are,\" he said. \"We have to make sure the public is informed of the tools at all of our disposal to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn\u2019t have them. I expect that our work in Springfield will focus on doing whatever is necessary to keep our communities safe.\"Tarver, however, took a dim view about whether the legislature will convene to address gun issues soon.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything happening in a special session \u2014 although I would hope we\u2019d have one \u2014 because there is still a general election,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think that would factor into what would be proposed and how people voted.Hancock reported from Springfield.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.ReporterGov. J.B. Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) easily won renomination to another term on Election Day with his running mate, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.\u201cFour years ago I told you that we\u2019d reverse the fiscal damage that Bruce Rauner did to this state, that I would end his hostage taking of the budget, reverse his credit downgrades and improve our state's finances,\u201d Pritzker said in an election night speech. \u201cToday we've had four balanced budgets in four years. We put a billion dollars in the state's rainy day fund. We reduced our state's pension liability and now we've received six credit upgrades.\u201dDuring his first term, Pritzker signed a sweeping abortion rights bill, the Reproductive Health Act, as well as legislation repealing a law requiring abortion providers to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion.He is also calling a special session of the General Assembly in the coming weeks to focus on creating legislation that will protect access to abortion, a move he announced moments after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling Roe vs. Wade.On election night, the governor led his supporters in a chant of \u201cwe will not go back.\u201dCook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, June 28Down-ballot, county Assessor Fritz Kaegi won another term, and former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias won the Illinois Democratic Party's nomination for secretary of state.In Kaegi\u2019s previous term, the Hyde Park native shifted more of the county\u2019s property tax burden from homeowners to commercial payers. Earlier on Election Day at Shoesmith Elementary School, 1330 E. 50th St., he noted that his reassessment led to a 9% reduction of homeowners' share in the tax burden, worth more than $600 million a year. Any future changes, now that his administration has done a reassessment, will come from incremental market changes.Kaegi acknowledged that there will be back-and-forth between his work and that of the Cook County Board of Review, the three-commissioner body in charge of adjudicating complaints about residential and commercial assessments, though he noted that his office is putting data about its commercial assessments online.\"People don't give the public enough credit for their insight and sense of what they want out of this office,\" he said. \"The public, they said, 'Do we really want to go back on the values of this office? Do we want to have a more conflicted person who's not following the rules? Who wants to give more favoritism to big business owners? Or do we want more fairness out of this office that takes the burdens off of average people?'\"Kaegi performed particularly well in the 4th and 5th Wards, and across the South Side on the whole. His primary opponent was Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kari Steele.Former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois Democratic Party's 2022 nominee for secretary of state, June 28Giannoulias will face downstate Republican state Rep. Dan Brady (105th) in the November general election.After losing the 2010 U.S. Senate race, Giannoulias held a job in wealth management from 2012 to 2018 at the Chicago office of Bank of New York Mellon. In 2019, he announced the formation of his own private investment company, Annoula Ventures. He said he wouldn\u2019t be involved with that private investment vehicle if elected secretary of state.Speaking with other slated Democrats outside of Shoesmith, Giannoulias noted the Supreme Court's recent ruling overturning federal abortion rights and the distinction between his party and the GOP on that issue.\"We're going to need every single person to come out and vote in November, to tell their friends to come out and vote to do everything we can to fight for the future of our daughters, our sons and our grandkids,\" he said. \"It's all about the future.\"The office is primarily known for administering motor vehicle services \u2013 driver\u2019s licenses and vehicle registrations \u2013 but it reaches far beyond that. The Illinois secretary of state is also the state librarian, which provides services to public libraries throughout the state. It also manages the state archives, serves as the state\u2019s official record-keeper, administers lobbying laws and operates its own police force.The major issues in the race will largely center on modernization of the office and shortening wait times at driver services facilities.Incumbent Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Maryana T. Spyropolous (D) won renomination to another six-year term alongside newcomers Patricia Flynn and Yumeka Brown; Elizabeth Joyce won the nomination to fill in a two-year term.Speaking on Election Day outside of Shoesmith Elementary School, Spyropolous said her work will focus on Lake Michigan shoreline restoration and local infrastructure improvements ahead of climate change, pending appropriations from the state government.\"If we go and we work on homes specifically, we'll have to look at the topography of certain areas, see if they've got a lot of flooding, try to invest in check valves or overhead plumbing,\" Spyropolous said, referring to valves that only let liquid flow through in one direction, which prevent contaminated water from reentering a domestic water supply, and domestic sewage systems that run a home's plumbing fixtures over the basement floor to a new sewer line to prevent flooding.She said the plan is to roll out the idea with a $400,000 pilot in Chatham, with potential expansion depending on its success.Spyropolous furthermore noted that work on the 50-year-old, multi-billion-dollar MWRD Deep Tunnel Project is ongoing: \"109 miles of intersecting tunnels and three reservoirs strategically placed throughout the county that take in about 22 million gallons.\"Four other Illinois Democrats, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, state Attorney General Kwame Raoul, state Treasurer Mike Frerichs and state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, won their primaries unopposed.Outgoing U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) won reelection to be the 1st congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman, and Southland state Rep. Will Davis (D-30th) won the election to be the 2nd congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman.Two local state legislators, Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) and Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), won their primaries unopposed and will face no opponents in November.\"I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to serve another term in the senate. I\u2019m excited to continue the fight for public safety for all and not a few in Springfield,\" Peters said in a statement.\"Over the last three years I\u2019ve been able to pass over 30 bills, move millions in violence prevention dollars and support millions in new infrastructure investment. This all happened due to my offices commitment to co-govern with constituents and advocates.\"I understand we are in extremely tense times nationally but I believe at the state level we can continue to push forward on lifting each other up and ensuring that our most in need get the support they deserve.\"As we head into the next few years we will need to keep Illinois at the forefront of progress against an ever more dangerous far right. I promise to be on the frontlines side by side with the district I represent.\"Buckner did not respond to a request for comment.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) also won unopposed and faces no opponent in November. He thanked voters in a statement and said he will continue to focus on economic equity, health care, mental health care and educational opportunities in the district, including trade and apprenticeship opportunities. He said he will also support the county's continuing efforts to reform its criminal justice system.\"Some specific goals include the return to a full-service emergency department at Provident Hospital, with ambulance access this coming fall, the 2023 renovation of Provident Hospital with a $240 million investment and the implementation of my 'Call to Action,'\" Lowry continued.\"Last week at my Peace Rally at Kenwood Academy, I issued a Call to Action to create a community center in every ward of Chicago. I called on elected at every level of government, faith leaders, community organizations, community members, not-for-profit entities and the business community to collaborate in this transformational effort. Such an effort will lessen violence today and present a pathway of opportunity and learning for generations to come. I eagerly look forward to my second term as Cook County commissioner of the 3rd district.\"Nowicki and Hancock reported from Springfield. Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.a.gettinger@hpherald.comRepublican state Sen. Darren Bailey (55th), a conservative downstate farmer\u00a0first elected to the General Assembly in 2018, won a come-from-behind victory in his party's June 28 primary to take on Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker this fall.Former President Donald Trump endorsed his campaign late in the primary campaign, and he had received underhanded support from Pritzker and other Democrats, who repeatedly attacked him in advertisements for his right-wing bonafides and in so doing highlighted them to Republican primary voters.As the tides shifted toward Bailey in recent weeks, the GOP race's one-time frontrunner, Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin adopted a new line of attack, repeatedly saying \u201ca vote for Darren Bailey is a vote for JB Pritzker,\u201d arguing that the governor put his dollars behind Bailey because he judged him as the weakest candidate.Bailey earlier in the campaign didn\u2019t disagree with the take that Pritzker viewed him as a weak candidate, but he warned Pritzker to \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d He has stated his intent to reshape the state\u2019s GOP as a more conservative entity, including by endorsing primary challengers of incumbent Republican state lawmakers.Bailey\u2019s nomination sets up a general election contest pitting Pritzker\u2019s progressive track record against a candidate who is far to the right of previous leaders of the state\u2019s Republican party.Pritzker, meanwhile, has touted Illinois\u2019 firmer fiscal footing since he became governor, pointing to a $1 billion contribution to the state\u2019s \u201crainy day\u201d fund, an added $500 million pension payment beyond statutory levels and about $900 million spent to pay down other interest-accruing health insurance debts.State Rep. Dan Brady (105th), of Bloomington, won the GOP secretary of state nomination. He is a funeral director by profession who served as McLean County coroner from 1992 until he was elected to the Illinois House in 2000, rising to the post of assistant minority leader.Other GOP primary victors include Mundelein attorney Kathy Salvi, who will run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth in November, and lawyer Tom DeVore, the party's nominee for attorney general.\u00a0State Rep. Tom Demmer (90th) won the GOP primary for treasurer unopposed, as did certified public accountant Shannon Teresi, the party's nominee for comptroller.Eric Carlson, of Lemont, won the 1st congressional district's GOP primary. The Tribune reports that he was convicted of sexual assault in 1995 and spent six years in prison. Thomas Lynch, a member of the downstate Iroquois County Board, appears to have won the 2nd congressional district's GOP primary.Locally, 4th Ward GOP committeewoman Lori Yokoyama won her party's primary to run against state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th).ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Jackson Women's Health Organization, which has ended the constitutional, nationwide right to an abortion.Abortion rights are still protected in Illinois, however, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said today that he would call the General Assembly into a special session to further protect that right after the court issued its decision.\"We knew this day was coming,\" he said at a press conference in Rogers Park. \"The extremists on the Supreme Court have made an abhorrent decision, one rooted in partisanship, leaving an indelible stain on our nation.\"\"To the right-wing officeholders who today are cheering the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: get your iron boot off women's necks! Hop off your high horse and know that what you\u2019re calling a 'celebration of life' today will actually lead to death \u2014 the death of women in abusive situations, the death of women whose health is at risk, the death of women and girls who will still seek abortions\u2014ones that are unsafe and performed by unqualified back-alley butchers.\"He was non-committal about what legislation the General Assembly may consider beyond measures ensuring there are enough medical professionals to care for the people expected to come to Illinois to get abortions.WTTW reports that other bills under consideration may be ones to strengthen protections for abortion care and to provide resources for people coming to the state for abortions. Senators could also pass a bill to prevent state officials from disciplining providers for providing abortions.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in her own news conference, threatened lawsuits against states who would punish people coming to Illinois for abortions \u2014 threatening Indiana for allowing guns to be trafficked across the state line if a precedent exists for people to sue those who come to Illinois for abortions \u2014 and promised to protect abortion rights in Chicago.Lightfoot, Chicago's first openly gay mayor, has previously stressed the vulnerability of federal LGBTQ rights if abortion rights fell.Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said the court\u2019s decision will not prevent women from getting abortions.\u201cWhat this decision will do is force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, or seek dangerous and unregulated means for an abortion,\u201d Preckwinkle said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will disproportionately impact women of color and poor women, like all policies built on inequity. It also removes all women's right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Under this ruling, contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights are now under attack. Illinois and Cook County will remain a safe haven for women, but as we deal with this harsh reality, we must continue to strengthen our resolve and fight back.\u201dState Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) called the decision \u201ca threat to broader fights for justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ca gateway for the far right to start attacking so many important rights we have today,\u201d one that \u201cwill not reduce abortions, but only further penalize working class communities especially working class Black and Brown communities.\u201d\u201cIllinois continues to lead the country when it comes to protecting the reproductive rights of our residents, and I know we will be a welcoming, safe place for people from hostile states that may be seeking an abortion,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to the organizers and the movement who demanded that Illinois be a leader on reproductive justice, and I am committed to working with them and my colleagues to expand people\u2019s rights in Illinois, not restrict them. I want to be clear that this is the beginning of a much broader movements\u2019 plan to attack marginalized communities and we must not back down from this challenge, but stand up and step out.\u201dIn a statement released from his mayoral campaign, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) called the court's decision \"rooted in misogyny and extreme political views.\"He tied health care access to women, and particularly Black women, being on a path to economic opportunity, linking that with his co-sponsorship of Illinois' Reproductive Health Care Act. He promised to fight for women as mayor of Chicago.U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) noted that the decision will hurt poor, rural and disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, and added that \u201cit opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban.\u201d\u201cIf the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers and children instead of prohibiting healthcare access and oppressing women,\u201d Rush said in a statement.In an interview, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) said Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, who voted with the majority, should never have been appointed to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama from appointing Justice Antonin Scalia's successor after his death and then refused to follow a precedent they set after the 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\"I hope that people realize that elections have consequences,\" Kelly said. \"If people don't vote, this is what happens.\"In a statement, Ald. Sophia King (4th), a former vice chair of Planned Parenthood Chicago, said pro-abortion rights people would not retreat but double-down and \"use this moment to galvanize and expand our base.\"\"The conservative movement is not done,\" she said. \"We expect rulings that will curtail or outright gut programs like affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and other hard-fought rights and programs that have moved this country forward. This attack undermines all of those and more. This is why it is so important that we come together and use every vehicle possible to protect our rights. Let's start by leveraging our voting power.\"Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), an attorney, called back to the 20th century civil rights battles and said they are continuing today.\"To be a woman, and to be a woman of color \u2014 there's just no end to the attacks,\" Hairston said. \"They keep on coming.\"\"It's going to impact Black and brown people most, as has every law that's been enacted. What the Supreme Court did today is unheard of,\" she said. \"Taking away people's rights? And while I haven't read the opinion yet, Justice Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact that nobody has the right to privacy, so it's very serious to me. Are we going to start tagging women from other states to make sure that they don't cross state lines? What exactly does it mean and at what point is it enough? This is not only deadly, but it takes us back centuries.Hairston added that people \u201cneed to be organizing more than ever. We are back to the '60s\u2026 Anybody who was born in the '80s, '90s or even the 2000s has no idea what this means.\"Pritzker was similarly dire.\"They've just taken away rights from more than half of the population of the United States,\" he said. \"Is this serious? Is this one of the worst things that's happened in our lifetimes, that the Supreme Court has done? I've been alive 57 years. They haven't taken away rights in my entire lifetime, and they're aiming to take away more rights.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comUChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine's teaching hospital, issued the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization:\"As an academic health system based in Illinois, where abortion remains legal, and the only hospital-based abortion provider on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the University of Chicago Medicine plays an essential role for the community and for patients needing high-quality care.\"Our organization has a lengthy record of providing high-quality, evidence-based reproductive healthcare and a strong reputation of training the brightest future physicians to offer these clinical services to patients. This involves a broad range of medical care, including abortion, contraception/family planning, fertility treatment, care for general and high-risk pregnancies, and miscarriage management. These are common services that are integral to obstetrical and gynecological medicine and a vital part of comprehensive medical education for physicians in training.\"Our health system remains committed to providing the full spectrum of safe reproductive healthcare and is preparing for how we can best serve patients who travel to Illinois to seek our care and services.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Toni Preckwinkle celebrates after winning the February 2010 Democratic primary for the presidency of the Cook County Board of CommissionersToni Preckwinkle's political staff has instructed her not to say whether or not this campaign for reelection will be her last run for office.She's 75 years old. \"Clearly I'm an anomaly, because I took this job when I was 63, which is the point most people in their lives are seeking retirement, and I took on the toughest job of my political career,\" she said in an interview.Preckwinkle was first elected as President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. She said she decided to run because didn't think the incumbent president, Todd Stroger, would win reelection, and thought that someone who cared about \"access to health care for people who really need it and the inequities of the criminal justice system\" should hold the job.\u00a0When she took office that December, the slow recovery following the Great Recession weighed on local government finances nationwide. \u201cFor a number of years, things were a real mess,\u201d Preckwinkle said at the Cook County Democratic Party's headquarters, across Washington Street from City Hall in the Loop.\"When we came in, we had a $487 million deficit to close, and next year, I think the projected deficit is less than $20 million. But it's been a slog to get there,\" she said, laughing. \"I'm proud of the good work of our team.\" Over the years many financial staffers have moved on to work at the University of Chicago and the Obama Presidential Center.\"When I talk about the last 12 years, I usually talk about fiscal responsibility, transparency and improved services,\" said Preckwinkle. \"Basically, you can find out whatever we're doing online . . . Everything from our contracts to our policy documents,\" producing great bound reports of the county's expenditure of American Rescue Plan Act dollars for good measure.She said Cook County Health has tried hard to improve the quality of health care it gives and the access to that care. \"We've had a hospital system for 180 years; however, we've had some real challenges about operations in terms of maximizing revenues \u2014 which doesn't mean we turn anybody away at the door. It just means we work the system to get as much reimbursement as we can from the federal government for the services we provide,\" she said.Preckwinkle added that the Affordable Care Act has been a boon, because many people the system cared for who did not previously have insurance now do.There are 400,000 people in County Care, the Medicaid-managed care program \u2014 a function of the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which made a lot of 18- to 64-year-olds eligible, but that meant a lot more young and healthy people were suddenly in the county's Medicaid program. The program gets a per-person per-month reimbursement, and Preckwinkle said to the extent that those people do not need care, that reimbursement is a \"cash cow.\"The county also got $1 billion from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan Act, which it is using for behavioral health investments. One such investment is Preckwinkle\u2019s plan to create a Department of Behavioral Health Services.In terms of criminal justice reform, there are currently around 6,000 incarcerated people compared with 11,000 when Preckwinkle, an advocate for ending cash bail, took office. \"And that's because we've tried to make sure that people who are accused of low-level, nonviolent crimes didn't have to pay cash bonds to get out, because a lot of people couldn't even pay bonds of $100,\" she said.She also created the county's Bureau of Economic Development from the departments of Capital Planning, Community Development, and Building and Zoning. (The Workforce Department was spun off into the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership in conjunction with the city, under Mayor Rahm Emanuel.)Asked again whether this will be her final run for office, she said, \"Look, what I've done is laid out what I'm going to do for the next four years. That's where I am.\"Preckwinkle\u2019s challenger is former county Commissioner Richard Boykin (D-1st). Her reelection campaign has been endorsed by the Tribune editorial board.\u00a0Ultimately, Cook County Democratic primary voters will have their say this month whether or not she keeps her job.That job is different, and harder, than the City Council position she held from 1991 to 2010, which was oriented around constituent service and entailed people stopping her as she walked her dog, at the grocery store or in her ward office.\"You know all the people who you're helping, but when you have this job, you can help a lot of people, but you don't know any of them,\" she said. \"There isn't this sort of personal affirmation that you get from helping people and knowing them personally.\"Preckwinkle has been a politician for far longer than she taught school \u2014 her first, unsuccessful election was in 1983, and she was a teacher for 10 years \u2014 but she said dealing with teenagers, parents and faculty is good preparation for public life.\"Politics is public education,\" she said. \"The challenge is to try to figure out first of all what you want to do, how you're going to do it, and how you're going to translate it to the public in a way that you can understand, appreciate and hopefully get on board.\"Asked about the race to replace U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st), Preckwinkle said she will \u201cprobably not\u201d make an endorsement and declined to say whom she will vote for. But she spoke favorably about two candidates in particular, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) and state Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0\"I'm a person who's always believed that experience matters, and particularly experience in government matters,\u201d said Preckwinkle. \u201cPeople who have proven records of constituent service and commitment to issues that I care about, like Pat Dowell and Jacqui Collins, are people I'm more inclined to support than someone who doesn't have a track record nor very well thought-out positions issues. And this goes for everybody.\"She is, however, supporting state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) in his contested primary against Josef Michael Carr of South Shore.Preckwinkle also commented on the upcoming mayoral election, with local political figures having announced or rumored to consider runs \u201cin (her) own backyard.\u201d One such candidate is local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who announced his campaign in mid-May.\"That will be an interesting situation,\" Preckwinkle said, adding that she anticipates seeing a \u201ccattle call '' similar to the mayoral election of 2019, where she placed second out of 14 candidates.\u00a0Regarding the 2019 mayoral election, Preckwinkle said it was a miserable experience for her and an excruciating one for her children, one she would not subject them to again.\"Sometimes there's a perfect storm in your favor, and sometimes it's the perfect storm that drowns you,\" she said. \"Everything that could have gone wrong went wrong.\"\"I got portrayed in that election as some sort of machine hack,\" she said. \"We're at a point in this country where if you run for office, you better have a spotless personal life \u2014 not just you but everybody around you, family, friends and neighbors \u2014 and you better be prepared to be pummeled.\u00a0When Preckwinkle leaves public life, she expects to go back to teaching at some level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) look on.ReporterMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at the lakefront in June 2020, as (left to right) state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th), a sign language interpreter and Ald. Sophia King (4th) look on.Industrial Massillon, Ohio, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's hometown near Akron, was not an easy place to be gay in the 1960s and '70s, and even when she went to college at the University of Michigan, she didn't know many out people in Ann Arbor.She came out in Chicago, after she matriculated at the University of Chicago Law School in 1986.\"Ironically in the conservative U. of C. Law School, there were a lot of gay people,\" Lightfoot said in an interview with the Herald. \"I\u00a0 just really felt like, \u2018OK, this is who I am\u2019 . . . It was just feeling comfortable in my own skin and feeling who I was.\"In addition to that, Lightfoot's Hyde Park years were the first time in her life that she \"really felt Black,\" she said. Lightfoot did not say that this was because she was living in the overwhelmingly Black South Side, but \"because there were so many negative things about being Black in Hyde Park.\"She recalled southward-facing barbed-wire fences on 61st Street \u2014 \"That sent a really clear message: we don't want the surrounding neighborhood, which was overwhelmingly Black, to be a part of the university community.\"Each of her three years of law school included \"a pretty significant racial event\" that she said was either caused or exacerbated by the law school.Bigelow Fellows teach first-year U. of C. Law School students academic legal writing; in Lightfoot's class, nine out of 175 students were Black. A few of the Black students didn't do well on the fellows' first paper, and so one of the teachers suggested putting all of the Black students in a remedial writing course.\"There was a professor there who said around this whole issue that the law school had an obligation to make sure that we were just as good as the white students by the time that we'd graduate. Of course he was white: no Black or brown professor would say such an absurd thing,\" she said. \"The tonality of that really set the stage for really hard stuff.\"Lightfoot also described an incident with another Black student being interviewed by a recruiter from\u00a0 Baker & McKenzie, then one of the country\u2019s largest law firms, during their final year at the school. According to Lightfoot (and reported in the Tribune) the recruiter made a string of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments during the interview, such as using slurs and retorting to the student\u2019s interest in golf that there were \u201cnot many golf courses in the ghetto.\u201d Lightfoot, who was president of the Law Students Association, helped put pressure on the university to suspend the firm from campus for a year.Lightfoot said that Hyde Park today \"is a very, very different place now than what it was.\"\"There were very little amenities, very little restaurants, very few things for a young person, like myself, to really do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole social life was on the North Side.\u201d Lightfoot added that she was \u201ctraumatized\u201d by her time in law school.\u00a0She lived in the neighborhood all three years, but she recalled that the school had buses that would take people to the North Side on the weekends. \"My knowledge and orientation of the city was outside of Hyde Park, not in Hyde Park,\" she said.An exception to that rule was Promontory Point.\"Promontory Point was such an oasis for me when I lived in Hyde Park,\" she said. \"When I first lived in Hyde Park, I lived at 55th and Everett, so right around the corner. So it was so easy for me to get to Promontory Point, and it was just this magical place where you're out there on the lake, people are swimming in the water, and you can see the rest of the city. I have such incredibly fond memories of Promontory Point.\"The thing that concerns me now is it's being washed away,\" she said. \"It's being eroded.\"\"We're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers, and fix it in a way that we're not going to have to come back five years or 10 years from now,\" Lightfoot said.Would that long-term fix preserve the steps' beloved exposed limestone, or would they be replaced by concrete, as is in place on much of the rest of the lakefront?\"Of course I love the way it looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away,\" Lightfoot said.That may be a tough pill for some people to swallow.\"There's a reason it hasn't been fixed yet,\" Lightfoot said. \"I absolutely love Promontory Point.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comMayor Lori Lightfoot announced her bid for reelection on June 7, asking voters for more time to run a city racked by crisis after crisis and touting herself as a fighter who has met those moments who can meet the ones to come.\u201cI don\u2019t look or sound like any other mayor we\u2019ve ever had before, and I\u2019ve had to fight to get a seat at the table. And, like so many in our city, I\u2019ve had to fight to have my voice heard,\u201d Lightfoot said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never back down from fighting every day to turn your voice into action.\u201d\u201cWhen we got knocked down by COVID, we came together as a City and we got right back up. Because that\u2019s who we are \u2013 and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to make so much progress, despite all that\u2019s been thrown at us.\u201cOf course there are tough challenges ahead. We have a lot of work to do, because change just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But together, we will make our city safer, fairer, and more equitable for all. Now, let\u2019s get back to work.\u201dShe campaigned the next day in Greater Grand Crossing, touting her Invest South/West initiative that seeks to spur investment on South and West Side neighborhoods through a combination of private and public funds. The program has targeted corridors in Bronzeville and South Shore; along South Cottage Grove Avenue, it has been tied to the development of the 4400 Grove complex and Northwestern Medicine's planned $100 million outpatient care center.Next February's election has attracted an unusually high number of declared and potential candidates for an election with an incumbent Chicago mayor, including local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th).\u201cMayor Lightfoot has proven to be utterly ill-equipped to lead Chicago,\" he said in a statement. \"Carjackings and violence are at record highs, economic disinvestment is drying up our neighborhoods, our schools are under-resourced, our police department is over-extended and under-staffed. Instead of a public safety plan, she\u2019s raised bridges, put up barricades and demanded curfews.\"\u201cWhen Chicago votes for a new Mayor, they\u2019re picking a new direction for our city. I\u2019m a skilled negotiator who\u2019s brought people together to get things done and passed groundbreaking, comprehensive laws around clean energy, banning ghost guns, and public safety and justice.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) talks about his legislation to end ghost guns in Illinois at the Rain or Shine Baptist Church of Chicago 704 E. 43rd St., Monday, March 28ReporterState Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) talks about his legislation to end ghost guns in Illinois at the Rain or Shine Baptist Church of Chicago 704 E. 43rd St., Monday, March 28Chicago mayoral candidate and local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) unveiled his public safety plan Tuesday morning, advocating for a dual approach of investing more money in both law enforcement and community resources. Buckner\u2019s announcement at Woodlawn\u2019s MetroSquash education center, 6100 S. Cottage Grove Ave., comes as crime becomes an increasingly politicized talking point for candidates in the mayoral and statewide races.\"I'm running for mayor to make Chicago safe, but we need a plan, and we need a mayor who can collaborate to get it done, who can work to create true safety in all 77 of Chicago's neighborhoods,\" Buckner said.Among his proposals, Buckner said he would fill the 1,600 Chicago Police Department vacancies in the first two years of his administration, as well as recruit more homicide detectives.One way to do this, he said, would be to remove applicant credit score reviews during the hiring process. (The logic behind the restrictions was that applicants who were in arrears would be more likely to take bribes.)Buckner also proposed a civilian-staffed \"Internet Intelligence Unit\" to surveil crimes being planned online, and wants to bolster communication between CPD and other independent police departments operating within city limits (e.g. the University of Chicago Police Department).While laying out his plan for increasing investments into CPD, Buckner nodded to many Chicagoans' deep distrust of the police.When he was 16-years-old, a police officer first told him that he \"fit a description.\" The same thing happened at 35-years-old. \u201cI'm well-aware of the necessity of rebuilding trust between our communities and law enforcement,\u201d Buckner said.One of Buckner\u2019s proposed solutions to increase CPD transparency is for all use of force incidents to be recorded and publicly posted within 30 days. He adds that he would also ensure CPD is in full compliance with the state attorney general's 2017 consent decree, a mandate of more than 500 department reforms, which was ordered after the police murder of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. The consent decree is still being implemented and was recently given a three-year extension.He also pledged support for the passage of the Anjanette Young Ordinance, supported by local Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), that would codify restrictions on police warrants and raids. The ordinance, currently stalled in City Council and not supported by Mayor Lori Lightfoot, was proposed in response to the police department\u2019s 2019 mistaken raid of Anjanette Young\u2019s home, in which officers burst through the social worker\u2019s door and handcuffed her while she was naked.\"In a Buckner administration, if you are a police officer who does your job within the scope of the laws of Illinois, the City of Chicago and our U.S. Constitution, who operates in the bounds of your training, this will be the best big-city cop job you will find in America,\" he said.\u00a0However, Buckner added: \u201cWe cannot spend $1.9 billion dollars on CPD every year and not see results.\u201d Among non-law enforcement approaches to public safety, he said he wants to double the Chicago Office of Violence Prevention's funding to $33 million, increasing violence prevention programming citywide.\u00a0He also supports passing the \"Peace Book'' ordinance through City Council, an anti-violence plan proposed by the activist group GoodKids MadCity, which is oriented around restorative justice programming.He added that he would implement the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion method, which diverts nonviolent offenders to community harm-prevention programs, and said his administration would fund re-entry programs to combat recidivism.Buckner also proposed establishing a mental health option to 9-1-1 to ensure mental health and crisis specialists can respond to medical emergencies instead of police, as well as increased investments in the city\u2019s remaining mental health clinics. (State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) did something similar by establishing a new hotline, 9-8-8, which Illinoisans can call for mental health first-responders beginning on Jan. 1, 2023.)\"Solving crimes is what we must do, but preventing crimes before they happen is what we are capable of doing. But Chicago is stuck being reactive, desperately implementing curfews on our youth instead of investing in them and their neighborhoods,\" he said. \"We need to create safe, clean and bright community spaces in all 77 neighborhoods, especially for our youth.\"That means clean, well-lit green space citywide and a new youth engagement superintendent at Chicago Public Schools charged with reducing crimes young adults commit through expanding after-school programs in art, sports and music.\u00a0\"As the son of a law enforcement officer and a CPS teacher, I understand the importance of taking a balanced approach to safety and justice that tackles crime but also tackles the root causes of crime. We need short-term, mid-range and long-term plans in order to make Chicago safe,\" Buckner said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

In mid-May, an internal poll released by South Side state Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th), a candidate for the congressional seat, revealed that 42% of voters remain undecided.\u00a0The poll only asked about five candidates considered to be the frontrunners: Pat Dowell, Jacqui Collins, Karin Norington-Reaves, Jonathan Jackson and Jonathan Swain.

They will vote for one of three MWRD candidates who are running for a two-year term.There are also judicial vacancies to fill by election on the Democratic primary ballot. Injustice Watch, a local nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism organization, is publishing a guide to those elections based on bar associations' reviews, candidates' histories and public records for voters, available at injusticewatch.org.On the Republican ballot, seven candidates have filed to run against Duckworth. The nominations for attorney general and secretary of state are also contested. Six candidates are running for governor, with a joint WGN-The Hill-Emerson College poll finding Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin leading the pack at 24.1%, followed by downstate state Sen. Darren Bailey (55th). Nearly 37% of voters were undecided. The Herald plans to send the gubernatorial campaigns questionnaires about urban and civil rights policy.Four GOP candidates are running to replace Rush in Congress: Eric Carlson of Lemont, Philanise White of South Chicago, Geno Young of Calumet Heights and Jeffrey T.

  "text": "Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who sponsored House Bill 4383, speaks at a May 18 news conference at which Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure that regulates \"ghost guns.\"Owners of firearms that do not have serial numbers \u2014 referred to as ghost guns \u2014 will have 180 days to take them to a federal firearm dealer to have them serialized or they will risk being charged with a misdemeanor.Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the measure containing that provision, House Bill 4383, into law last Wednesday in Chicago, aiming to crack down on the growing use of unserialized ghost guns that can be obtained without a background check.\u201cUnserialized, untraceable ghost guns have left a gap in the criminal law for those who wish to inflict violence and chaos on our streets, and they have abused and exploited that loophole,\u201d said local Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), the bill\u2019s House sponsor and a mayoral candidate, said at a news conference.The governor called the measure \u201cone piece of a larger strategy\u201d in reducing gun violence, but he said ultimately the federal government must take a more sweeping approach.\u201cWe're engaged in a multi-intergovernmental effort to interdict the transport of guns across state lines illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that 60% of the guns that are involved in shootings in the city of Chicago come from out of state, they come from Indiana mainly. But go downstate and talk to people where guns are coming across from Missouri. \u2026 Other states that surround us have much more lax laws for acquiring guns. That's a real challenge for us.\u201dThe measure applies to 3D-printed guns as well as unfinished receivers, which include \u201cany forging, casting, printing, extrusion, machined body, or similar article\u201d that can be converted into a functional firearm. It does not apply to antique, permanently inoperable guns or those manufactured before 1968.The owner of an unserialized firearm or unfinished frame will have 180 days from Wednesday\u2019s signing \u2014 or until Nov. 14 \u2014 to take it to a federal firearm dealer to receive a serial number.After that span, possession of an unserialized, unfinished firearm will become a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense, punishable by up to 364 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,500. A subsequent violation would be a Class 3 felony, punishable by two to five years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000.Sellers of those guns or frames would be guilty of a Class 4 felony, punishable by one to three years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000, for a first violation. Subsequent violations would be a Class 2 felony punishable by three to seven years and a fine of up to $25,000.Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said ISP labs analyzed 62 unserialized ghost guns in 2020, 180 in 2021 and already 164 in 2022.\u201cSo we're gonna double it every year at this rate,\u201d he said. \u201cCriminals are finding it easier and cheaper to buy an unfinished firearm frame than to steal a gun or find one on the streets where the serial number has been defaced. With a little work, the unfinished frame becomes a fully functioning firearm.\u201dKelly said ghost guns include pistols, AR-15s and extended and high-capacity magazines.Pritzker said the measure builds on a Firearm Owners Identification card overhaul passed in 2021 that strengthened ISP\u2019s FOID enforcement abilities and directed the agency to create a searchable database with serial numbers of stolen guns.He also touted the state\u2019s increased investments in ISP crime labs and new ISP officers and said guns are only part of the problem.\u201cIt's also the underlying challenges \u2014 poverty in our communities, mental health treatment and substance use treatment \u2014 these are things that we have gone about significant efforts and dollars to try to build back up in our state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was better seven years ago and then we had two years of a budget impasse that wiped out a lot of those services. We're now not only rebuilding but actually doing better than before, and that's the direction we need to go because you want to prevent violence before it happens.\u201dThe Chicago Police Department has recorded 207 murders this year, down from last year\u2019s number of 223 over the same time frame but far outpacing 2018-20. Superintendent David Brown said ghost guns are a growing threat, and he noted there\u2019s been a 500 percent increase in shootings at police officers in Chicago over the past two years.\u201cIt's just a ruse to not have a serial number or a way to track and hold someone accountable to either manufacturing or buying and selling the gun,\u201d he said of the increase in ghost guns. \u201cSo this bill will close that ability to really hide from consequences, particularly in our courts, because it's not serialized.\u201dThe Gun Violence Prevention PAC, which backed the measure, said in a news release Illinois was the 12th state and first in the Midwest to regulate ghost guns.Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R.

Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12ReporterState Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) announces his candidacy for mayor of Chicago at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue, May 12State Rep. Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner (D-26th) is running for mayor to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot from City Hall in 2023.\u00a0\"I'm a son of Chicago. I was born and raised in the city. The city is extremely important to me. It's given me everything that I have, and I understand the difficulties that I face,\" he said in an interview. \"But I'm also raising my son in Chicago, and I understand the opportunities that we have to make Chicago the city that she deserves to be.\"We have spent so much time recently fighting with each other, and we've not spent enough time fighting for our city, and I think we need visionary, transformative leadership to actually do that work.\"The Bronzeville-based state representative said some core issues his campaign will focus on are improving Chicago Public Schools and reducing crime. His legislative district spans the city\u2019s lakefront, including parts of Gold Coast, South Loop, Bronzeville, Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn and South Shore.The chairman of the Illinois Black Caucus kicked off his campaign this afternoon at the corner of 18th Street and Wabash Avenue before a crowd of dozens of supporters.\u201cWe cannot wait a day longer for a safe and just Chicago for all of us,\u201d he said, calling for more investment in schools and ways to give the city\u2019s children a path to success. \u201cWe need a mayor who can bring people together to get things done for Chicago.\u201dBuckner was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2019 to replace Christian Mitchell, who resigned to become deputy governor. Buckner was reelected in 2020 without opposition, and has supported legislation on firearm restrictions, renewable energy development and criminal justice reform.\u00a0\u00a0He is the grandson of a Baptist minister and the son of a sheriff's deputy sergeant and a public school teacher from Mississippi who was the first in her family to go to college. He grew up in Roseland; his first memory, as a three-year-old, was attending Mayor Harold Washington's wake in the Loop.If elected, Buckner would be the first mayor since Washington to be a Chicago Public Schools graduate. \"My matriculation through that district is going to be important to me as we make decisions on bringing the city forward on an educational standpoint,\" he said.After graduating from Morgan Park High School, Buckner studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he played defensive tackle for the Fighting Illini football team. He later got a degree from the DePaul University College of Law.Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, Buckner's professional background was split between sports business and nonprofits. He worked on the Wrigley Field renovations and served as executive director for the youth organization World Sport Chicago (born out of the city\u2019s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics). He was also a member of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Capitol Hill staff and worked for former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.Buckner said he has the executive experience to run a city of millions of people and a City Council with 50 alderpersons. \"It is also evident to me that it requires us to bring folks together and to be able to have conversations,\" he said. \"If you look at the work I've done in Springfield, it has really been highlighted by bringing people together.\"In Springfield, Buckner championed legislation allowing Illinois college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses and another bill this year that would ban \"ghost guns,\" firearms made from kits or 3D-printed without serial numbers. He was also a lead negotiator on Gov. J.B. Pritzker's landmark 2021 energy plan, which will force fossil fuel power plants offline by 2045, and put billions of dollars toward renewable and nuclear energy.A crowd claps for state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12Just before his campaign launch, Buckner said his proudest accomplishment has been the passage of legislation around the Black Caucus' pillars: criminal justice, economic access, education and health care.As chair of the caucus' House bloc, Buckner has been a vocal defender of the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which will end cash bail for the vast majority of crimes in Illinois next year and change use-of-force guidelines for law enforcement, create a new police certification system and expand detainee rights.The third candidate to announce a mayoral bid, Buckner is up against two other South Siders: millionaire businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, who also ran in 2019, and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th).As campaign season heats up, Buckner\u2019s opponents may bring up past personal mistakes; he has pleaded guilty twice to driving under the influence. The first occurred in 2010 in Urbana, after he graduated from college, and the second as a freshman legislator in 2019, when Springfield police officers found him asleep at the wheel a few blocks from the statehouse, the Tribune reported. He has since paid the fines and completed the community service required for the misdemeanors.Throughout his career Buckner has been outspoken on issues of policing and public safety. Early in May 2020, he reported on a police officer stopping him and demanding to see proof of purchase and identification after he left a South Loop retailer, saying that the officer said he \"looked like he was up to something.\"\u201cWhich begs the question, what does someone who is up to something look like?\u201d Buckner asked on Twitter. He recalled the talks young Black boys receive \"on how to maneuver a society that often looks at you as a threat first\" and a mentor who told him as a teenager to \"dress like a prospect and not a suspect.\"At today\u2019s campaign launch, Buckner continued: \u201cWhere you live should not determine if you live,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a Black kid from the South Side, I know what it\u2019s like to lie down on the wet pavement handcuffed because police officers think I fit a description.\"I'm a lifelong South Sider who has decided to remain a South Sider, and it's important to me that I bring all those experiences to bear in City Hall,\" he said. \"I bring all of that with me in this race and, hopefully, a Buckner administration.\"If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on February 28, the two frontrunners will have a runoff on April 4.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.ReporterGov. J.B. Pritzker announces he will call a special session of the General Assembly to focus on reproductive health rights in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) easily won renomination to another term on Election Day with his running mate, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton.\u201cFour years ago I told you that we\u2019d reverse the fiscal damage that Bruce Rauner did to this state, that I would end his hostage taking of the budget, reverse his credit downgrades and improve our state's finances,\u201d Pritzker said in an election night speech. \u201cToday we've had four balanced budgets in four years. We put a billion dollars in the state's rainy day fund. We reduced our state's pension liability and now we've received six credit upgrades.\u201dDuring his first term, Pritzker signed a sweeping abortion rights bill, the Reproductive Health Act, as well as legislation repealing a law requiring abortion providers to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion.He is also calling a special session of the General Assembly in the coming weeks to focus on creating legislation that will protect access to abortion, a move he announced moments after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 ruling Roe vs. Wade.On election night, the governor led his supporters in a chant of \u201cwe will not go back.\u201dCook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, June 28Down-ballot, county Assessor Fritz Kaegi won another term, and former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias won the Illinois Democratic Party's nomination for secretary of state.In Kaegi\u2019s previous term, the Hyde Park native shifted more of the county\u2019s property tax burden from homeowners to commercial payers. Earlier on Election Day at Shoesmith Elementary School, 1330 E. 50th St., he noted that his reassessment led to a 9% reduction of homeowners' share in the tax burden, worth more than $600 million a year. Any future changes, now that his administration has done a reassessment, will come from incremental market changes.Kaegi acknowledged that there will be back-and-forth between his work and that of the Cook County Board of Review, the three-commissioner body in charge of adjudicating complaints about residential and commercial assessments, though he noted that his office is putting data about its commercial assessments online.\"People don't give the public enough credit for their insight and sense of what they want out of this office,\" he said. \"The public, they said, 'Do we really want to go back on the values of this office? Do we want to have a more conflicted person who's not following the rules? Who wants to give more favoritism to big business owners? Or do we want more fairness out of this office that takes the burdens off of average people?'\"Kaegi performed particularly well in the 4th and 5th Wards, and across the South Side on the whole. His primary opponent was Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kari Steele.Former state Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois Democratic Party's 2022 nominee for secretary of state, June 28Giannoulias will face downstate Republican state Rep. Dan Brady (105th) in the November general election.After losing the 2010 U.S. Senate race, Giannoulias held a job in wealth management from 2012 to 2018 at the Chicago office of Bank of New York Mellon. In 2019, he announced the formation of his own private investment company, Annoula Ventures. He said he wouldn\u2019t be involved with that private investment vehicle if elected secretary of state.Speaking with other slated Democrats outside of Shoesmith, Giannoulias noted the Supreme Court's recent ruling overturning federal abortion rights and the distinction between his party and the GOP on that issue.\"We're going to need every single person to come out and vote in November, to tell their friends to come out and vote to do everything we can to fight for the future of our daughters, our sons and our grandkids,\" he said. \"It's all about the future.\"The office is primarily known for administering motor vehicle services \u2013 driver\u2019s licenses and vehicle registrations \u2013 but it reaches far beyond that. The Illinois secretary of state is also the state librarian, which provides services to public libraries throughout the state. It also manages the state archives, serves as the state\u2019s official record-keeper, administers lobbying laws and operates its own police force.The major issues in the race will largely center on modernization of the office and shortening wait times at driver services facilities.Incumbent Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Maryana T. Spyropolous (D) won renomination to another six-year term alongside newcomers Patricia Flynn and Yumeka Brown; Elizabeth Joyce won the nomination to fill in a two-year term.Speaking on Election Day outside of Shoesmith Elementary School, Spyropolous said her work will focus on Lake Michigan shoreline restoration and local infrastructure improvements ahead of climate change, pending appropriations from the state government.\"If we go and we work on homes specifically, we'll have to look at the topography of certain areas, see if they've got a lot of flooding, try to invest in check valves or overhead plumbing,\" Spyropolous said, referring to valves that only let liquid flow through in one direction, which prevent contaminated water from reentering a domestic water supply, and domestic sewage systems that run a home's plumbing fixtures over the basement floor to a new sewer line to prevent flooding.She said the plan is to roll out the idea with a $400,000 pilot in Chatham, with potential expansion depending on its success.Spyropolous furthermore noted that work on the 50-year-old, multi-billion-dollar MWRD Deep Tunnel Project is ongoing: \"109 miles of intersecting tunnels and three reservoirs strategically placed throughout the county that take in about 22 million gallons.\"Four other Illinois Democrats, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, state Attorney General Kwame Raoul, state Treasurer Mike Frerichs and state Comptroller Susana Mendoza, won their primaries unopposed.Outgoing U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) won reelection to be the 1st congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman, and Southland state Rep. Will Davis (D-30th) won the election to be the 2nd congressional district\u2019s Democratic committeeman.Two local state legislators, Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) and Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), won their primaries unopposed and will face no opponents in November.\"I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to serve another term in the senate. I\u2019m excited to continue the fight for public safety for all and not a few in Springfield,\" Peters said in a statement.\"Over the last three years I\u2019ve been able to pass over 30 bills, move millions in violence prevention dollars and support millions in new infrastructure investment. This all happened due to my offices commitment to co-govern with constituents and advocates.\"I understand we are in extremely tense times nationally but I believe at the state level we can continue to push forward on lifting each other up and ensuring that our most in need get the support they deserve.\"As we head into the next few years we will need to keep Illinois at the forefront of progress against an ever more dangerous far right. I promise to be on the frontlines side by side with the district I represent.\"Buckner did not respond to a request for comment.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) also won unopposed and faces no opponent in November. He thanked voters in a statement and said he will continue to focus on economic equity, health care, mental health care and educational opportunities in the district, including trade and apprenticeship opportunities. He said he will also support the county's continuing efforts to reform its criminal justice system.\"Some specific goals include the return to a full-service emergency department at Provident Hospital, with ambulance access this coming fall, the 2023 renovation of Provident Hospital with a $240 million investment and the implementation of my 'Call to Action,'\" Lowry continued.\"Last week at my Peace Rally at Kenwood Academy, I issued a Call to Action to create a community center in every ward of Chicago. I called on elected at every level of government, faith leaders, community organizations, community members, not-for-profit entities and the business community to collaborate in this transformational effort. Such an effort will lessen violence today and present a pathway of opportunity and learning for generations to come. I eagerly look forward to my second term as Cook County commissioner of the 3rd district.\"Nowicki and Hancock reported from Springfield. Capitol News Illinois is a nonprofit, nonpartisan news service covering state government funded primarily by the Illinois Press Foundation and the Robert R. McCormick Foundation.a.gettinger@hpherald.comRepublican state Sen. Darren Bailey (55th), a conservative downstate farmer\u00a0first elected to the General Assembly in 2018, won a come-from-behind victory in his party's June 28 primary to take on Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker this fall.Former President Donald Trump endorsed his campaign late in the primary campaign, and he had received underhanded support from Pritzker and other Democrats, who repeatedly attacked him in advertisements for his right-wing bonafides and in so doing highlighted them to Republican primary voters.As the tides shifted toward Bailey in recent weeks, the GOP race's one-time frontrunner, Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin adopted a new line of attack, repeatedly saying \u201ca vote for Darren Bailey is a vote for JB Pritzker,\u201d arguing that the governor put his dollars behind Bailey because he judged him as the weakest candidate.Bailey earlier in the campaign didn\u2019t disagree with the take that Pritzker viewed him as a weak candidate, but he warned Pritzker to \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d He has stated his intent to reshape the state\u2019s GOP as a more conservative entity, including by endorsing primary challengers of incumbent Republican state lawmakers.Bailey\u2019s nomination sets up a general election contest pitting Pritzker\u2019s progressive track record against a candidate who is far to the right of previous leaders of the state\u2019s Republican party.Pritzker, meanwhile, has touted Illinois\u2019 firmer fiscal footing since he became governor, pointing to a $1 billion contribution to the state\u2019s \u201crainy day\u201d fund, an added $500 million pension payment beyond statutory levels and about $900 million spent to pay down other interest-accruing health insurance debts.State Rep. Dan Brady (105th), of Bloomington, won the GOP secretary of state nomination. He is a funeral director by profession who served as McLean County coroner from 1992 until he was elected to the Illinois House in 2000, rising to the post of assistant minority leader.Other GOP primary victors include Mundelein attorney Kathy Salvi, who will run against Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth in November, and lawyer Tom DeVore, the party's nominee for attorney general.\u00a0State Rep. Tom Demmer (90th) won the GOP primary for treasurer unopposed, as did certified public accountant Shannon Teresi, the party's nominee for comptroller.Eric Carlson, of Lemont, won the 1st congressional district's GOP primary. The Tribune reports that he was convicted of sexual assault in 1995 and spent six years in prison. Thomas Lynch, a member of the downstate Iroquois County Board, appears to have won the 2nd congressional district's GOP primary.Locally, 4th Ward GOP committeewoman Lori Yokoyama won her party's primary to run against state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th).ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner (D-26th) is running for mayor to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot from City Hall in 2023.\u00a0\"I'm a son of Chicago. I was born and raised in the city. The city is extremely important to me. It's given me everything that I have, and I understand the difficulties that I face,\" he said in an interview. \"But I'm also raising my son in Chicago, and I understand the opportunities that we have to make Chicago the city that she deserves to be.\"We have spent so much time recently fighting with each other, and we've not spent enough time fighting for our city, and I think we need visionary, transformative leadership to actually do that work.\"The Bronzeville-based state representative said some core issues his campaign will focus on are improving Chicago Public Schools and reducing crime. His legislative district spans the city\u2019s lakefront, including parts of Gold Coast, South Loop, Bronzeville, Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn and South Shore.The chairman of the Illinois Black Caucus kicked off his campaign this afternoon at the corner of 18th Street and Wabash Avenue before a crowd of dozens of supporters.\u201cWe cannot wait a day longer for a safe and just Chicago for all of us,\u201d he said, calling for more investment in schools and ways to give the city\u2019s children a path to success. \u201cWe need a mayor who can bring people together to get things done for Chicago.\u201dBuckner was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2019 to replace Christian Mitchell, who resigned to become deputy governor. Buckner was reelected in 2020 without opposition, and has supported legislation on firearm restrictions, renewable energy development and criminal justice reform.\u00a0\u00a0He is the grandson of a Baptist minister and the son of a sheriff's deputy sergeant and a public school teacher from Mississippi who was the first in her family to go to college. He grew up in Roseland; his first memory, as a three-year-old, was attending Mayor Harold Washington's wake in the Loop.If elected, Buckner would be the first mayor since Washington to be a Chicago Public Schools graduate. \"My matriculation through that district is going to be important to me as we make decisions on bringing the city forward on an educational standpoint,\" he said.After graduating from Morgan Park High School, Buckner studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he played defensive tackle for the Fighting Illini football team. He later got a degree from the DePaul University College of Law.Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, Buckner's professional background was split between sports business and nonprofits. He worked on the Wrigley Field renovations and served as executive director for the youth organization World Sport Chicago (born out of the city\u2019s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics). He was also a member of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Capitol Hill staff and worked for former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.Buckner said he has the executive experience to run a city of millions of people and a City Council with 50 alderpersons. \"It is also evident to me that it requires us to bring folks together and to be able to have conversations,\" he said. \"If you look at the work I've done in Springfield, it has really been highlighted by bringing people together.\"In Springfield, Buckner championed legislation allowing Illinois college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses and another bill this year that would ban \"ghost guns,\" firearms made from kits or 3D-printed without serial numbers. He was also a lead negotiator on Gov. J.B. Pritzker's landmark 2021 energy plan, which will force fossil fuel power plants offline by 2045, and put billions of dollars toward renewable and nuclear energy.A crowd claps for state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12Just before his campaign launch, Buckner said his proudest accomplishment has been the passage of legislation around the Black Caucus' pillars: criminal justice, economic access, education and health care.As chair of the caucus' House bloc, Buckner has been a vocal defender of the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which will end cash bail for the vast majority of crimes in Illinois next year and change use-of-force guidelines for law enforcement, create a new police certification system and expand detainee rights.The third candidate to announce a mayoral bid, Buckner is up against two other South Siders: millionaire businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, who also ran in 2019, and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th).As campaign season heats up, Buckner\u2019s opponents may bring up past personal mistakes; he has pleaded guilty twice to driving under the influence. The first occurred in 2010 in Urbana, after he graduated from college, and the second as a freshman legislator in 2019, when Springfield police officers found him asleep at the wheel a few blocks from the statehouse, the Tribune reported. He has since paid the fines and completed the community service required for the misdemeanors.Throughout his career Buckner has been outspoken on issues of policing and public safety. Early in May 2020, he reported on a police officer stopping him and demanding to see proof of purchase and identification after he left a South Loop retailer, saying that the officer said he \"looked like he was up to something.\"\u201cWhich begs the question, what does someone who is up to something look like?\u201d Buckner asked on Twitter. He recalled the talks young Black boys receive \"on how to maneuver a society that often looks at you as a threat first\" and a mentor who told him as a teenager to \"dress like a prospect and not a suspect.\"At today\u2019s campaign launch, Buckner continued: \u201cWhere you live should not determine if you live,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a Black kid from the South Side, I know what it\u2019s like to lie down on the wet pavement handcuffed because police officers think I fit a description.\"I'm a lifelong South Sider who has decided to remain a South Sider, and it's important to me that I bring all those experiences to bear in City Hall,\" he said. \"I bring all of that with me in this race and, hopefully, a Buckner administration.\"If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on February 28, the two frontrunners will have a runoff on April 4.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S.

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Leslie Hairston (5th) announced that she would retire at the end of this term\u2014her sixth. The seat is now vacant for the first time in 24 years and already has two contenders: journalist and community organizer Gabriel Piemonte, and former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode. Last week, Hairston told the Herald that she\u2019s unsure about whether or not to endorse a successor, though she\u2019s currently talking to announced and potential candidates.\u00a0Nearby, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) has committed to running for a fifth term, and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) has yet to announce a decision.

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

She is the first incumbent mayor to lose in Chicago since 1983. Four years ago, Hyde Park was the only community area she lost to her runoff opponent, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.The two local candidates, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Sophia King (4th), fell short, both garnering less than 2% of the vote.\u201cWe lead the pack on offering real concrete solutions, and it\u2019s my fervent hope that the next mayor of Chicago will put politics aside and collaborate with our communities, City Council and Springfield and Washington to make Chicago work better than it ever has,\u201d said Buckner in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expecting different results: we need both new approaches to policing and dedicated violence prevention funding and coordination across the city.\u201dKing, conceding at the Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S.

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

Pershing Road, where she endorsed his mayoral campaignThe upcoming February municipal election is one of the most consequential in Chicago\u2019s storied history. Our city is at a crossroads and it is imperative that we select a mayor that will provide strong, thoughtful and compassionate leadership. Brandon Johnson is my choice to make that happen.Brandon understands the approach necessary to face the many challenges facing Chicago. His tireless work as a community organizer, public school teacher and Cook County commissioner illustrates his deep commitment to our city and our many communities. His willingness to sit at the table with other leaders to find beneficial solutions through compromise is exactly the type of mayor we need during these dire times. Leadership is not a one way conversation with Brandon but a true dialogue.As alderman of the 3rd Ward I know my constituents expect and deserve effective leadership.

  "text": "Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st, left) and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul VallasReporterCook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st, left) and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul VallasCook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson (D-1st), the second-place finisher in the first round of the 2023 Chicago mayoral election, won a third of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood, while outgoing incumbent Lori Lightfoot won more than a quarter of the local vote.Those margins exceed their citywide tallies, Johnson at around 20% and Lightfoot\u2019s 17%. Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

She is the first incumbent mayor to lose in Chicago since 1983. Four years ago, Hyde Park was the only community area she lost to her runoff opponent, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.The two local candidates, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Sophia King (4th), fell short, both garnering less than 2% of the vote.\u201cWe lead the pack on offering real concrete solutions, and it\u2019s my fervent hope that the next mayor of Chicago will put politics aside and collaborate with our communities, City Council and Springfield and Washington to make Chicago work better than it ever has,\u201d said Buckner in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expecting different results: we need both new approaches to policing and dedicated violence prevention funding and coordination across the city.\u201dKing, conceding at the Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S.

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

Pershing Road, where she endorsed his mayoral campaignThe upcoming February municipal election is one of the most consequential in Chicago\u2019s storied history. Our city is at a crossroads and it is imperative that we select a mayor that will provide strong, thoughtful and compassionate leadership. Brandon Johnson is my choice to make that happen.Brandon understands the approach necessary to face the many challenges facing Chicago. His tireless work as a community organizer, public school teacher and Cook County commissioner illustrates his deep commitment to our city and our many communities. His willingness to sit at the table with other leaders to find beneficial solutions through compromise is exactly the type of mayor we need during these dire times. Leadership is not a one way conversation with Brandon but a true dialogue.As alderman of the 3rd Ward I know my constituents expect and deserve effective leadership.

Lamont Robinson (D-5th) has emerged as the frontrunner to succeed Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, having won every precinct in the ward in the Feb. 28 municipal election.His failure to clear 50%, however, means he will likely face the apparent second-place finisher Prentice Butler, King\u2019s chief of staff, in an April 4 runoff.Robinson won around 46% of the vote in six of the ward\u2019s precincts in Hyde Park and Kenwood south of 47th Street, just below his ward-wide margin. He appears to have won a majority of the vote in nine of the ward\u2019s 28 precincts.Butler, meanwhile, won almost 18% of the local vote, exceeding his 15% margin across the ward. Third-place finisher Ebony Lucas, a real estate attorney, trailed him ward-wide by less than a percentage point but only won a little less than 13% of the local vote.Separated by a margin of 60 votes, a second place finisher won\u2019t be officially announced until the remaining mail-in ballots are tallied up.Butler and Lucas both polled some of their highest margins in Kenwood. Lucas came in second place in several of the ward\u2019s precincts, but Butler beat her in five of the six in Hyde Park-Kenwood.The probable defeat marks Lucas\u2019 third in the 4th Ward. She lost to King in a 2017 special election after the alderwoman\u2019s appointment to City Council and again in 2019, when she was King\u2019s sole challenger. Lucas won a smaller percentage of the vote this year than she did in her previous two elections.5th Ward aldermanic runoff candidates Desmon Yancy and Martina \"Tina\" Hone.Tina Hone, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s former chief engagement officer and a Hyde Park resident, owes her ticket to the 5th Ward\u2019s runoff election to voters in the neighborhood.\u00a0The overall top vote-getter, South Shore community organizer Desmon Yancy, won a lower percentage of the vote in Hyde Park than he did across the ward, 26.1% versus 23.6%. He nevertheless bettered Hone\u2019s 22.7% margin in Hyde Park; Hone got 17.8% of the overall vote.Yancy, outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston\u2019s endorsee, nearly swept the ward\u2019s South Shore precincts, losing one in the Jackson Park Highlands to businessman Kris Levy by a single vote. (Levy came in seventh place overall, after Woodlawn activist Joshua Gray.)Three other Hyde Parkers, attorney Renita Ward, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode and Jocelyn Hare, who works at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris Policy Labs, came in third, fourth and fifth place in the neighborhood, winning 13.8%, 13.3% and 10.7%, respectively. Their ward-wide margins were 12.4%, 10.6% and 7.7%.Dee Perkins of South Shore, Marlene Fisher of Greater Grand Crossing, Gabriel Piemonte of Woodlawn and Robert Palmer of Greater Grand Crossing, finished out the pack. Piemonte, a former Herald editor, saw his support drop more than 20 points since the first round of the ward's 2019 aldermanic campaign in which he also ran. Palmer has twice been a candidate for Congress in Illinois\u2019 1st House district.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

She is the first incumbent mayor to lose in Chicago since 1983. Four years ago, Hyde Park was the only community area she lost to her runoff opponent, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.The two local candidates, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald.

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

It\u2019s been a truly grassroots experience. I\u2019ve never taken on something of this magnitude, and I\u2019m happy about what we've been able to achieve.\u00a0\u201cI look forward to reaching out to voters over the next couple of weeks to make my case why I believe I\u2019ve the best person to be the next alderperson of the 4th Ward.\u201dOn the edge of the lakefront,\u00a0the 4th Ward includes parts of South Loop, Bronzeville, Kenwood, Oakland and northern Hyde Park.

Calumet Ave., on Tuesday evening, Jan. 24, 2023.\u00a0Reporter(Left to right) 4th Ward aldermanic candidates Prentice Butler, Matthew \"Khari\" Humphries, Ebony Lucas,\u00a0Lamont Robinson, Tracey Bey and Helen West attend a forum at\u00a0Pershing Magnet School, 3200 S. Calumet Ave., on Tuesday evening, Jan. 24, 2023.\u00a0A Herald reporter audio-recorded a Jan. 31 4th Ward aldermanic forum after\u00a0misconstruing organizers' prohibition of taping during the proceedings. The Herald regrets the error.All six candidates running to be the 4th Ward\u2019s next alderperson agree that the top issue of the election is public safety, but they have different proposals and strengths to go about solving the problem.They met recently for two forums, on Jan. 24 and Jan. 31, both times in Bronzeville.The first 4th Ward forum of the campaign season drew all six candidates and more than 100 attendees to the auditorium of Pershing Magnet School, 3200 S. Calumet Ave. on Tuesday evening, Jan. 24.The candidates vying for outgoing Ald. Sophia King\u2019s seat are Tracey Bey, Prentice Butler, Matthew \"Khari\" Humphries, Ebony Lucas, Lamont Robinson and Helen West.The event was hosted by the 32nd Street Block Club, in collaboration with a coalition of other lakefront block clubs: 35th St., 39th St., 41st St. and 45 St. Event organizers focused conversation for the evening on public safety solutions, local developments and summer beach traffic congestion.Public safetyEach candidate listed improving public safety as a top priority in the ward, though they differed on approach.Bey, president of mortgage brokerage Bey Financial Corp and operations director for the nonprofit Ex-Cons for Community and Social Change (ECCSC), stressed the importance of violence interruption and intervention, saying that there is too much money spent in responding to crime and not enough in preventing it.She did say she supports hiring more police, and in the meantime ECCSC provides \u201ccommunity ambassadors\u201d in officers\u2019 places.Butler, Humphries and Robinson all noted their frequent meetings and relationships with local law enforcement.Outgoing 4th Ward Ald. Sophia King's chief of staff, Butler said he meets monthly with the commanders of the 1st and 2nd police districts. He also wants to utilize violence prevention strategies, including work with community ambassadors and violence interrupters.State Rep. Robinson (D-5th), who has more than 40 endorsements from elected officials and labor unions \u2013 among them Gov. JB Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle \u2014\u00a0promised to continue his ongoing monthly meetings with 3rd Ward Alderman Pat Dowell and Police Superintendent David Brown. He also said he supports expanding violence intervention programs.Similarly, Humphries, the city's senior director of Youth Policy, noted his experience coordinating with local police districts and administrative roles \u2014 he has spent his career working in nonprofits and community engagement, including a stint as director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago. In those roles, he's helped organize street outreach between law enforcement and youth to reduce crime.Lucas and Dr. West suggested more economic investment and investment in surveillance technologies could boost public safety.A real estate attorney, Lucas suggested creating a Real Time Crime Center, in which civilians could monitor public safety issues with surveillance technology and provide jobs to community members. In that vain, noting business closures in the ward and a need for more job creation, she stressed that economic investment and \"building a commercial corridor\" in Bronzeville would also improve public safety.West, a small business owner and educator, said she would purchase surveillance cameras and lighting with the ward's menu money.Lakefront traffic and beachgoer parkingA concern for many lakefront residents is the summer traffic congestion, lack of parking and litter caused by hundreds of daily beachgoers at 31st Street Beach.Bey said she would conduct more traffic and parking studies for the area, noting that projects like the more than 100-acre Bronzeville Lakefront redevelopment will likely exacerbate the problem.Robinson stressed that his office would \u2018hold the city and Park District accountable,\u2019 saying that there should be more ticketing of illegally parked cars and that the city could procure nearby vacant lots as overflow parking.Lucas suggested building a parking structure and Butler said that the beach should have locked gates and parking permits implemented.Notably, no candidate mentioned expanding public transportation as a means of mitigating traffic congestion.Public safety, housing and education were among the topics discussed at a second forum the following week at Hartzell United Methodist Church, 3330 S. King Dr.Public safetyLucas said that ensuring public safety means ensuring local police districts have the number of officers they're supposed to have alongside constant communication to civilians, including safety tips.Bey said she would empower other community organizations like ECCSC to do street interventions; she said life interventions targeting youth and adults would be \"getting to the root causes\" of crime, though she did not enumerate what the substance of those interventions would be. Robinson, meanwhile, said the next mayor and police superintendent need to reassess the officer placement strategy in the city and said more money should be going to crisis workers.Butler said the ward could better connect neighbors to each other as a means to combat crime. He said, for instance, that the creation of block clubs means the creation of a \"violence-prepared community\" that police respond to better, because they have a sense of what civilians need.West once again said that surveillance cameras are a deterrent and that the city should invest more in lighting and cameras. \"If you make a right turn when you shouldn't, you're going to get a ticket in the mail,\" said West.Housing and homelessnessRobinson stressed the need for city officials to work with organizations like the Quad Cities Development Corporation to build affordable housing throughout the ward. He said there needs to be work with banks to ensure residents get access to credit, both for homeownership and home repairs. He pointed to his legislative experience again, saying he could procure state and federal housing dollars.Butler noted his experience in the ward office connecting homeless people with shelters. He added that an alderman would need to work with multiple stakeholders and agencies to address the problem, such as mental health services providers. He also suggested building more affordable housing and that Chicago follow Houston's example of streamlining the process to get homeless people into apartments, not shelters, which has cut the number of homeless people in that metropolitan area 63% since 2011.\"We have to talk about leveraging the city-owned lots in our community to build affordable housing,\" he said.Humphries noted that he has been homeless, a resident of subsidized housing and a homeowner, saying that everyone should be able to have that trajectory. On top of strategies to foster affordable homeownership, he suggested the creation of single-room occupancy housing, an expansion of shelter beds and the development of Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) land.Lucas suggested reopening the mental health facilities the city closed in 2012 to combat homelessness; she also suggested that closed CPS school buildings be turned into shelters for people on the street, similar to how Wadsworth Elementary in Woodlawn is being used as a shelter for recently-arrived migrants and unhoused people.West suggested that there should be city subsidies to assist senior homeowners and assisted-living residents with expenses.EducationIn response to a question about digital literacy, Lucas, a former King College Prep local school council member, noted the schools in the ward that don't have adequate heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.She criticized the planned Near South High School to be built using, in part, tax-increment financing money from the ward at 2450 S. State St. Long-standing lobbying from Chinatown in part prompted the controversial Chicago Public Schools project, which will serve students from South Loop, Chinatown, Douglas and Bridgeport.\"Most of the schools already have a device for every child. But what they don't have is other basic things that allow the children to concentrate and focus,\" Lucas said.Robinson said there needs to be a focus on securing funding for other neighborhood schools in light of the Near South plans. He called himself the only candidate who understands the state budget and who will be able to bring \"much-needed resources\" to all schools. A City Colleges graduate and tutor at Kenwood Academy, he previously called for more links between the local schools and the resources of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago.Butler said that sustainability plans need to be drafted for Dunbar and Wendell Phillips high schools before New South construction begins \u2014 on land, he noted, that the CHA had promised would have another public housing complex to replace the Harold Ickes Homes, demolished more than a decade ago.\"We have to be holistic in this, as we look at education in our community \u2014 not just one shiny new school, but the schools that have a long history in this community, we need to make sure they are supported,\" he said.A previous version of this piece misstated that candidate Ebony Lucas is a King College Prep Local School Council member. She is a former LSC member.\u00a0Additional context to Lucas' statement on public safety in the Jan. 24 forum has also been added.The Herald regrets this error.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Desmon Yancy, South Shore police accountability activist, running for 5th Ward alderman",
  "text": "Desmon YancyReporterDesmon YancyOne of the public faces of the successful campaign to create an elected board for civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department, Desmon Yancy is running to be the next alderman of the 5th Ward.Yancy, who co-founded and is the spokesperson of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the subsequent Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) coalitions, has long been involved in work around police accountability and public safety.\"We've still got a long way to go in a city that's had issues around policing on paper since the 1960s and, with this current consent decree and the failures of the city to meet these deadlines, it's clear that it's a big boat to turn around,\u201d said Yancy. \u201cBut I'm happy to do my part.\"Born in the 8th Ward and a 1989 graduate from Kenwood Academy, Yancy is the son of a Chicago policeman who worked on Harold Washington\u2019s mayoral campaign and a mother who did medical billing and was an active volunteer with their church. After spending a year at DeVry University, he worked in sales and served in AmeriCorps VISTA, as a teacher's assistant at Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St., in the mid-1990s. He said the experience showed him the difficulties schools face when they are not adequately funded.In 2007, he got into union organizing with SEIU Healthcare and eventually created a program there that taught labor leadership and organizing.\"The gist of it was really to make sure that union workers could go home to their communities and provide the same leadership,\" Yancy said. \"When you're thinking about the housing crisis, when banks abandoned homes in formerly great neighborhoods, or fighting to raise the minimum wage across the city, these leaders played often-key roles in organizing their own community outside of the union work.\"He worked with SEIU until 2013, leading canvassing teams with the union in support of both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in Chicago, Northwest Indiana and Wisconsin. In 2014, he worked on a local voter registration project with 13 coalition partners, which he described as both challenging and \"a first taste of how important it is for organizations to work across the city in order to have change.\"Following the police murder and coverup of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in fall 2014, a coalition of community organizations came together to form Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability in 2016. Yancy was a co-founding member of the coalition, and would become its policy coordinator.Over the years GAPA, in partnership with groups like the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), other public safety coalitions and community organizations, would push for the City Council to create a platform for civilian oversight of the police. In July 2021, City Council created the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and 22 district councils, elected for each of the city\u2019s police districts.\"A lot of it was 'slow and steady winning the race' and being true to your convictions, especially when we ran up against opposition from Mayor Lightfoot,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cShe was fully in support of our proposal for police oversight in Chicago and then at a point got cold feet, because she thought that district councils would have too much power\u2026 But we stayed true to what we felt was really a key principle of the work that we were doing, which was transparency and accountability.\u201dShould he be elected alderman, Yancy would like to push the city towards creating more policy accountability and oversight, which he said is still lacking even after the commission and councils' creation. He named outgoing Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th), Roderick Sawyer (6th) and Harry Osterman (48th) as well as Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and North Side Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) as particularly hard workers behind the July 2021 measure. But Yancy said more needs to be done to support it behind the scenes.\"Like I said, I'm the son of a police officer, but at the same time I've been working on police accountability for the last six years,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cI certainly understand the work that needs to be done and look forward to being able to support that work on council.\"Lightfoot appointed seven interim commissioners in August; Yancy said he has been working with them to develop talking points about issues like the police budget. He said the interim CCPSA is looking to make an immediate impact. It will eventually play a role in hiring and removing a police superintendent, Police Board members and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) chief administrator, as well as approving departmental general orders, enacting its own policies and supervising the department, COPA and the Police Board.Asked how he would work with law enforcement in the 5th Ward, Yancy noted that he worked with the CPD in passing the oversight ordinance. \"Those conversations aren't easy, but they're important,\" he said. \"It's a slow process to get the police department bought into police reform efforts.\"He said police are largely responding to rhetoric like \"defund the police\" but he can work with them, with his personal background and his perspective that law enforcement is a partner in public safety that should not be othered.Neighborhood safety \u2014 residents' safety and police officers' safety \u2014 should be paramount as individuals in either group do not currently feel safe, Yancy said.\"It is helpful when police officers hear issues from people who have families deeply impacted by police misconduct,\" he said. \"One officer I was talking to who was in leadership at the time told me about how he, as a teenager, was assaulted by a police officer, which motivated him to become a police officer.\u201cThere's more to it, and as long as we look at it from our polls and don't look at it in terms of what the actual goal is, which is public safety, then we're going to have a much more difficult time.\"He wants to have the authority of an aldermanic office to motivate those conversations with more people, to do away with fear and build community support \"for the right efforts.\"Yancy is currently directing organizing and advocacy for the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, overseeing and facilitating the organization's policy and advocacy agenda. He continues to live in South Shore and is the father of an 8 year old.Promontory Point is one of their favorite places to walk, and Yancy is concerned about South Shore lakefront property owners affected by the lake's erosion and flooding. He called Hairston's July-passed South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance, \"a great start.\" He said more programs like it are needed, especially ones that are easily accessible to everyday people.Asked about constituent services, Yancy talked about modernizing the 5th Ward office. He would seek to hire young staffers to engage youth around things like political education, aiming to decrease distrust in government, as well as longtime 5th Ward residents, to add credibility to the office. He also talked of creating an \"office-on-wheels\" to bring constituent services to all four neighborhoods the ward covers.\"There's some level-setting that needs to be done with constituents,\" he said, setting the goal to under-promise and over-deliver. \"I think there are many constituents who think that alderpeople have particular power in their wards that they don't.\"Hyde Park's commercial corridors look different than South Shore's, which are beset by empty lots. \"As we look at that and look at the lack of employment, there's a direct correlation,\" he said. \"I would love to see grants or funding to small businesses, to capitalize them.\"As construction continues on the Obama Presidential Center, Yancy said he would like to see a mix of national and local businesses flourish along Stony Island Avenue, similar to 53rd Street's commercial mixture.\"I would just love for South Shore, Woodlawn and Greater Grand Crossing to feel like the same sort of community,\" he said. \"I know it's not anything that's going to be achieved in one, two or even three terms. However, I think setting the groundwork legislatively to ensure that those funds are there to capitalize businesses, offer some business support and use the weight of the office to encourage economic development will be important.\"Yancy wants to ensure the ward is attractive to new families and college graduates as well as longtime residents. He called for a balance between affordable housing and transit-oriented developments to curb runaway inflation in housing costs. He would like to see something like Hairston and Taylor's Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance for South Shore.Mental health is another issue of importance to Yancy. He said more resources should go into homelessness prevention, particularly in Woodlawn and South Shore. That call for equity would also include funneling resources to the ward's schools, so that, as he put it, Revere Elementary School, 1010 E. 72nd St., and Murray Language Academy, 5335 S. Kenwood Ave., could perform at the same level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th)ReporterAlds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th)The City Council Committee on Public Safety has voted down the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified bans on no-knock warrants and other sweeping changes to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s search and raid policies.\u00a0The committee voted 4-10 to reject the ordinance in a Nov. 10 hearing, despite the testimony of its namesake at the meeting.Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th), a committee member, introduced the ordinance in February 2021 with the backing of the other Black women in the council\u2019s Progressive Reform Caucus, including local Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th).The ordinance was introduced after a botched raid that affected social worker Anjanette Young in 2019. During the raid, multiple male officers entered her house incorrectly on a no-knock warrant while she was nude, ignoring her protests that they had the wrong location for 40 minutes. (The council approved a $2.9 million settlement for her last December after national outcry that the city was stonewalling its recompense.)\"Do the right thing,\" Young said at the November hearing, recounting the continuing mental health harm that the raid has caused. After the loss, Young told reporters that the fight would continue until the ordinance passes.In March 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CPD leadership introduced policy changes requiring teams of officers to identify any potentially vulnerable people like children who may be at a site where they have a warrant. Guns are not to be pointed at children. Investigations leading to warrants must be documented. Warrants also require independent investigations to verify that information used to obtain them are accurate, with a review for wrong raids.\u00a0No-knock warrants are banned unless lives or safety are in danger; the Sun-Times reports that their use has been \u201csignificantly limited.\u201dWest Side Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th) opposed the ordinance but fulfilled his 2021 promise of letting it come up for a vote before the committee he chairs.The Lightfoot administration argued against the ordinance, saying the CPD policy reforms were enough and that the federal consent decree monitors wrong and flawed raids. Hadden and University of Chicago Law School Professor Craig Futterman dismissed this, saying that the consent decree did not conflict with the ordinance.After the hearing, Taylor, who is not on the committee but attended its meeting, said that the vote showed that some alderpersons \"have not learned anything\" despite the reckoning that the nation has endured over race and police violence since 2020.\"They don't care about anything, and they definitely don't care about the people they represent. And they're not thinking about accountability,\" Taylor said. \"This is not me hating the police. This is not you being disrespectful to the people who are paid to serve and protect us. This lady is clearly telling you, as a social worker, what she's been through, how the city hasn't contacted her for any services or anything.\u201d\"They don't care,\" she repeated. \"This is why the police get to do what they do. This is why they get away with stuff, because they're not held accountable. They're made to be seen like they're above the law.\"Taylor discounted the CPD warrant policy changes, saying they did not meet the gravity of the moment and that police accountability promises are repeatedly broken. She said she could have called parents to testify about the police raids conducted in their homes in front of young children.\"We would have been devastated to hear how those young people feel. But we don't do that, because we don't want to know the truth,\" she said.The ordinance would have required a 30-second wait for police before they entered after knocking and for them to avoid with \"all available measures\" executing a warrant when children younger than 16 were present. Police would not be able to handcuff or point guns at children, and they would not be able to restrain or handcuff their parents or guardians unless they were immediately presenting a threat of physical harm. Pointing guns at adults would have been prohibited unless the target was an imminent threat of death or injury.The alderwoman is running for reelection next year and said she will continue advocating for the ordinance.\"I will never stop fighting for change. What am I here for? I could have stayed a community organizer,\" Taylor said. \"The fact that I have to fight with my coworkers for what is right in and around these communities is a problem.\"Looking ahead to the 2023 mayoral election, Taylor said she wants a mayor who is open to dialogue, conversation and collaboration with alderpersons: \"I want a person who will sit down with us and compromise.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (9th) chairing the Nov. 9 City Council Education Committee meetingThis story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.Some Chicago alderpersons want school district officials to meet with City Council quarterly, but a proposal to make that happen failed to pass Wednesday, Nov. 9.Under the ordinance, the measure would have temporarily withheld city money for certain school projects if Chicago Public Schools officials didn\u2019t show up. That turned out to be a deal breaker for many aldermen on the committee, which held a virtual meeting Wednesday.The vote was tied \u2014 and therefore, failed \u2014 with seven voting in favor and seven voting against.\u201cI currently have three projects in the hopper and I don\u2019t want to get in the way of my own best interest,\u201d said Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza (10th), a former school counselor and Chicago Teachers Union member. She said quarterly meetings are \u201cnot a huge ask.\u201dAld. Sophia King (4th), who is running for mayor, put forward the ordinance during a committee meeting after being frustrated with the district\u2019s lack of response to her budget questions.\u201cThe threats of resources being withheld could very easily be waylaid, if CPS would just show up,\u201d King said, noting that she reached out to district chief Pedro Martinez \u201cquietly and subtly\u201d to try to get questions answered about the school district\u2019s budget \u201cto no avail.\u201dChuck Swirsky, senior advisor to Martinez, called it a \u201charmful ordinance\u201d that would jeopardize school construction and infrastructure projects.\u201cYou have our numbers, and we answer each time you call and I mean no matter what time of day it is,\u201d Swirsky said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly value the genuine relationships and partnerships that we have fostered with City Council members.\u201dBut Chicago Public Schools officials rarely appear before aldermen in public meetings. The Committee on Education and Child Development also rarely meets, despite attempts by council members to call meetings.It was the first time King led a meeting as the vice chair of the Committee on Education and Child Development, which has been without a leader since June when Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th) resigned to take a job in the private sector. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has since appointed Scott to the school board and attempted to appoint an ally and bypass King.The discussion comes after a report, prepared by the district with help from a consulting firm, released last week outlined the costs the city could shift to the school district once it transitions to an elected school board. It outlines hypothetical cost shifts on everything from school construction funding to water bills to summer programs.The city already started shifting costs to Chicago Public Schools in 2020 when it started requiring the school district to pay into a city pension fund that covers some school employees.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

Leslie Hairston (5th, right) speaks to Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd, left), chair of the City Council Budget Committee, and Ald. Sophia King (4th), Monday, Nov. 7On Monday, Chicago City Council voted 32-18 to pass Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s $16.4 billion 2023 budget. Like the City Council, local alderwomen were divided.Alds. Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th) both voted to pass the budget at the Nov. 7 City Council meeting, while Ald. Sophia King (4th), who is challenging Lightfoot for her mayoral seat in February, voted against.\u00a0The council also narrowly voted 29-21 to pass the mayor\u2019s property tax levy, which does not include a property tax hike to keep up with the rate of inflation, which Lightfoot had initially proposed in September.Notably, it's the first of Lightfoot's budgets Taylor has supported and the last budget Hairston will have voted on before ending her 24-year aldermanic career.King, speaking from the council floor, agreed with the budget\u2019s supporters that there were good things included in it, namely hundreds of millions to pay down the city's pension debt and for housing, but said it fell short on meeting the city\u2019s priorities, specifically public safety.\"I do not think that this budget addresses gun violence in a significant way,\" King said, noting an allocation of $85 million last year towards public safety, most of which has not been spent by Lightfoot\u2019s administration.Only $5 million of that $85 million in the last budget has been spent. King said alderpersons have asked the administration for details about anti-violence spending but have received none in turn. (She suggested the city spend $200 million on those efforts.) She said she herself has asked for more information about city funding for Chicago Public Schools but has received none.King said there should be money set aside for jobs training for young men of color, trauma-informed care and non-police responses to certain mental health 9-1-1 calls for service \u2014 all anti-violence initiatives \u2014 but that there is none. And she complained, alongside other alderpersons, that no Department of the Environment would be established in this time of climate change, something the mayor had campaigned on creating in 2019.\"This budget is not equitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThe resources, especially this year in our budget, spent towards African American contracting is down.\"\"Even low-hanging fruit, like having blocks in Black and brown communities just be clean \u2014 those are our city blocks..\"Taylor, for her part, said she was happy to see Black organizations get anti-HIV funding and to get an assurance that the Chicago Torture Justice Center, a Woodlawn nonprofit borne out of the city's history of police torture that plans a memorial for its victims, will get $250,000 in funding.\"They would raise $2 million \u2014 I got that in writing,\" Taylor said of the city's promises, adding that she was also happy to see no rise in the city's property taxes. But she still said that the city needed to do a better job in equitably funding street repairs in her ward and others like it, observing that South Side wards are bigger than North Side ones, due to lower population density, though funding levels do not recognize these physically larger areas.\u00a0As alderpersons pontificated on the floor before the vote, Hairston claimed in an interview that \"a lot of the comments being made are being made by people who didn't actually attend the budget hearings (and) did not submit amendments to the budget.\"Hairston said she has worked to get a transfer of the $15 million the city allocated in July for at-risk and in-need-of-repairs South Shore condominiums and co-ops.\u00a0\"Anybody can hold a press conference and say something. Actually getting it done is different,\" she said. \"The work is at the beginning, the middle and the end to make sure that everything is tied up to make sure that it actually happens.\"Hairston actually voted against the budget in committee last month and said her vote was motivated by the city making efforts to fix long-identified infrastructural issues in the 5th Ward. \"That doesn't discount the rest of the budget,\" she said.Despite the divided vote, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), who chairs council's Budget Committee, received widespread acclaim from her peers at council for her leadership during the process.In her statement after its passage, Lightfoot praised the city's continued ratings upgrades from Fitch, purchasing of hundreds more emergency vehicles and millions of dollars for new police equipment, station renovations and public safety cameras. The budget ups the Chicago Police Department funding by $64 million to nearly $2 billion.While a Department of the Environment was not established, an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity was with $1 million in funding. Lightfoot's administration has proposed reviving the Department of the Environment in the coming years.More than $200 million is going to homelessness support services, including the construction of \"supportive\" housing and housing programs. Nearly $90 million was allocated for mental health services. The city has paid down $747 million in its outstanding debt.\u00a0\u201cOver the past three years, we have steered our city through some challenging fiscal storms,\u201d said Lightfoot in the statement. \u201cHowever, each and every time, we came together to collaborate on how to enhance the quality of life for all of our residents, and emerged to become the stronger, more vibrant city that we are today. This budget is a reflection of our hard work and values.\u201dIn her speech to council, Lightfoot said that $2 billion will have been made in economic development programs by the end of the year, touting her Invest South/West initiative.\"From streetscapes to vertical construction, retail, health care, affordable housing, community gathering spaces, and more, these are transformative, catalytic investments,\" she said. \"When we raise the fortunes of the South and West sides, we raise the fortunes of the entire City.\"At the post-council press conference, Cecilia Cuff, co-owned of the Bronzeville Winery, 4420 S. Cottage Grove Ave. in the Invest South/West 4400 Grove project, praised the mayor for her investments. (The winery received city funding.)\"I'm sure that funding like the Invest South/West initiatives has acted, for other businesses across Chicago, like a springboard,\" she said, praising the public-private partnership for the confidence it gives entrepreneurs and the additional capital it attracts from banks.\u00a0Without it, Cuff said it would have been hard to find funding for \"a space that doesn't seem like it's investment-worthy.\" And she praised the city for improving the neighborhood by developing businesses \u2014 ones where local workers can get paid a good wage in their own community.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallReporterChicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallYouth anti-violence group Good Kids Mad City (GKMC) filed a federal lawsuit seeking to lift the city\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew for minors on Halloween night. The organization filed the suit so that young activists with the group \u2013 many are younger than 18 \u2013 can safely observe the police and try to keep the peace as they monitor the expected crowds of teenagers who come to 53rd Street every holiday.But at an Oct. 27 press conference, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown said the curfew is unlikely to apply to the GKMC volunteers, as their actions are protected under the ordinance, which includes a protection for youth out past curfew who are engaged in First Amendment activities.\"There's plenty of opportunity in the ordinance itself for them to do exactly what they're saying they want to do,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'll let the court and the lawyers decide it, but there's nothing that prevents people who are active and engaged (from) staffing events from being out in the city. The curfew ordinance doesn't stop that.\"The ordinance, which passed City Council on May 25 of this year, does not apply to minors \"participating in, or returning home immediately after, a ticketed or sponsored event and has documentary evidence of their attendance,\" such as a ticket stub or wristband.\u00a0Minors are also protected if they are expressing their constitutional First Amendment rights, including assembly and the freedom of speech.The lawsuit, however, states, \"Despite the existence of a First Amendment affirmative defense, the text of the ordinance provides no guidance for how a CPD officer should evaluate whether a young person is engaging in First Amendment activity.\u201d\u00a0Per the ordinance a CPD officer can choose to enforce the curfew if they reasonably believe \u2018'that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other circumstances, no defense is present.'\u2019The lawsuit further cites the special order CPD issued after the curfew time was changed, which states that an officer can issue curfew violations when an \u201cofficer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred\" absent the aforementioned protections for youth who were at events or engaged in First Amendment activities. (A carveout for youth commuting to or from work also exists.)The GKMC lawsuit argues that the CPD special order does not give officers a clear process for \"recognizing, inquiring about, and/or analyzing First Amendment activity.\"Activists from GKMC and other organizations like the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights have monitored Halloween in Hyde Park for the past several years. Oct. 31 has seen rowdy crowds of youth come to the neighborhood since 2016. Halloween night in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 saw violence, property damage and arrests; the nights of 2020 and 2021 did not see arrests and were altogether less violent than the previous years.Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) began meeting with the police department-wide leadership as well as the local 2nd District, 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., and the University of Chicago Police Department to craft a less-heavy-handed law enforcement response to the youth disorder. Police began wearing, for instance, regular uniforms instead of tactical gear while patrolling in the neighborhood that night.A key development in the neighborhood has been the \"Collabooration\" effort that began in 2019 and aims to have Hyde Parkers out in front of their homes so that a good-willed and watchful public presence will defuse chaos before it starts. Its founder, local financial planner Bennie Currie, spoke at the press conference.\"We're building community block-by-block,\" he said. \"We have 25 blocks that we call 'activated' in Hyde Park. People like myself in orange shirts are block-activators, and they will be making sure that our residents are Halloween night are being very hospitable, that they have the lights on.\"\u00a0Currie pointed to the planned increased presence on 53rd itself, acknowledging that many of the youth there on Halloween night are from other South Side neighborhoods who come to Hyde Park because of its relative safety.Brown said there will be more officers deployed citywide this weekend than in the past. He said that the response in Hyde Park this year will be similarly collaborative, saying, \"I will point back to the last couple of years, where we've collaborated with Hyde Park and all the stakeholders (and Collabooration).\"\"It cannot be a police-only solution to community safety,\" he said. \"We'll be obviously much more visible and present in collaboration with all those celebrations. We'll be present at the celebrations, where we've been having gatherings, as well as with increased patrols.\"\"Police cannot resolve community safety alone. We need you,\" Brown said. \"We want everyone to have fun. We want you to enjoy being out. But we also want you to be safe.\"After the press conference, Currie said the police do not plan to have a line of patrol cars with blue lights lit up this year and noted that GKMC is partnering with Collabooration this year.\"We're just trying to make sure that we have people doing what we want them to do, to be welcoming and to be giving things to kids and celebrating, creating an atmosphere. And that's really what our focus is,\" he said. \"(Police) told us if something happens, yeah, the blue lights will be on, and I would greatly appreciate that.\u00a0\"But in terms of how they handle the curfew, that's not really what I'm focused on,\" Currie said, noting that most youth are out of the neighborhood by 10 p.m. anyway.The city's online resource with holiday safety tips and activities is chicagohalloweek.org.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) talks to reporters during the Oct. 26 City Council meetingMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at an Oct. 26 press conferenceOct. 28 \u2014 This article has been updated to mention that Ald. Sophia King (4th) has set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.City Council rejected by a 29-18 vote an attempt by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to install Uptown Ald. James Cappleman (46th) to head the Committee on Education in its Oct. 26 meeting.\u00a0The proposed appointment bypassed Ald. Sophia King (4th), the vice chair of the committee and acting chair following the June resignation of its previous chair, former West Side Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th). King is running against Lightfoot in next year\u2019s mayoral electionFollowing the resolution\u2019s swift rejection by City Council, King rose to speak, criticizing the vote and the mayor. She also said her repeated requests for Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez to appear before City Council have been ignored.\"This is exactly what people don't want,\" King said. \"You know and I know that I've been asking the CEO of Chicago Public Schools to meet, to have quarterly meetings. That\u2019s 'bringing in the light.' That\u2019s transparency.\u00a0You saw with my colleagues today, they would like to have him come here, because we contribute millions of dollars every year.\"I didn't want to turn it into politics, but that's what it is right now. We really need to have a transparent government where we allow folks to understand and hear from one of the most important bodies in our city, and that's Chicago Public Schools.\"King identified herself as acting chair of the committee and said she assumed that Martinez was not returning her calls upon Lightfoot\u2019s orders.\u00a0Lightfoot in turn denied any knowledge of King's contact with Martinez, admonishing King for speaking about \"what is clearly a political issue for you.\"King said in turn that she had communicated with Lightfoot and her chief of staff over her request, adding, \"Quite frankly, if you would spend more time attacking problems than people, we\u2019d all be better off.\"Lightfoot ruled her out of order, saying that they could talk about the issue but that a council meeting was not the time nor place for it.In an exchange with reporters after the vote, King called the council rejecting the mayor's appointment of Cappleman \"a referendum on her leadership.\u201d She said she has been reaching out to CPS leadership for a date on which the CEO and his administration could report to alderpersons about the state of the district.Changing committee chairs is Lightfoot's administration's attempt to block transparency, King alleged, pointing out the dearth of Education Committee meetings. The committee had only met seven times between May 2019 and April 2022 despite an annual $175,000 budget, Crain's, The Daily Line and WBEZ reported.King had asked Lightfoot to be named chair of the Education Committee in May, after Scott announced his pending resignation. The alderwoman called the mayor's attempted appointment of a new chair \"retribution\" for her attempt to schedule a committee meeting with the CPS leadership.\"It wasn't a political speech. It's true,\" King said. \"I said exactly what people are thinking, that, if this mayor spent the same amount of time that she spends attacking people attacking problems (instead), our city would be much better off.\"In her post-council meeting press conference, Lightfoot said the rejection of her choice for committee chair, an uncommon occurrence, \"is a reflection of the politics that we live in right now.\" She noted that Cappleman, like King, has experience as a teacher and said he has her full confidence.\u00a0\"What happened was politics at work, but we've got to get back to do the business of the people,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'm confident that we will get him approved as Education chair.\"Asked if the council's rejection of Cappleman was less about the alderman and more about the process through which Lightfoot tried to appoint him, Lightfoot incorrectly said her appointment had cleared the Rules Committee the day before.In an interview before the press conference, South Side Ald. Michelle Harris (8th), the Rules Committee chair and mayor's floor leader, whose ward covers a section of South Shore, said the mayor's would-be appointment was directly introduced to the full council, not the Rules Committee.\u00a0\"Generally, every mayor since I've been here for 16 years has introduced their chairmen through this process,\" she said. She said whether she agreed with the process means less than her belief \"that mayors have the right to put in leaders of their choice.\"Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) also voted against the appointment. Ald Leslie Hairston (5th) was not at the council meeting because she is on jury duty.King and Lightfoot have clashed during a council meeting before, in May 2021, when the mayor ruled her out of order as she attempted to call a vote on her proposal to rename Lake Shore Drive for Chicago\u2019s founder, Haiti-born trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. A compromise was reached the next month, renaming the expressway DuSable Lake Shore Drive.On Friday, King set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "State Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)ReporterState Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) is running to replace Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, leaning into his experience as a two-term state legislator and work in the private sector as an insurance salesman and former adjunct business professor.\"I'm hoping to take my statewide experience to the City Council to continue to improve the safety, equity and wellbeing of my local neighbors in the 4th Ward,\" he said in an interview. \"I see that there's a void in my community by Sophia King running for mayor, and I want to be able to fill that void.\"Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's 4th Ward Democratic Organization has endorsed his candidacy.In terms of his track record in elected office, which he\u2019s held since 2018, Robinson is proudest of his advocacy to save Mercy Hospital, now called Insight Hospital and Medical Center Chicago, 2525 S. Michigan Ave. He also noted his legislation to remove lead pipes across the state with a requirement for minority-owned firms to do at least 11% of the contracts, as well as work to secure resources for public safety and to build centers for seniors, LGBTQ people and job-workforce development in his district.Robinson's district runs from River North down through the Loop, South Loop, Bronzeville and Washington Park, with a portion of South Shore. The 4th Ward runs along the lakefront from South Loop to 53rd Street in Hyde Park.If elected, Robinson would be the first openly gay Black male alderman and the second over all, after Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).Mercy Hospital\u00a0Robinson said he brought community groups, labor unions and religious organizations together to protest the planned closing of Mercy Hospital.Its former owner had reported millions of dollars in monthly losses and capital serious needs; the Insight Chicago nonprofit in turn promised to run the facility as a teaching and community hospital through at least 2029 after purchasing it for $1.\"We were out there for a year protesting, in the rain, sleet, snow,\" he said. \"I was at the forefront of that. I pulled together my neighbors; I pulled together the faith-based community; I pulled together the unions. And we kept that in the news, and there was national attention we got on that closure. And we were able to keep it open. Jobs were saved, and we don't have a health care desert in my community.\"Lead pipesRobinson's Lead Service Line Replacement and Notification Act establishes a Lead Service Line Replacement Fund administered by the Illinois Environmental Replacement Agency. It became law on Jan. 1 and requires owners and operators of community water supplies to develop an inventory of lead water service lines and implement a replacement plan. Chicago has reported 522,571 lead connections.The federal government's bipartisan infrastructure plan includes $15 billion to replace lead pipes nationwide. The Chicago Department of Water Management is accepting applications to replace lead service pipes for households with income below 80% of the area median income ($83,350 for a family of four) or for homeowner occupants, noting the high likelihood of houses and two-flats built before 1986 having lead water service lines. (More information is available at leadsafechicago.org.)Progress in Chicago has been slow, however, with WTTW reporting last month that less than half of 1% of 400,000 service lines, 154, have been replaced, though Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration said the city would remove 650 pipes by the end of last year through $15 million in federal grants.Robinson said he wants to be on City Council to spearhead efforts to replace the lines, adding that he has worked with Illinois U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth to procure federal resources.\u00a0Community centersRobinson pointed to the lack of a Chicago Senior Center in the mid-South Side and the number of seniors who live in the ward. \"I was able to secure $10 million for that effort,\" he said.\u00a0Site-selection is ongoing, as it is for the job-workforce center that is to run with the nonprofit Community Assistance Programs employment agency, 11717 S. Halsted St. He said it will be in Bronzeville and do workforce development in services and trades. It will also have a housing component akin to college dormitories, though there will be no age cap.Robinson also got funds for a to-be-built South Side LGBTQ community center, to be run with Howard Brown Health.He noted the millions of dollars in violence-prevention money he got from the state for the South Side, saying, \"That money has been out, and it has been in the hands of community-based organizations.\"\u00a0Public safety\u00a0According to Robinson, gang, drug and gambling activity is still common on 35th Street due to a lack of police engagement, namely giving out tickets and visiting local businesses. He said that is changing, though because of meetings with the area's alderwomen and Chicago Police Department leadership. Arrests and officer patrols are up.\"That's what we need to do on all the retail corridors in the 4th Ward,\" he said. \"I look forward to continuing to work with police to ensure that we have a safe community, but I think it's also important that we can close these gaps around violence when we engage the community \u2014 when we come together and make sure that we're calling 9-1-1 and reporting incidents.\"To ensure a bigger police presence would not lead to over-policing or racist incidents, Robinson highlighted the importance of community policing: having the same officers assigned to a corridor so that they can know residents and businesses.\u00a0More resources are needed. If elected, he said he would like to see greater utilization of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago's resources, especially their surveillance cameras and police forces.\"We look at Bronzeville, at 35th Street \u2014 there are local businesses there, and we need to make sure that we bring in new businesses, that folks are able to walk that retail corridor and feel safe, \" Robinson said. \"I think that that is needed because we haven't been able to see the needle move with respect to 35th Street.\"The 35th Street corridor does not have a special service area, the city's business improvement districts that use local tax revenue for beautification and to attract new developments. (SSA #61, aka Downtown Hyde Park, covers the 53rd Street corridor in coordination with the South East Chicago Commission.)\u00a0Robinson was a commissioner on SSA #47, on 43rd and 47th streets and Cottage Grove Avenue, which runs with Quad Cities Development Corporation (QCDC), 4210 S. Berkeley Ave., and claimed the 2014-opened Shops & Lofts at 47, 747 E. 47th St., as an accomplishment. Bringing in retail and affordable housing and removing blight is the goal on 35th. He also wants to advocate for the Chicago Park District to clean up its local properties after events.Robinson began his Allstate insurance agency\u00a0on 47th Street in Kenwood in 2007. (It's now at 5050 S. Indiana Ave.) He joined QCDC\u2019s board in 2009. He said he could utilize the relations he has as a state representative with large corporations in Illinois as an alderman.\u00a0He spent eight years at Kenwood Academy running the Kappa Leadership Institute mentoring program, which he said has sent hundreds of young men from Chicago high schools to college nationwide, and he taught business at Harold Washington College.Education is important to him, and he wants to work for the ward's schools from Printer's Row to Hyde Park. That means boosting neighborhood schools to attract students and projecting safety around them, which he called his ultimate responsibility.\u00a0\"As the current state rep., I have met with all of my neighborhood schools. And I look to continue doing that work as an alderman,\" he said. \"We can lean on Chicago Public Schools to give us those resources, or we can go out and get those resources ourselves.\"When King College Prep, 4445 S. Drexel Blvd., needed iPads, he connected the principal to Apple. He liaised the school leadership with the U. of C. to help it establish a health care and engineering education track.He runs his district office, 5048 S. Indiana Ave., with three dedicated staffers, including one who works on senior services, and interns from the U. of C. They phone banked seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic to gauge their needs, including food deliveries, and direct them to testing.\u00a0Should he be elected, he said he would bring his three staffers to run his ward office and work to create an app to inform constituents of goings-on in the ward and take in service requests. He said he would gain constituent feedback from coffee meetings across the ward.\u00a0\"I've been accessible as a state rep.; I'm going to be accessible as an alderman. I think that those are the things that people need to see (so they) want to stay in the 4th Ward and move into the 4th Ward,\" he said.\u00a0Robinson said he wants \"to put the community in the center of all decisions,\" including polling them to see what kind of housing and commercial developments they want. In addition to a local affordable housing shortage, he pointed to a shortage of local affordable commercial space. He would continue engaging with the advisory board associated with the development of the Michael Reese Hospital site and wants himself to get more information about the project's timeline.Working as a state legislator and liaising with various state departments would benefit his work as an alderman, particularly in terms of getting potholes filled. Being able to get the state to clean up the Dan Ryan Expressway would be similar to fostering clean-up efforts on King Drive or Cottage Grove.He said his personal background enables him to understand how marginalized people feel voiceless and the need to advocate for them in government. He nearly lost his business during the Great Recession and seeing it endure today is a testament to his work ethic and will to do whatever it takes to be successful \u2014 qualities he brings to his legislative work and would bring to the job as alderman.Robinson grew up in Chatham, the son of a public schoolteacher and a building inspector who died when he was 17. He attended Mount Carmel High School, Clark Atlanta University and National Louis University, where he earned a master's degree in business administration.He has a partner of 13 years who also sells insurance. Should he be elected, Robinson said his partner would continue running the business and that he would still work there, saying that the arrangement has not led to conflicts of interest in Springfield.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King's (4th) newly released public safety platform calls for firing incumbent police Superintendent David Brown and hiring hundreds of retired officers and detectives to, respectively, do non-dangerous duties and improve the city's crime clearance rate.She would also turn back many of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's law enforcement initiatives, namely her establishment of citywide task force units, and return the 875 officers involved to full-time neighborhood patrols.King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0That proposal is similar to recent state action, including an Illinois Office of Firearm Violence Prevention that coordinates with and funds anti-violence community organizations. King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0While some studies question the effectiveness of violence interrupters at preventing community violence, King said funding violence intervention programs \"at scale\" would be more preventative.Similar to the state's creation of a mental health first-responder system in coordination with the federal government's new 9-8-8 number that connects to suicide and crisis hotlines, King also calls for expanding responses to substance abuse-, mental health- and extreme poverty-related 9-1-1 calls that would provide non-law enforcement responses to nonviolent situations. (The city, meanwhile, began programs piloting mental health responses to emergency calls last year.)As more surveillance cameras have been installed throughout Hyde Park in response to a spate of violent crime last year, King proposes to do the same citywide, claiming that they and drones would be useful when physical pursuits or investigations could be dangerous to law enforcement or civilians.King also wants officer body cameras to automatically start recording upon officers unholstering their firearms.\"Why don't we have that technology?\" she asked in an interview. \"When officers are in a situation, one of the last things they're probably thinking is, 'Oh, I've got to turn my body-worn camera on.' They shouldn't be thinking about that; they should be thinking about community safety.\"She said she has been in conversation with violence prevention organizations and current and retired officers, including three past superintendents, though she declined to name them.King said not even $5 million of the $85 million set aside for violence prevention in last year's city budget has been spent; she proposes spending $200 million more on violence prevention over the next two years.\"We're in a unique situation where we've got millions of dollars of federal funds that will run out in a few years,\" she said, recalling the money the city got through the 2021-passed American Rescue Plan Act enacted to counter the financial, health-related and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We should use that money wisely, put a dent in the real problems and scale up these programs.\"King proposes enacting all changes mandated by the Chicago Police Department's consent decree, enacted because of the police murder of Laquan McDonald, by 2027. In March, the department and the Illinois attorney general extended the deadline for reforms to 2030 instead of 2027.Fundamentally, \"We need to start distributing police more equitably, but we also need more police,\" King said, hence her proposal for recruiting 1,000 retired officers into a \"Chicago Reserve\" to work at festivals and the academy and on case management and desk duty. Adding more than 200 detectives could be done, she said, by internal promotions and hiring back retired detectives.That said, CPD is facing ongoing difficulties in filling its extant open positions and issues with burnout among officers. King said many retired officers are doing security work and wondered why they would not return to the force to do similar work \"for a city that's in peril.\"Her plan also proposes adopting $10,000 in home down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers on CPD and a $5,000 hiring bonus. She also proposes compressing the officers' workweek into one where they work two 10-hour shifts over four days, which would give them multiple three days off in a row every week instead of canceled time off and six days of work on end.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Prentice ButlerReporterPrentice ButlerAfter working for the 4th Ward's last two alderpersons, Prentice Butler, a University of Chicago graduate and Bronzeville resident, has announced his candidacy for the job.In an interview, Butler said his interest in community engagement and politics began with his parents; he remembers being excited at the election of Mayor Harold Washington and how his sudden death in November of 1987 \"sucked the energy out of the room\" and put a pall over Black Chicago.\u00a0That interest in public service was enhanced by Hales Franciscan High School, 4930 S. Cottage Grove Ave., one of three all-male Catholic high schools nationwide started specifically for Black teenagers, and then the U. of C. , where he worked in the community service center under Pamela Bozeman-Evans and Michelle Obama.\"Those two women who were from my home community in Chicago, in South Shore \u2014 they were like big sisters on campus, where they were really real and candid about the things that impacted the community and how I should get involved,\" he said.\"They really taught me how to work in partnership with the community and learn how to respect every stakeholder who's involved,\" he said. \"We went to site visits not saying 'we're smarter than you, and we're going to get things done.' It was more so, 'How can we be in collaboration with you? Why don't you define the issues; let's see if we can work on this.'\"Graduating in the aftermath of the early 2000s recession, Butler worked a year for the Boy Scouts of America before becoming a legal assistant for a bankruptcy attorney. That second job ran through the spring of 2011 and thus the entirety of the Great Recession (which lasted from late-2007 through the summer of 2009).\"People were putting out predatory (mortgage) packages that really impacted low-income people in this city,\" Butler said. \"Many of the people I knew personally were impacted by bankruptcies and foreclosures.\"\u00a0His mother lost her home in 2008. \"It was a very difficult and complicated situation,\" he said. Banks gave people \"a lot of false hope\" with adjusted-rate mortgages.\u00a0\"Most of the people I saw filing bankruptcy in this district were, unfortunately, African American families that were impacted. And it gutted our communities. It cannot be overstated how bad that foreclosure crisis impacted the generational wealth of the communities on the South and West sides of the city,\" Butler said.Contemporary politics still unfolds in the shadow of the Great Recession. Butler said the recession provoked continuing destabilization in Black Chicago communities: \"Any progress we made was lost, and I think it helped to exacerbate some of the problems we're seeing today.\"He linked community violence to that destabilization, to households having to move and unstable families.\u00a0\"You're forcing people to go look for an apartment, but how can you find that apartment if your credit is bad?\" he asked. \"When we have this issue about homelessness and everything that we see increasing in the city, I think certainly there's some tie-in to what happened in '08 that's exacerbating the problems we have now in terms of housing and economics here in the city of Chicago.\"Butler earned a master's degree in Chicago studies from Loyola University Chicago in 2007, having taken night classes. Volunteering for Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation (SOUL) led to a job in constituent service, policy and communications with former Ald. William D. Burns (4th) soon after his 2011 inauguration.\u00a0Butler was not personally familiar with Ald. Sophia King (4th) before her appointment but stayed on her ward staff after Burns' resignation. He found they had similar values and was eager to expand on the work he was already doing in the ward. She made him her chief of staff; he expressed pride about their work on infrastructural projects and the series of advisory councils set up in each of the community areas in the ward.Those councils, which began with an advisory council for the Michael Reese Hospital site, \"have certainly helped us to make informed decisions that have bettered the projects that we've been concerned about and really given us the wisdom and insight to make the best decision for the community,\" Butler said.The $3.8 billion mixed-use Bronzeville Lakefront development on the site is set to have a community center, support for small businesses, an arts and culture component, and be built with a strong minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MBE/WBE) involvement because of the advisory council's input,\" he said.\"It's work I would like to continue and expand upon if I'm fortunate to be voted into this position,\" Butler said. \"I don't take anything for granted. I've been here awhile, but it doesn't mean anything. I think we're having a wealth of candidates who are going to be involved in the conversation about who should lead this great community, but I think I have great ideas that would help us lead this community forward.\"He's passionate about housing, proposing that the city's $1 lots contain houses for sale for less than $350,000. Neither he nor working class families can afford 4th Ward homes selling for up to $600,000, he said. And he worries about long-time elderly residents getting priced out of their homes.There are local Chicago Housing Authority transformation sites developers are turning into mixed-income communities like the Oakwood Shores Apartments, 3859 S. Vincennes Ave., with public, affordable and market-rate housing, but he said pressure needs to be applied to the CHA to speed up that process.\"We've been waiting for 20 years to get these on schedule, to get these redeveloped,\" Butler said. \"What we're missing is affordable, working class housing in this area.\"That housing could be built with non-traditional construction methods, like modular construction. Homes that have been for sale for a long time could be sold at a loss.\"We're moving in the right direction, but I think there has to be balance. We can't skew all to one side of things when we're talking about equitable development in our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that being the case, we have to think about innovative ways to make sure that we're supplying housing that a young family or a family that's lived here for years is able to obtain and buy.\"Butler's housing policy interest also extends to renters. \"I think everyone could be a little bit better about making sure they're being equitable in their pricing for their rental units in our community,\" he said, \"and not just mirror speculation in the market, with the market here.\"\"If people are living in homes or apartments they've been living in for years, I think we need to be understanding, on a case-by-case basis, of the needs of our elders, especially those on fixed income who are receiving Social Security and pensions. We need a little bit of nuance,\" he said. \"I'm not happy when people say, 'Well, we have to do a policy that fits everyone.' No. For the elders and those who are on a fixed income, we need to have a more understanding view of how to structure their rents.\"In terms of how policy could be more accommodating for such people, Butler noted rent control, which he acknowledged is first a conversation for the state government. (Illinois jurisdictions cannot enact rent control because the policy is banned under state law.) He said work in City Council could be done to prevent those who buy condominiums with the intent of getting a majority interest in a property from evicting long-time residents renting the condos when they try to flip the property.In terms of public safety, Butler would like to see more people working in violence interruption in addition to mental health responders. Under King, the 4th Ward has hired an unarmed security service to work in a portion of Grand Boulevard, similar to the U. of C.'s Safety Ambassador Program.\u00a0\"There's going to be more eyes on the streets and patrols in areas to make people feel safe,\" Butler said. \"They'll have connections to the (Chicago Police Department) 2nd District, so the 2nd District will have additional resources to help them in their crime fighting efforts.\"Butler said the 4th Ward should have \"the same amount of police resources and patrols\" other communities have. Like King, argues that coverage has not been the same since the closure and consolidation of mid-South Side police districts a decade ago.\"This community was promised a certain amount of resources, and we're still not getting those resources we deserve,\" he said.Butler furthermore argued that accountability and transparency are not mutually exclusive with the law enforcement equity he described. He supports the CPD consent decree with the Illinois attorney general and the planned Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability.\u00a0\"We want to make sure if there are bad actors, like there are in any profession, that they're held accountable quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we do need to have community input, which with this new advisory council that's being formed by the city, you'll have.\"With rents high on 53rd Street and in Hyde Park, Butler said the university could do more subsidization and incubation of new small businesses. He thinks that Cottage Grove Avenue, 47th Street and 43rd Street should see more commercial development. The Quad Communities Development Corporation, 4210 S. Berkeley Ave., which he praised for bringing Black-owned businesses to the 4400 Grove development, could be a continuing partner in this work.\"We have partners. In terms of funding, we're working with every resource we have in the city, whether it's TIF funding or other resources to support these small businesses,\" Butler said.\u00a0Should he be elected, Butler also said he would like to hire additional staff to work in the ward office so that the 48-hour window staff give themselves to respond to constituents could be shorter. \"If you cannot get constituent services done right, then you're not doing your job,\" he said.He further emphasized that being an alderperson is a full-time job and that it would be so for him.\"You cannot moonlight,\" said Butler, a constant presence at community meetings and sometimes-surrogate for King at events. That presence will not change if he gets the job.\u00a0King, meanwhile, who is vacating her seat to run for mayor, has endorsed Butler's candidacya.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Martina Hone, city\u2019s former chief engagement officer, stresses long experience in government in 5th Ward aldermanic run",
  "text": "Tina HoneReporterTina HoneMartina Hone, chief engagement officer for the City of Chicago since 2020, has stepped down from her role to run for 5th Ward alderwoman. An attorney who has spent decades working on Capitol Hill and in City Hall, Hone joins a crowded field of candidates to replace outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston.She was born in Hyde Park to a white father and a Black mother who met on the former 57th Street bridge between the beach and the Museum of Science and Industry. Her father once noted that she can walk into a room without people making racialized judgments about her and that her experience is different from most other Black people\u2019s.\u00a0\"I don't want to diminish and disrespect the very real challenges that people who are much more visibly African American face, including the people in my family like my sister and my mom. They face the real discrimination of being followed around the store. My nephew was stopped for 'driving while Black,'\" Hone said. \"It's a very real experience that is not part of my experience, but vicariously and very painfully, seeing what's happened to my family and to other people I love.\"She recalled how mean the landlord of their building at 54th Street and Dorchester Avenue was to her single mother after her parents' divorce before their move to Chatham and then Roseland.Hone said seeing the disparities between her father's white experience on the North Side and her mother's Black experience on the South Side, \"That whipsaw, that very visible seeing it, experiencing and feeling it is what made me such a fierce social justice warrior.\"\u00a0She eventually moved back to Hyde Park for college at the University of Chicago before moving west for law school at the University of California, Berkeley. After a few years working at law firms, she taught middle school in the Bay Area through Teach for America, which in the early 1990s was a new organization.She moved to Washington, D.C. after that, hoping to work in education policy but wound up taking jobs in the House Judiciary Committee (with a focus on immigration policy), the Commerce Department (specifically the 2000 census) and the American Legacy Foundation, an anti-tobacco use organization. In total, Hone spent more than 20 years working at the Capitol.Hone moved back to Hyde Park six years ago after her first husband died; she worked at YWCA Metropolitan Chicago for three years, ending as chief equity officer. In September 2020, she began work as Mayor Lori Lightfoot's chief engagement officer; she did not work on her 2019 mayoral campaign.In mid-September she left Lightfoot\u2019s administration to launch her aldermanic bid. As a four-year member of the Fairfax County School Board in Northern Virginia, she is the only declared candidate thus far who has experience holding an elected office.She said her experience in Congress matters as much as her experience in local government. \"All of the roles matter, because what you come to understand is it's easy to grandstand, make empty promises and say what you're going to do, but the actual task of getting things done is far more complicated and far more nuanced,\" she said.Hone was the only Black person on a school board for an affluent district in which Black and brown students made up a third of enrollment. She created an organization, Coalition of The Silence, composed of parents of color and parents of students with disabilities to advocate for their children's needs. Hone said they got third grade reading levels measured as a marker of student progress as well as kindergarten readiness considered and discriminatory discipline policies changed. She also got more people of color elected to the school board.\u00a0\"Understanding how to work in coalition and understanding how to listen to all views\" comes in handy, Hone said, in the \"incredibly complex\" 5th Ward. She noted that it contains five community areas: Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn, South Shore and Greater Grand Crossing. \"To be able to represent every part of this ward, one really has to be open enough to hearing a diversity of views,\" she said.\u00a0To do that, Hone said she would create a community council made up of representatives of all community areas and not solely comprised, she said, of \"the usual suspects.\" Not that she has anything against them (\"They become the usual suspects because they do something\"), but because there are important, smart and thoughtful people who are nevertheless apolitical and therefore are not getting their views expressed in public discourse.\"I actually would spend the time, as I did as chief engagement officer, trying to find the people who may not traditionally be at tables and give them space at the table,\" she said.\u00a0Echoing other declared candidates, Hone said public safety is a top concern of 5th Ward voters she's spoken to, adding that it\u2019s not a problem she believes can be solved with increased policing.Better policing, like shorter response times, is needed \u2014 she noted staffing shortages in the Chicago Police Department and suggested different assignments or restructuring \u2014 but she said that law enforcement will not be the thing that makes Chicago safe. She noted generational trauma's role in crime and the \"enduring results of economic disenfranchisement in the Black community.\u201d She noted the importance of entrepreneurship programs and others to help developers and contractors to counteract this, but she also wants a \"meaningful\" job program.\u00a0\"There are vacancies in the city of Chicago that could be prioritized for not the Black community, but communities that have been experiencing the most chronic levels of unemployment and the lowest levels of income,\" she said. \"Not surprisingly, those end up being predominantly Black communities.\"\"One of the hardest parts of governing is that you are generally dealing with competing legitimate interests,\" she said, recalling the town hall meetings she ran on the city's planned casino to be built in River West that has upset nearby residents. Hone said community input is an important part of the decision-making process but not dispositive.While Hone is an alumna of Lightfoot's administration, she emphasized that she is running as Tina Hone. \"Among the reasons it was incredibly important for me to step down is because I wanted to be sure that the people of the 5th Ward understood that I am not here as anyone's puppet,\" she said.She nevertheless said she has a good relationship with Lightfoot, who is running for reelection, and said of the mayor: \u201cI wish people understood her better\u2026 Like all people, she loses her temper. But in my experience, it was as constructive a work environment as I\u2019ve ever worked in.\u201d\u00a0This contrasts with the working relationship many alderpersons say they have with Lightfoot. Ald. Sophia King (4th) has been motivated to challenge Lightfoot for her job based in part by how bad she said relations are with City Council and how low in esteem alderpersons are held as partners in governing the city.Regardless of who wins the mayoral election, Hone noted the huge number of vacancies coming to City Council, calling the incoming number of freshmen alderpersons \"a fresh start.\"\"I think it's a great opportunity to have a restart button where City Council members can have a more active role in not just representing their wards but being partners in the governing of the city,\" Hone said.\u00a0In terms of local development, Hone said she is a supporter of the Obama Presidential Center, but hopes the engagement process going forward \"is broader than just the communities just directly around the Obama Center,\" noting the effect the closure of Cornell Drive will have on Far South Side communities like Roseland.\u00a0Hone believes the OPC will lead to the revitalization and redevelopment of South Shore, and she wants to ensure that any benefits that come are equitably shared. \"It's important that we put development dollars into neighborhoods that have been completely disinvested in,\" she said. \"71st Street should be as vibrant as 53rd Street.\"Many South Shore residents and community organizations, such as Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) \u2013 a member of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition \u2013 however, have repeatedly raised concerns that the \u201credevelopment\u201d of the neighborhood could lead to widespread displacement as housing costs rise. Calls for the development of more affordable housing in the neighborhood \u2013 such as what was guaranteed in the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance \u2013 and stronger protections for renters have largely been ignored by the City.When asked about maintaining affordability in Hyde Park, Hone said homeowners should be able to take advantage of increasing property values without the risk of losing their homes. She said that large rental companies like Mac Properties and Pangea Properties operate like monopolies, decrying the declining number of mom-and-pop resident landlords and calling it \"a much more important piece of the affordable housing puzzle\u201d than most people recognize.\"When you're in the neighborhood and it's your building, you're going to take care of that building in a different way than being an absentee investor who just bought up a lot of six-flats,\" she said. \"We need to figure out how to make mega-developers accountable for the things that they're doing and are able to do in terms of increasing rents subtly.\"Incentivizing landlords to buy and operate locally and at a small scale through financing is something the council should investigate, she said.Hone said her experience in government would give her a leg up in handling constituent services, particularly in the Byzantine city bureaucracy. Not only does she know who to call, but she said she has existing relationships with people in local departments and agencies. She said she would like to open a service office in a central location in the ward.And she said she would be a steady advocate for Promontory Point, which holds personal significance to her as a native Hyde Parker. \"I really, really believe there is a way to preserve the point with the limestone and beauty that it is. And it'll be a priority to me,\" she said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Blackstone Ave.Construction on the \"Kenwood Link,\" Kenwood Academy's $8.3 million elevated, enclosed pedway connecting the main building with the former Canter Middle School is set to begin in early 2023.On Sept. 13, the Public Buildings Commission voted to approve the project's final budget \u2014 up from last year's estimates of $7.5 million \u2014 and proceed with construction.According to a representative of the commission, is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\u00a0The process to get the pedway build has stretched for years. As it stands, students have to leave one building to go to the other, braving the elements. The pedway will span the parking lot between the two buildings, linking them.\"It's been a longstanding desire of the principal of that campus to make sure that those buildings are linked so that there can be free flow between administrator staff and students,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot during the commission meeting.In previous Herald reporting, Calloway has said the pedway is dual-purpose: Shielding students and staff from the elements and improving campus safety.Though Ald. Sophia King (4th) initially proposed paying for the project through dollars raised by the 53rd Street Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, district, funding will instead come from the Chicago Public Schools' 2022 Capital Budget.Funding for CPS' 2022 Capital budget, which totals $706.6 million of investments to neighborhood schools across the city, comes primarily from future issuance of general obligation bonds, which are principally repaid by the district's Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) model.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.I remain flummoxed at the cost of this steel and glass breezeway between buildings.

  "text": "Ebony LucasReporterEbony LucasEbony Lucas, an Oakland real estate attorney, is the first declared candidate for next year\u2019s open-seat election for alderperson of the 4th Ward, focusing on affordable housing and local commercial development.\"I still live in the community. I still love this community. I'm still passionate about the development that can occur in this community when it comes to bringing jobs and more commercial development here, when it comes to affordable housing,\" she said in an interview. \"Those are the things that have always been important to me and will continue to be important to me that I've continued to work on since the last time I ran.\"In her practice, Lucas said she has worked to educate people through her work to foster understanding about housing options. She said it is not uncommon for her to have clients go from paying $1,600 a month in rent to $900 in monthly mortgage payments.\"Programs that create opportunities for people to be able to purchase homes\" could create affordable housing, she said. She would like to see this backed by down-payment assistance programs, and she said people could be judged worthy of mortgages by whether they pay their rents on time instead of their credit scores alone.Lucas furthermore suggested landlords receive tax benefits to incentivize low rents.\"The aldermen legislate for the City of Chicago. There are state and federal funds available to the city that we can create these opportunities that will help us maintain and create opportunities for affordable housing,\" she said.\"We have a lot of vacant lots in the 4th Ward. We have a lot of commercial properties that are vacant. When we bring businesses in these properties, then these owners in these properties are no longer able to have their property taxes abated because their properties are vacant. Now if we're building on these vacant lots, we have more taxpayers. More taxpayers brings in more tax dollars.\"In terms of public safety, Lucas suggested investments in commercial development, like the public-private Invest South/West initiative, to create jobs as well as mental health care and trauma support for students and families.Asked how her professional experience has prepared her for establishing a working relationship with the city services constituents need and advocating for them, Lucas pointed to her 18 years as managing partner of her own law firm, the Property Law Group, as well as her investments in real estate.\"I pride myself on providing quality housing to people, and I live in the community,\" she said. \"It's important to me to see all of those things taken care of, making sure that our trash is picked up, making sure that our trees are cut.\"She said trees on city-owned land in her neighborhood are overgrown, limiting visibility and thereby imperiling public safety, and that it takes years for the city to send workers out to trim them.\"Those types of things are unacceptable,\" she said.It's Lucas' third run for the seat \u2014 she ran in the 2017 special election and in 2019 \u2014 but there's a difference this time: the incumbent, Ald. Sophia King, is not seeking reelection.\"Things have changed,\" Lucas said. \"The previous incumbent had a lot of support, and everyone wanted to give her a chance. And she accomplished what she needed to accomplish as the 4th Ward alderman, and she's moving on now to run for mayor. So the opportunity is there for someone else who's just as passionate about the community to come in and continue the programs that are already going on and to expand on them.\"I definitely think that my experience as a businessperson, my experience as someone in real estate, my experiences really being a member of the community and being active in the community, whether it's been Bud Billiken or Mandrake Park (3858 S. Cottage Grove Ave.; she served as president of its park advisory council) or 4th on 53rd \u2014 really being active in a lot of community programs and with a lot of community organizations, I have a lot to share with the ward.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.ReporterAld. Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) will not seek reelection to a seventh term on City Council next year.\"I am retiring at the end of my term. I will have completed six terms, 24 years. That's a quarter of a century. It's time for the next chapter,\" Hairston said in an interview on Friday.Hairston, 61, said she is \"definitely not retiring for good,\" however, saying, \"I've got a lot of work in me. I've still got a lot of things that I want to do.\" She is a lawyer by profession, having previously worked in Springfield in the state attorney general's office, and said she will serve out her term as Democratic committeewoman of the 5th Ward into 2024.While she has no plans to run for another public office, she is confident that she would have won reelection had she sought it. She is currently unsure about whether she will endorse a successor, noting she is talking to potential candidates but wants to let constituents decide.\"I am not leaving the community: I am still going to be active and engaged, just in a different way,\" she said.Hairston is now the 12th alderperson who began a four-year term in 2019 but will not be serving after Election Day next April. The fact that nearly a quarter of City Council has resigned, been indicted or announced retirements or bids for public office is being taken as a reflection of acrimonious working conditions in City Hall and a greater difficulty in providing constituent services in a world ruptured by COVID-19.At a July 2021 constituents' meeting, Hairston said the council was a place she did not recognize anymore.In the interview, Hairston said she had taken several factors into consideration before announcing her retirement, with the length of her public service being foremost among them.\u00a0Hairston was born in Chicago to Reva and Lester Hairston, a Chicago Public Schools educator and a tavern owner who was the first African American in the city to buy a McDonalds franchise, respectively. She grew up in Hyde Park and South Shore, attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Loyola University Chicago School of Law.As an attorney in private practice, Hairston beat one-term incumbent Ald. Barbara Holt (5th) in 1999 in a runoff, slamming her for the state of constituent services and her ward office\u2019s unresponsiveness; Hairston\u2019s campaign ran with the slogan \"I'll Be There,\" the Tribune reported. The late former Ald. Leon Despres (5th) endorsed Hairston, who has in turn called him a mentor.Hairston had a working relationship with former Mayor Richard M. Daley, praising his administration's investments in the 5th Ward and rapport with alderpersons. She was one of five alderpersons to vote against his catastrophic deal to lease the city's parking meters and corresponding revenue for decades in exchange for an up-front payment. She said she considered running for mayor in 2010 but decided she was not ready to stop being an alderwoman.\u00a0She had frostier relations with former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, criticizing his education policy in particular. She endorsed his runoff challenger, now-U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-4th), against his reelection campaign; after news broke about the police murder of Laquan McDonald, she proposed a more stringent police oversight agency than Emanuel's Civilian Office of Police Accountability.Hairston endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, with whom she served for a decade-plus in City Council, in the 2019 mayoral election.\u00a0Hairston's own election that year would turn out to be the closest of her aldermanic career, as she was forced into a runoff by South Shore community activist William Calloway. He argued, alongside third-place finisher and former Herald editor Gabriel Piemonte, that Hairston had become inattentive to constituent needs after 20 years in office and noted that her council committee attendance was poor. Hairston won by a razor-thin margin, 50.7% of the vote to Calloway\u2019s 49.3%.Hairston has spent the past few years working to get a supermarket established in South Shore; Local Market Foods, 2101 E. 71st St., opened in 2019, after a Trader Joe's in Hyde Park, 1528 E. 55th St., opened earlier that year. In a press release announcing her retirement Friday, Hairston also touted the Obama Presidential Center, the Stony Island Arts Bank, 6760 S. Stony Island Ave., and the South Shore Starbucks, 7101 S. Stony Island Ave.An old associate of the Obamas, Hairston has been a staunch and enthusiastic supporter of the OPC that is now under construction in Jackson Park. After initial resistance, she came out in favor of an anti-displacement community benefits agreement for nearby neighborhoods during her last reelection campaign; after Mayor Lori Lightfoot took office, she worked with her administration and freshman Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) to pass the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance.\u00a0A South Shore Condo Co-Op Preservation Fund Pilot to issue grants to vulnerable owner-occupants in that neighborhood passed the council this July.The now-vice chair of the Finance Committee, Hairston prides herself on thoroughly examining every ordinance before she votes on it. She said her legislative focus on police accountability and reform has stalled against the Lightfoot administration, however. Her ordinances to codify a right to a phone call for those in Chicago Police Department custody within a specific amount of time and another to put regulations on police raids in the aftermath of the botched raid on Anjanette Young have never come up for a vote.\u00a0Hairston did, however, co-sponsor the ordinance that will create Chicago's new police accountability body, the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, which will replace COPA. She worked on it with the Lightfoot administration, other alderpersons, jurists and advocates from the Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC) and Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) coalitions.\"I\u2019m glad to say that we owe Ald. Hairston a debt of gratitude for her service,\" said Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School with whom she has collaborated on police accountability policy, over email. \"There are many politicians who claim to have made a difference, she truly has done so in Chicago, consistently speaking out to serve everyday people and protect the rights of people who have been most marginalized. I am deeply grateful for her service.\"Hairston said she \"will continue the work\" she started in her final nine months of office: \"I cannot be more specific because things pop up all the time. I want to continue to work on the South Shore condominium pilot program; I would like to see that expanded into the other communities. I'm going to continue doing my job and loving every minute of it, like I do now.\"\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"The students I have supported, the (South Shore) Triathlon kids. There is so much.\"When Hairston and King, who is running for mayor, depart City Council, Hyde Park will have an entirely new aldermanic delegation, similar to how the area had an entirely new state legislative delegation in 2019. A few precincts of northwestern Hyde Park have been drawn into the 20th Ward, where the incumbent, Ald. Jeanette Taylor, has said she will run for reelection.Just one candidate, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode, has said he is running for alderman of the 5th Ward, and no one has declared candidacy in the 4th Ward.As her long goodbye begins, Hairston said she did not enter public life for any kind of status.\"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community,\" she said. \"That is what was most important to me and what will continue to be most important to me.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comCook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle served on City Council with Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) from 1999 to 2010.\"I knew Leslie when she first ran in 1999. She's been a friend and a colleague for a very long time. For a decade, she was a friend and colleague. She's still a friend, and she, of course, is part of our 'Hyde Park Mafia' that has done so well in local politics,\" Preckwinkle said.\"I think there's been a tradition of independent, Democratic progressive \u2014 however you want to call it \u2014 leadership in the community and in the 4th and 5th wards. I think that's something of which we can all be proud, and I'm sure Leslie is proud of the two and a half decades she's served as alderman of the 5th Ward.Ald. Sophia King (4th) has served with Hairston since 2016 and issued a statement in her capacity as chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, of which Hairston was a founding member.\"Saddened but not surprised. The City Council is losing one of its most fervent and vocal leaders in the progressive space. Ald. Hairston has championed and was an early supporter for many of the progressive causes for which we are just now seeing the fruits of her labor like civilian oversight of the police. She will be missed but we will continue to carry the torch which she has valiantly held for so many years. I wish her the best in her next chapter,\" said King.Mayor Lori Lightfoot issued a statement: \"I thank Ald. Leslie Hairston for her decades of committed service to the 5th Ward and our city. Throughout her years of leadership, she was forward-thinking and always put her residents first as she tirelessly advocated for criminal justice reform, neighborhood development and so much more. I wish her all the best in this next chapter of her career and am confident we\u2019ll continue to see great things from her.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Desmon Yancy, South Shore police accountability activist, running for 5th Ward alderman",
  "text": "Desmon YancyReporterDesmon YancyOne of the public faces of the successful campaign to create an elected board for civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department, Desmon Yancy is running to be the next alderman of the 5th Ward.Yancy, who co-founded and is the spokesperson of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the subsequent Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) coalitions, has long been involved in work around police accountability and public safety.\"We've still got a long way to go in a city that's had issues around policing on paper since the 1960s and, with this current consent decree and the failures of the city to meet these deadlines, it's clear that it's a big boat to turn around,\u201d said Yancy. \u201cBut I'm happy to do my part.\"Born in the 8th Ward and a 1989 graduate from Kenwood Academy, Yancy is the son of a Chicago policeman who worked on Harold Washington\u2019s mayoral campaign and a mother who did medical billing and was an active volunteer with their church. After spending a year at DeVry University, he worked in sales and served in AmeriCorps VISTA, as a teacher's assistant at Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St., in the mid-1990s. He said the experience showed him the difficulties schools face when they are not adequately funded.In 2007, he got into union organizing with SEIU Healthcare and eventually created a program there that taught labor leadership and organizing.\"The gist of it was really to make sure that union workers could go home to their communities and provide the same leadership,\" Yancy said. \"When you're thinking about the housing crisis, when banks abandoned homes in formerly great neighborhoods, or fighting to raise the minimum wage across the city, these leaders played often-key roles in organizing their own community outside of the union work.\"He worked with SEIU until 2013, leading canvassing teams with the union in support of both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in Chicago, Northwest Indiana and Wisconsin. In 2014, he worked on a local voter registration project with 13 coalition partners, which he described as both challenging and \"a first taste of how important it is for organizations to work across the city in order to have change.\"Following the police murder and coverup of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in fall 2014, a coalition of community organizations came together to form Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability in 2016. Yancy was a co-founding member of the coalition, and would become its policy coordinator.Over the years GAPA, in partnership with groups like the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), other public safety coalitions and community organizations, would push for the City Council to create a platform for civilian oversight of the police. In July 2021, City Council created the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and 22 district councils, elected for each of the city\u2019s police districts.\"A lot of it was 'slow and steady winning the race' and being true to your convictions, especially when we ran up against opposition from Mayor Lightfoot,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cShe was fully in support of our proposal for police oversight in Chicago and then at a point got cold feet, because she thought that district councils would have too much power\u2026 But we stayed true to what we felt was really a key principle of the work that we were doing, which was transparency and accountability.\u201dShould he be elected alderman, Yancy would like to push the city towards creating more policy accountability and oversight, which he said is still lacking even after the commission and councils' creation. He named outgoing Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th), Roderick Sawyer (6th) and Harry Osterman (48th) as well as Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and North Side Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) as particularly hard workers behind the July 2021 measure. But Yancy said more needs to be done to support it behind the scenes.\"Like I said, I'm the son of a police officer, but at the same time I've been working on police accountability for the last six years,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cI certainly understand the work that needs to be done and look forward to being able to support that work on council.\"Lightfoot appointed seven interim commissioners in August; Yancy said he has been working with them to develop talking points about issues like the police budget. He said the interim CCPSA is looking to make an immediate impact. It will eventually play a role in hiring and removing a police superintendent, Police Board members and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) chief administrator, as well as approving departmental general orders, enacting its own policies and supervising the department, COPA and the Police Board.Asked how he would work with law enforcement in the 5th Ward, Yancy noted that he worked with the CPD in passing the oversight ordinance. \"Those conversations aren't easy, but they're important,\" he said. \"It's a slow process to get the police department bought into police reform efforts.\"He said police are largely responding to rhetoric like \"defund the police\" but he can work with them, with his personal background and his perspective that law enforcement is a partner in public safety that should not be othered.Neighborhood safety \u2014 residents' safety and police officers' safety \u2014 should be paramount as individuals in either group do not currently feel safe, Yancy said.\"It is helpful when police officers hear issues from people who have families deeply impacted by police misconduct,\" he said. \"One officer I was talking to who was in leadership at the time told me about how he, as a teenager, was assaulted by a police officer, which motivated him to become a police officer.\u201cThere's more to it, and as long as we look at it from our polls and don't look at it in terms of what the actual goal is, which is public safety, then we're going to have a much more difficult time.\"He wants to have the authority of an aldermanic office to motivate those conversations with more people, to do away with fear and build community support \"for the right efforts.\"Yancy is currently directing organizing and advocacy for the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, overseeing and facilitating the organization's policy and advocacy agenda. He continues to live in South Shore and is the father of an 8 year old.Promontory Point is one of their favorite places to walk, and Yancy is concerned about South Shore lakefront property owners affected by the lake's erosion and flooding. He called Hairston's July-passed South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance, \"a great start.\" He said more programs like it are needed, especially ones that are easily accessible to everyday people.Asked about constituent services, Yancy talked about modernizing the 5th Ward office. He would seek to hire young staffers to engage youth around things like political education, aiming to decrease distrust in government, as well as longtime 5th Ward residents, to add credibility to the office. He also talked of creating an \"office-on-wheels\" to bring constituent services to all four neighborhoods the ward covers.\"There's some level-setting that needs to be done with constituents,\" he said, setting the goal to under-promise and over-deliver. \"I think there are many constituents who think that alderpeople have particular power in their wards that they don't.\"Hyde Park's commercial corridors look different than South Shore's, which are beset by empty lots. \"As we look at that and look at the lack of employment, there's a direct correlation,\" he said. \"I would love to see grants or funding to small businesses, to capitalize them.\"As construction continues on the Obama Presidential Center, Yancy said he would like to see a mix of national and local businesses flourish along Stony Island Avenue, similar to 53rd Street's commercial mixture.\"I would just love for South Shore, Woodlawn and Greater Grand Crossing to feel like the same sort of community,\" he said. \"I know it's not anything that's going to be achieved in one, two or even three terms. However, I think setting the groundwork legislatively to ensure that those funds are there to capitalize businesses, offer some business support and use the weight of the office to encourage economic development will be important.\"Yancy wants to ensure the ward is attractive to new families and college graduates as well as longtime residents. He called for a balance between affordable housing and transit-oriented developments to curb runaway inflation in housing costs. He would like to see something like Hairston and Taylor's Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance for South Shore.Mental health is another issue of importance to Yancy. He said more resources should go into homelessness prevention, particularly in Woodlawn and South Shore. That call for equity would also include funneling resources to the ward's schools, so that, as he put it, Revere Elementary School, 1010 E. 72nd St., and Murray Language Academy, 5335 S. Kenwood Ave., could perform at the same level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Ald. Sophia King running for mayor, talks city council tenure and public safety",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Mayor Lori Lightfoot did not get enough votes to make it to the runoff, something that hasn\u2019t happened to an incumbent Chicago mayor in forty years. Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson will face off in April, along with a handful of alderpersons who didn\u2019t secure fifty percent of the vote in their wards.

She is the first incumbent mayor to lose in Chicago since 1983. Four years ago, Hyde Park was the only community area she lost to her runoff opponent, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.The two local candidates, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Sophia King (4th), fell short, both garnering less than 2% of the vote.\u201cWe lead the pack on offering real concrete solutions, and it\u2019s my fervent hope that the next mayor of Chicago will put politics aside and collaborate with our communities, City Council and Springfield and Washington to make Chicago work better than it ever has,\u201d said Buckner in a statement. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expecting different results: we need both new approaches to policing and dedicated violence prevention funding and coordination across the city.\u201dKing, conceding at the Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove Ave., thanked her supporters and her support in Chicago, adding that she is looking forward to spending time with her family.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.I am a 3rd generation Hyde Park/Kenwood Chicagoan. This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner (D-26th) is running for mayor to unseat Mayor Lori Lightfoot from City Hall in 2023.\u00a0\"I'm a son of Chicago. I was born and raised in the city. The city is extremely important to me. It's given me everything that I have, and I understand the difficulties that I face,\" he said in an interview. \"But I'm also raising my son in Chicago, and I understand the opportunities that we have to make Chicago the city that she deserves to be.\"We have spent so much time recently fighting with each other, and we've not spent enough time fighting for our city, and I think we need visionary, transformative leadership to actually do that work.\"The Bronzeville-based state representative said some core issues his campaign will focus on are improving Chicago Public Schools and reducing crime. His legislative district spans the city\u2019s lakefront, including parts of Gold Coast, South Loop, Bronzeville, Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn and South Shore.The chairman of the Illinois Black Caucus kicked off his campaign this afternoon at the corner of 18th Street and Wabash Avenue before a crowd of dozens of supporters.\u201cWe cannot wait a day longer for a safe and just Chicago for all of us,\u201d he said, calling for more investment in schools and ways to give the city\u2019s children a path to success. \u201cWe need a mayor who can bring people together to get things done for Chicago.\u201dBuckner was appointed to the Illinois House of Representatives in 2019 to replace Christian Mitchell, who resigned to become deputy governor. Buckner was reelected in 2020 without opposition, and has supported legislation on firearm restrictions, renewable energy development and criminal justice reform.\u00a0\u00a0He is the grandson of a Baptist minister and the son of a sheriff's deputy sergeant and a public school teacher from Mississippi who was the first in her family to go to college. He grew up in Roseland; his first memory, as a three-year-old, was attending Mayor Harold Washington's wake in the Loop.If elected, Buckner would be the first mayor since Washington to be a Chicago Public Schools graduate. \"My matriculation through that district is going to be important to me as we make decisions on bringing the city forward on an educational standpoint,\" he said.After graduating from Morgan Park High School, Buckner studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he played defensive tackle for the Fighting Illini football team. He later got a degree from the DePaul University College of Law.Prior to his election to the Illinois House of Representatives, Buckner's professional background was split between sports business and nonprofits. He worked on the Wrigley Field renovations and served as executive director for the youth organization World Sport Chicago (born out of the city\u2019s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics). He was also a member of Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Capitol Hill staff and worked for former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu.Buckner said he has the executive experience to run a city of millions of people and a City Council with 50 alderpersons. \"It is also evident to me that it requires us to bring folks together and to be able to have conversations,\" he said. \"If you look at the work I've done in Springfield, it has really been highlighted by bringing people together.\"In Springfield, Buckner championed legislation allowing Illinois college athletes to be paid for the use of their names and likenesses and another bill this year that would ban \"ghost guns,\" firearms made from kits or 3D-printed without serial numbers. He was also a lead negotiator on Gov. J.B. Pritzker's landmark 2021 energy plan, which will force fossil fuel power plants offline by 2045, and put billions of dollars toward renewable and nuclear energy.A crowd claps for state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) as he arrives at 18th Street and Wabash Avenue to announce his run for mayor of Chicago, May 12Just before his campaign launch, Buckner said his proudest accomplishment has been the passage of legislation around the Black Caucus' pillars: criminal justice, economic access, education and health care.As chair of the caucus' House bloc, Buckner has been a vocal defender of the Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act, which will end cash bail for the vast majority of crimes in Illinois next year and change use-of-force guidelines for law enforcement, create a new police certification system and expand detainee rights.The third candidate to announce a mayoral bid, Buckner is up against two other South Siders: millionaire businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, who also ran in 2019, and Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th).As campaign season heats up, Buckner\u2019s opponents may bring up past personal mistakes; he has pleaded guilty twice to driving under the influence. The first occurred in 2010 in Urbana, after he graduated from college, and the second as a freshman legislator in 2019, when Springfield police officers found him asleep at the wheel a few blocks from the statehouse, the Tribune reported. He has since paid the fines and completed the community service required for the misdemeanors.Throughout his career Buckner has been outspoken on issues of policing and public safety. Early in May 2020, he reported on a police officer stopping him and demanding to see proof of purchase and identification after he left a South Loop retailer, saying that the officer said he \"looked like he was up to something.\"\u201cWhich begs the question, what does someone who is up to something look like?\u201d Buckner asked on Twitter. He recalled the talks young Black boys receive \"on how to maneuver a society that often looks at you as a threat first\" and a mentor who told him as a teenager to \"dress like a prospect and not a suspect.\"At today\u2019s campaign launch, Buckner continued: \u201cWhere you live should not determine if you live,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing a Black kid from the South Side, I know what it\u2019s like to lie down on the wet pavement handcuffed because police officers think I fit a description.\"I'm a lifelong South Sider who has decided to remain a South Sider, and it's important to me that I bring all those experiences to bear in City Hall,\" he said. \"I bring all of that with me in this race and, hopefully, a Buckner administration.\"If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on February 28, the two frontrunners will have a runoff on April 4.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Harper Ave.\u00a0Eligible 5th Ward residents overwhelmingly voted to pass two advisory referendums urging newly-elected officials to support a South Shore Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) and build more affordable housing in Woodlawn.\u00a0The two referendums appeared on ballots in several 5th Ward precincts located in Woodlawn and South Shore during the citywide municipal election on Feb. 28. Organizers behind the non-binding ballot measures say they are intended to show the incoming mayor and alderman how important issues of affordable housing and displacement are to 5th Ward voters and propose solutions.In South Shore, a referendum asking a new mayor and alderperson to support a South Shore CBA ordinance appeared on the ballot in nine of the neighborhood\u2019s precincts that border Jackson Park: precincts two through five and seven through 11.The referendum asked if elected officials should support the ordinance \u201cto prevent the displacement of renters, condo and homeowners in South Shore in light of the impact of the Obama Center and growing development in the area.\u201d It suggests that such an ordinance establish a fund for home repairs, provide property tax and rent relief, eviction protection, job programs and the development of 100% affordable housing on city-owned vacant lots.\u00a0Across precincts, 88.79% of voters (2,155 out of 2,427) voted \u201cyes\u201d on the referendum, according to the Chicago Board of Elections.\u00a0\u201cIt's overwhelmingly clear at this point that folks believe in what we're talking about, which is that folks should be able to stay in their neighborhood and benefit from the (Obama Presidential) Center,\u201d said Dixon Romeo, a leader of the CBA Coalition, the group of community organizations pushing for the ordinance. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a holistic package. A South Shore CBA doesn\u2019t prevent any business from happening, but does put things in place so that homeowners, condo owners and renters aren\u2019t displaced by the Obama Center.\u201d\u00a0In September 2020, after years of community conversations and campaigning by organizations in the CBA Coalition, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the Chicago City Council passed the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance required the city to set aside 52 vacant lots in Woodlawn for affordable housing and dedicate $4.5 million toward expanding housing programs in the neighborhood.\u00a0Since its passage, South Shore residents have called for similar protections against displacement in their neighborhood, which were ultimately cut out of the original Woodlawn ordinance.\u00a0In November 2021, the CBA Coalition announced its demands for a South Shore CBA; organizers say they\u2019ve gotten little response from the mayor or elected officials since.A referendum question asking whether the new mayor and alderman should support building affordable housing on the vacant lot at 63rd Street and Blackstone Avenue appeared on a few hundred ballots in Woodlawn.On ballots in the 13th and 14th precincts, the referendum asked if elected officials should support that the city-owned lot be \u201cat least 75% truly affordable housing \u2026 to ensure that residents can afford to stay in the neighborhood as housing costs soar.\u201dIn essence, the referendum urges city officials to develop this lot as part of the Woodlawn ordinance. Affordability, in this case, would require that renters pay no more than 30% of their monthly income towards rent.Signs the CBA has lined up along all city-owned lots they say should be set aside for affordable housing, 2022.Across the two precincts, 91.57% of voters (456 out of 498) voted in favor, according to the Board of Elections.On Election Day, Savannah Brown, a housing organizer with South Side Together Organizing for Power (STOP), a CBA Coalition member, chatted up voters outside of the 14th precinct polling place. She and other STOP organizers were out sharing information about the referendum.\u00a0She said the process to get the lots developed has been too slow. \u201cSince we got the (Woodlawn) ordinance passed, we\u2019ve been asking for these lots,\u201d Brown said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been holding onto that one (on 63rd) for some reason.\u201dBrown noted that the ordinance only guarantees these lots affordable for 30 years.\u00a0Activists with the CBA Coalition want to pre-select the city-owned lots to ensure that the developments are located in high-density areas, which would allow for the construction of large buildings (and more units). The 63rd and Blackstone site fits these parameters, and Brown said it will be the closest to the OPC out of the sites selected so far.\u00a0\u00a0Though the referendums are non-binding, \u201cit\u2019s literally going to be a number that says \u2018hey, this is what the people want,\u201d Brown said. She hopes that elected officials will \u201csee the value of using the (recommendations of) people that have lived here and actually giving them the opportunities that have been promised.\u201d\u00a0She is also hopeful that the referendum for a South Shore CBA will push local electeds to an ordinance, noting that the Woodlawn ordinance came after a similar referendum question for a CBA in the 2019 municipal election.Herald editor Hannah Faris contributed reporting.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

Lamont Robinson (D-5th) has emerged as the frontrunner to succeed Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, having won every precinct in the ward in the Feb. 28 municipal election.His failure to clear 50%, however, means he will likely face the apparent second-place finisher Prentice Butler, King\u2019s chief of staff, in an April 4 runoff.Robinson won around 46% of the vote in six of the ward\u2019s precincts in Hyde Park and Kenwood south of 47th Street, just below his ward-wide margin. He appears to have won a majority of the vote in nine of the ward\u2019s 28 precincts.Butler, meanwhile, won almost 18% of the local vote, exceeding his 15% margin across the ward. Third-place finisher Ebony Lucas, a real estate attorney, trailed him ward-wide by less than a percentage point but only won a little less than 13% of the local vote.Separated by a margin of 60 votes, a second place finisher won\u2019t be officially announced until the remaining mail-in ballots are tallied up.Butler and Lucas both polled some of their highest margins in Kenwood. Lucas came in second place in several of the ward\u2019s precincts, but Butler beat her in five of the six in Hyde Park-Kenwood.The probable defeat marks Lucas\u2019 third in the 4th Ward. She lost to King in a 2017 special election after the alderwoman\u2019s appointment to City Council and again in 2019, when she was King\u2019s sole challenger. Lucas won a smaller percentage of the vote this year than she did in her previous two elections.5th Ward aldermanic runoff candidates Desmon Yancy and Martina \"Tina\" Hone.Tina Hone, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s former chief engagement officer and a Hyde Park resident, owes her ticket to the 5th Ward\u2019s runoff election to voters in the neighborhood.\u00a0The overall top vote-getter, South Shore community organizer Desmon Yancy, won a lower percentage of the vote in Hyde Park than he did across the ward, 26.1% versus 23.6%. He nevertheless bettered Hone\u2019s 22.7% margin in Hyde Park; Hone got 17.8% of the overall vote.Yancy, outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston\u2019s endorsee, nearly swept the ward\u2019s South Shore precincts, losing one in the Jackson Park Highlands to businessman Kris Levy by a single vote. (Levy came in seventh place overall, after Woodlawn activist Joshua Gray.)Three other Hyde Parkers, attorney Renita Ward, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode and Jocelyn Hare, who works at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris Policy Labs, came in third, fourth and fifth place in the neighborhood, winning 13.8%, 13.3% and 10.7%, respectively. Their ward-wide margins were 12.4%, 10.6% and 7.7%.Dee Perkins of South Shore, Marlene Fisher of Greater Grand Crossing, Gabriel Piemonte of Woodlawn and Robert Palmer of Greater Grand Crossing, finished out the pack. Piemonte, a former Herald editor, saw his support drop more than 20 points since the first round of the ward's 2019 aldermanic campaign in which he also ran.

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

With over half of ballots cast in the ward race for her, Taylor avoided an April runoff election.Retired police officer Jennifer Maddox, who ran for the seat in 2019 and to be the ward\u2019s Democratic committeewoman in 2020, captured about 26.4% of the vote; Andre Smith, a minister and entrepreneur, captured 20.7%.Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) talks to a supporter at her election night party at Studio Imani, 5917 S. State St., Feb. 28.Prior to City Council, Taylor\u00a0was a community organizer\u00a0who fought for a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) for the incoming Obama Presidential Center in nearby Jackson Park and participated in the successful 34-day hunger\u00a0strike to keep Washington Park\u2019s Walter H. Dyett High School from closing.She was elected 20th Ward alderwoman in the 2019 runoffs after Willie Cochran, a three-term alderman, was\u00a0indicted by a federal grand jury\u00a0on corruption charges.\u00a0One of City Council's great firebrands, Taylor\u2019s first-term achievements include passing the\u00a02020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance,a\u00a0landmark piece of legislation\u00a0that contains a suite of housing programs designed to protect both homeowners and residents from displacement due to increases in housing prices and land value.She also\u00a0strove to \"turn power back to the community,\" specifically gaining constituent input in decisions around development and other ward business.\"I've been a woman of my word. I've stood up for my community; I've stood with my community,\" Taylor said in a September interview announcing her reelection bid. \"I still have a lot of work to do. You can't change culture and community in four years, but I feel like the community is moving in the right direction.\"A key issue in the last few months of the campaign has been the city's use of a vacant Woodlawn school as a shelter for migrants coming to Chicago.in early February, after several delays and amid opposition from community members, the city moved more than 100 men and women into the former Wadsworth Elementary School, 6420 S. University Ave.Taylor blasted the sudden move-in, saying Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration has pitted the Black and Latino communities against each other again \"through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands.\"Going forward,\u00a0Taylor said she wants Woodlawn to get resources in light of the systemic racism it has experienced from the city in the past and for Chicago \"to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Harper Ave., for expansion, including an outdoor patio space \u2014 and is part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's $1.2 billion post-COVID Chicago Recovery Plan.The building opened in 1924. The Washington Park National Bank closed seven years later, but the building remained an attractive location for offices for decades afterwards. The late Rev.

DL3 Realty, 90 E. 103rd St., made plans to buy and demolish it the next year. In 2022, however, the plans changed to preserve the building's five-story limestone facade alongside a new 75,000-square-foot construction behind it, the Sun-Times reported.DL3 Realty did not respond to a request for comment by press time.DL3 Realty has or is in the process of developing several other properties in Woodlawn, including the 2019-opened Jewel Osco at 6014 S.

In more recent history, Woodlawn has welcomed Black residents, like myself, being displaced by the gentrification from other neighborhoods in our own city. In the spirit of this legacy, I am urging us to welcome asylum seekers and unhoused local residents to the vacant Wadsworth building. I hope that we can learn from each other, and continue our rich history of community collaboration.Too often, the City of Chicago has pitted Black and brown communities against each other. Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s administration has done just that through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands. I want my community to be respected and supported with resources after decades of racist disinvestment, AND I want our city to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life . We can do both. My office will be hosting a community meeting on February 16th to discuss WITH the community how we can welcome our new neighbors to Woodlawn and demand resources for longtime community residents.\u201dAs a response to what I heard in the previous community meetings, I offered the Mayor and her team the list of demands below to ensure Sanctuary for All in Woodlawn and the 20th Ward as a whole. So far, the Department of Family & Support Services has only agreed to open the shelter to both asylum-seekers and unhoused city residents along with vague commitments to provide immigration services to current 20th Ward immigrants through an existing program and engage Woodlawn neighbors in a community process to determine the use of other vacant Chicago Public School properties in the ward. The vacant Wadsworth building will go through a community process when the shelter closes. I am calling on Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s administration to agree to the following:Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.As a homeowner adjacent to the site, and probably the homeowner closest to the site, I couldn't agree more with Alderman Taylor. The former Wadsworth school is only available BECAUSE the city has not honored ANY of the promises and assurances made to the community since the school was vacated. The work began with a \"Daley-esque Meigs Field\" attempt to get the conversion well underway before notifying anyone, BECAUSE they knew it was wrong and intentionally so. Because I personally use the fields and greenspace and have personally removed glass, bottles, and even dead animal carcasses WHEN THE CITY NEGLECTED IT FOR YEARS ON END, I claim the right to have a say.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "(Left to right) Andre Smith Luis Cardona\u00a0block a bus transporting migrants to the temporary shelter at the former Wadsworth elementary school building,\u00a06420 S. University Ave., on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.(Left to right) Andre Smith Luis Cardona\u00a0block a bus transporting migrants to the temporary shelter at the former Wadsworth elementary school building,\u00a06420 S. University Ave., on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.The city has begun moving hundreds of migrants into the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn Thursday morning amidst continued resistance from some residents.Early in the morning on Feb. 2, a city bus arrived carrying about a dozen migrants to the temporary shelter at 6420 S. University Ave. Around noon, a second bus arrived but its path to the school was soon blocked by two male residents.\u00a0Wearing a bright yellow jacket, Andre Smith, who is running for 20th Ward alderman against incumbent Ald. Jeanette Taylor, and Luis Cardona, who lives in Woodlawn, stood in front of the bus for about an hour in protest of the city moving forward with the shelter despite opposition from the community.\u201cThis is a CTA bus. This is our tax dollars,\u201d said Smith as a dozen or so police officers looked on. \u201cWe (refuse) to move because the (city) did not work with the community, and we\u2019re not working with them.\u201dAs both men refused to budge, the bus driver reversed the vehicle down University Avenue and took an alternate route on Greenwood Avenue to another entrance.\u00a0According to a mayoral spokesperson Thursday afternoon, about \"100 men and women moved into Wadsworth. Due to capacity levels, these individuals were relocated from other facilities.\u201dAt a January community meeting about the shelter\u00a0with city officials, Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) Commissioner Brandie Knazze said the city plans to house about 250 men and women in the school for two years, after which the building will be turned back over to Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0Most of the repurposed school's inhabitants will be\u00a0Venezuelan asylum seekers, but it will also provide shelter to\u00a0unhoused local residents.Security contracted by the city will be on the premises 24/7, and an 11 p.m. curfew for those living at the shelter will be instituted. Chicago Police Department officers will also check the building frequently, paying \"special attention\" to the campus, according to\u00a0Roderick Watson, CPD's\u00a03rd District commander.The use of Wadsworth as a shelter is part of the city\u2019s response to the more than 5,100 migrants who have been bussed to Chicago from Texas and Colorado since August 2022. Another 1,500 people similarly seeking refugee or asylum status have also arrived to the city independently in that time.The city has so far set up 14 temporary housing accommodations in decommissioned libraries, vacant schools, churches and park facilities across the city. But new arrivals are coming every day, a spokesperson from\u00a0 the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS), and the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.But plans for the shelter have been met with significant pushback from many Woodlawn residents. At the January community meeting, dozens of residents expressed exasperation to city officials at the project\u2019s moving ahead without community input and in a neighborhood many said the city has neglected for decades.Thursday's sudden move-in also comes after repeated delays of the shelter\u2019s opening and ongoing confusion from the city as to its plans. On Monday, a mayoral spokesperson told the Herald that the administration still had \"not determined a firm date on when this space will open for shelter for all those in need of support.\u201dOn Thursday, the mayoral spokesperson did not\u00a0answer additional questions from the Herald as to the shelter's\u00a0capacity, how long it will be used for and if there was communication from the city to residents regarding the move-in.Ald. Taylor issued a long statement that afternoon, noting Woodlawn's history as a home to Black Chicagoans displaced by gentrification and the complicated interactions between Black and Latino Chicagoans through the city's history. She said Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration has pitted the Black and Latino communities against each other again \"through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands.\"Taylor said she wants Woodlawn to get resources in light of the systemic racism it has experienced from the city in the past and for Chicago \"to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life.\"She also included a list of demands for the city in the statement, among them that 50% of hiring and contracting for the shelter to go to Woodlawn residents, businesses and organizations and for the Wadsworth building to be turned into a long-term community resource, alongside other community benefits.The Chicago Police Department\u2019s 3rd District weekly community meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 10 a.m. at the South Side YMCA, 6330 S. Stony Island Ave. District Cmdr. Roderick Watson has scheduled another meeting for Feb. 16 to discuss the Wadsworth situation. Taylor\u2019s office is to have its own meeting on Feb. 16 as well.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Candidates for 5th Ward Alderman participate in a forum\u00a0at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023.ReporterCandidates for 5th Ward Alderman participate in a forum\u00a0at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023.Fifth Ward aldermanic candidates have differing housing and development proposals, but the 10 who showed up to a Sunday, Jan. 15 forum agreed that trees in Jackson and South Shore Park should stop getting cut down.But much more of the debate at the forum, organized by the group Save Jackson Park and held at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., focused on homeownership, protections for renters, reparations for Black residents and development.Economic development and housing affordability in the 5th Ward have long been concerns for constituents. But as investors buy more property around Jackson Park, especially in South Shore, gentrification worries have soared.Tina Hone, a former chief engagement officer for Mayor Lori Lightfoot, suggested that one means of combating displacement in South Shore is to make it easier for renters to become homeowners.\"The reason that people in South Shore are so vulnerable is because 77% of them are renters. The way that you free yourself from an unethical landlord is to not have to have a landlord,\" she said, suggesting more no-down-payment programs and more amenable mortgage-repayment programs.Down the forum\u2019s table, Gabriel Piemonte, a former Herald editor, countered that the solution to bad landlords isn't to buy a house: \"The solution to bad landlords is criminal prosecution, or maybe it's a civil suit. But one way or another, the problem is the landlord, not that you're a renter and you need to do better.\"He continued that economic development cannot happen without displacement and that policies should therefore be oriented around closing the racial wealth gap.That would include things like the South Side Community Federal Credit Union he helped found, and he suggested investing in financial cooperatives, perhaps by temporarily putting municipal funds in them to spur investment. He also called for a city-wide evictions moratorium, adding that it could be accomplished locally through \"individual interventions.\"Kris Levy, a South Shore wine and spirits distributor, and Hone both went on the attack against Piemonte, criticizing his outspoken support for reparations for Black Americans.Hone called reparations \"the ultimate economic enfranchisement,\" but questioned its feasibility. \"It's easy to say 'I'm going to fight for reparations.' Tell me how you're actually going to get there,\" she said. \"It's easy to say stuff, and it is way harder to talk about how you're actually going to get it done.\"She also accused Piemonte, who is white, of trying to \u201cout-Black everybody Black.\u201dRenita Q. Ward, an attorney, defended Piemonte, saying, \"If we look at the redistribution of wealth and we take into account systematic racism in this country, it is most-appropriate that Mr. Piemonte be the first and foremost to be talking about reparations and the redistribution of wealth from those that it was taken from.\"Ward went on to say that the panel's discussions around wages, affordable housing and small business support are \"all conversations that talk about putting liquid assets in the hands of people who need them the most\" and that the next alderperson would have to realize that support into reality.Other candidates stuck to their own backgrounds and platforms.Adrienne Irmer, a commissioner of the South Shore Special Service Area, said her first priority in office would be to foster inter-ward dialogue with other alderpersons whose wards cover specific community areas; she noted that Hyde Park and South Shore will be covered by three wards and that six wards divide Englewood.\"That is how you divide and dilute the power of a community and bleed it of resources, and leave it vulnerable to real estate speculators to fundamentally change the fabric of that community,\" she said. She proposed creating a comprehensive development plan for South Shore with the alderpersons of the 7th and 8th wards alongside similar plans for Greater Grand Crossing and Woodlawn.Desmon Yancy, a South Shore police accountability activist, noted that renters and homeowners alike deal with bad banks, unethical developers and house-flippers.He suggested that there be pathways to ownership through things like low-interest loans and mortgage assistance, alongside ordinances that prevent landlords from evicting tenants for any reason besides nonpayment of rent. He also suggested working with community-development corporations that do things like buy vacant properties for people to develop.Yancy also pointed to his past minimum wage activism and said he supports a $25 minimum wage and an increase for tipped workers' wages, saying, \"We can increase the money that people are bringing home so that there is more money at the end of the month than there is month.\" He also supports employer tax credits for hiring formerly incarcerated people.Levy said South Shore needs rent and property tax protections for its renters and homeowners as well as long-term subsidies to prevent eviction or mortgages. He also wants a trade school and business corridor in the neighborhood. He also advocated for the Obama Foundation to sign a community benefits agreement (CBA) for South Shore.Hone said every community in the ward has opportunities; in South Shore, she said \"on-the-precipice\" 71st Street needs parking. She proposed enlisting recently out-of-incarceration people to clean streets early in the morning, saying, \"You can't build a destination if it's filthy, and 71st Street right now is filthy.\"Wallace Goode, former head of the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, called for a comprehensive \"Marshall Plan\" for the ward targeting all affordable housing, violence and the wealth gap at once. He noted that his campaign is based around economic development, education, the environment, youth engagement, health care access and criminally targeting of gun-runners.Marlene Fisher, a cybersecurity administrator, said people should be asked why they do not want to become homeowners and that Section 8 voucher-holders should be made to take financial literacy programs and housing simulations as a requirement of the program.She recalled realizing as a tenant that her $800 rent was akin to a mortgage payment. So she sacrificed: \"Sometimes, you've just got to pull up our pants and do it. We've got to go without. We've got to save our money, build our credit so that we can afford to buy houses. I'm not going to make excuses; everyone can do it.\"Jocelyn Hare, who works for the U. of C.\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, said her experience as \"a mixed-race queer girl\" made her \"understand what it's like to be unseen, be unheard, to be exposed to violence and trauma at a very young age without the support and resources I needed.\"\"Too many folks feel this way. You need somebody who understands these impacts,\" she said.And Dee Perkins, a corporate tax auditor, said she is already a community resource for people who need public and private social assistance. \"I'm not a community activist; people just feel comfortable with me, and they know that I get things done,\" she said.Candidates Joshua Gray and Robert Palmer did not attend.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Dorchester Ave.The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015Woodlawn residents gather for a\u00a0heated meeting with city officials about the Wadsworth migrant shelter on Thursday night, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015After several delays of the city\u2019s plan to house migrants in a repurposed Woodlawn school, hundreds of residents gathered for a community meeting last week to voice their frustrations and demand answers from officials.During a heated two-and-a-half hour meeting Thursday night, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave., city officials presented their latest plan for housing migrants, most of which are Venezuelan asylum seekers, at the vacant Wadsworth Elementary School, 6420 S. University Ave.These plans were met with significant pushback from residents, who later in the evening took to the microphone \u2014 or raised their voices from the crowd \u2014 to express exasperation at the project\u2019s moving ahead without community input and in a neighborhood many said the city has neglected for decades.\u201cThis is beautiful, to go in and create a shelter for people \u2026 But what about the people who have been here for the last 20 years?\u201d said Keith White, a 25-year resident of Woodlawn. \u201cWhy is it just now that (Wadsworth) is being fixed up?\u201dAs of now, the city plans to start moving about 250 men and women into the school starting the week of Jan. 23. The school will be used for about two years, after which the building will be turned back over to Chicago Public Schools. There will also be a \u201cprogressive increase\u201d of individuals housed at the shelter; the city does not yet have an official capacity limit.(When the city first proposed this plan in late October, 20th Ward Alderman Jeanette Taylor \u2014 whose ward includes the shelter \u2014 reported that she was informed that the city was working to repair the building to provide accommodations to upwards of 500 people.)Security contracted by the city will be on the premises 24/7, and an 11 p.m. curfew for those living at the shelter will instituted. Chicago Police Department officers will also check the building frequently, paying \"special attention\" to the campus, according to\u00a0Roderick Watson, CPD's\u00a03rd District commander.He added that the campus\u2019 parks and walking paths will remain open to the public and security cameras will be installed around the school\u2019s vicinity.As for supports, health care and mental health services, english classes and connections to support networks \u2014 such as faith-based organizations \u2014 will be provided to the asylum seekers by the city. Case management services will also be provided daily on site.\u201cShelter is not the last step on the journey, we want people to go out into (other) housing, so we\u2019re helping them work through that next step,\u201d said Brandie Knazze, the commissioner for Chicago\u2019s Department of Family and Support Services.Since Aug. 31, more than 5,100 people have arrived in Chicago from Texas, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) buses migrants out of state in protest of federal immigration policies. Some asylum seekers have also begun arriving on busses from Colorado and another 1,500 have arrived independently.The city has so far set up 14 temporary housing accommodations in decommissioned libraries, vacant schools, churches and park facilities across the city. But new arrivals are coming every day, Knazze said, and the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.Plans for the Wadsworth shelter have been delayed several times since first announced in mid-October, when Ald. Taylor was informed that CPS spent $1.5 million on plumbing, heating and other rehab work at Wadsworth. On Oct. 25, the mayor\u2019s office announced that there were \u201cno plans\u201d to use Wadsworth as a temporary shelter. Months later, on Dec. 28, Taylor reported being \u201cblindsided\u201d at a community meeting the city held in Woodlawn, where the mayor\u2019s office once again said it was planning to use Wadsworth as a shelter; she requested more meetings to take place before people moved in. On Jan. 6, the mayor\u2019s office announced that plans were once again delayed.Over the last few months, many residents at Thursday\u2019s meeting said, the city was not transparent about its plans nor did it seek community input.\u201cI know we didn\u2019t get the ask right the first time before we came before you, and for that I am truly sorry,\u201d said Knazze. \u201cThat oversight was a huge mistake.\u201dBut many weren\u2019t satisfied with just an apology and questioned the point of the meeting.\u201cNothing I say here tonight is going to change anything, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said White.Taylor spoke briefly at the beginning of the meeting, reminding the audience that: \u201cit is not about \u2018(migrants) versus us,\u2019 because at the end of the day the system is mistreating all of us,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThis is about making sure that this situation that is being pushed upon us is safe for everybody.\u201dAt the end of the meeting, she took to the podium again. \u201cFolks do not want this in the community \u2026 and this conversation is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cTo Mayor Lori Lightfoot, y\u2019all are going to learn to listen.\u201dYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S.

  "text": "Just before the League of Women Voters Chicago 5th Ward aldermanic forum at Montgomery Place, 5550 S. Shore Drive, Sunday, Jan. 8ReporterJust before the League of Women Voters Chicago 5th Ward aldermanic forum at Montgomery Place, 5550 S. Shore Drive, Sunday, Jan. 8Twelve candidates are running to replace retiring 24-year incumbent Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) on City Council. They pressed their candidacies and addressed policy issues at a Sunday, Jan. 8 League of Women Voters Chicago forum at Montgomery Place, 5550 S. Shore Drive.All candidates support the municipal landmarking of Promontory Point and reestablishment of the Chicago Department of the Environment. All but one said they support \"streamlining city and county public transportation agencies\"; Dee Perkins said she was unsure about the issue, pending information from the agencies.Marlene Fisher: A cybersecurity administrator, she noted the construction of housing in Woodlawn with 30% affordability set-asides and the number of empty lots where housing could be built.

Said the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS) should be reimagined.Jocelyn Hare: Longtime Hyde Park and neighborhood homeowner; said closing small businesses and rising rents motivated her 2015 run against Hairston. Concerned about prices for tenants and homeowners rising because of the OPC, which she said should be addressed with \"resources.\" Wants to focus on supporting small businesses as well as fostering local entrepreneurship through job incubators. Proposes establishing a ward council to vote on positions related to local issues. Wants to engage the community for its opinion on public schools and to visit local schools.Tina Hone: Said her commitment to civil rights, social justice and equity stems from her lived experience as a biracial person.

Wants programming for CPS teachers to recognize trauma in students and more counselors for the schools. Would recognize the coming elected CPS school board \"as a partner\" with its own authority; noted that the city can put stipulations on the CPS through municipal grants.Adrienne Irmer: Noted her experience in city, county and state government; she was a special assistant to the Beverly Hills, California, city manager, a legislative coordinator for Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and a member of former state Sen. Kwame Raoul's (D-13th) staff. Currently a member of South Shore's special service area (SSA) and directed money to the neighborhood's commercial corridors. Said the OPC\u2019s diverse hiring and contracting bodes well for future economic development once the center opens and that corresponding economic development and preparation for local small businesses should be going on now. Would allocate TIF money to benefit local entrepreneurship and to help fund CBA-bound developments. Said she would \"amplify\" the policies of the coming Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability and elected police district councils and do oversight over police hiring in order to have officers that reflect district demographics. Would attend LSC meetings and forge relationships with representatives. Would support CPS school board candidates with support from residents and teachers, not those \"supported by corporations\" who support charter schools.Kris Levy: A wine-and-spirits company sales coordinator, native South Sider and 15-year Jackson Park Highlands resident, he said his private sector management skills would benefit the ward; public safety, economic development and community services are his top issues. Concerned about current ward residents benefitting from OPC. Would decide how to spend ward TIF money with community involvement, in light of often-competing affected local interests. Wants more youth programming in neighborhoods. Wants more police foot patrols and to target loitering in local businesses.Robert Palmer: The special education/diverse learners teacher, Special Olympics and baseball coach, and Chicago Teachers Union member said ward residents are tired of not receiving adequate city services or effective communication with the government, largely depending on what area the residents live in.

She wants to have a \"community-peer patrol team,\" ward-wide WiFi, a website for ward residents, protections for seniors, youth engagement and the encouragement of entrepreneurship and local development. She is a corporate tax auditor and professional boxer. Wants more transparency for TIF funds and the use of those funds for homeowners to buy vacant properties to rehabilitate them. Her patrol team would consist of volunteers and employees, tasked with being present in the community to prevent crime. Said charter schools that receive public funding \"should be treated like public schools.\u201dGabriel Piemonte: The former Herald editor who ran against Hairston in 2019 wants discussions of public safety to include discussions of employment and housing insecurity, noting high evictions and the high homicide rate in South Shore. He would focus on Black Chicagoans' housing crisis in terms of eviction, foreclosure and high property tax assessments. Wants a more accountable CPD, in light of its annually increasing budget and relatively low rates of solving criminal incidents. Said the Obama Foundation \"has never felt like they have to listen to us\" and that the OPC should never have been built in Jackson Park. Concerned about diverse-hiring practices at the construction site, particularly the number of African Americans working there. Complained about the deteriorated Stony Island Avenue bus line service because of construction. Called charter schools \"a disaster for the public school system\" that should be systematically dismantled, with exceptions for those \"that are working now.\" Called the CPS appropriations system \"a disaster\" and wants to abolish TIFs.Renita Ward: A U. of C. Divinity School graduate and attorney for Northwestern Medicine, she said her professional background would enable her to perform an alderperson's myriad duties. Is focusing on youth, economic development, education and responsive, efficient government for the ward. Said OPC-related transportation development will depend on the aldermanic office and community being good partners while holding the Obama Foundation accountable. She would garner feedback from communities recognized to have been affected by systemic racism to see what policies and resources they need. Wants a tighter strategic partnership with the CPD, the U. of C. Police Department, local block clubs and community organizations. Cautioned against closing charter schools to which enrolled students may be attached.Desmon Yancy: The labor and community organizer and policy advocate was part of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) coalition that mobilized to pass a significant police accountability ordinance in City Council in July 2021. Said he is running out of concern for Black Chicago's future. Wants city capital for Black-owned small businesses and city resources like tax credits or job-training programs for formerly incarcerated people. Would work with the forming community commission and police district councils, established by that 2021 ordinance, to foster better police-community relations. Disappointed, as a South Shore resident, about the closure of Cornell Drive and thinks the Obama Foundation has not been communicative about the OPC's effect on transportation; supports \"much more robust\" community engagement thereof, instituted by the aldermanic office. As a former schoolteacher, he is against charter schools and said adequately funding CPS would negate their need.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

The city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201d He is seen above next to the former Pioneer Bank at North Avenue and Pulaski Road, a site for city redevelopment.Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who oversees a revitalization effort there, criticized the relatively limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have received much more.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades.\u201d\u00a0Amalia Nieto Gomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, says: \u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Bill Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez, a community organizer who took part in the city's Invest South/West planning process, called it \"a facade, it's a veneer. The city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201d He is seen above next to the former Pioneer Bank at North Avenue and Pulaski Road, a site for city redevelopment.This story was originally published by the Illinois Answers Project.When Joyce Brown was told the Invest South/West program was coming to her South Shore neighborhood, she and other residents did just what city officials told them to do \u2014\u00a0they started making their wish lists.Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s highly touted program plans to spend $750 million citywide in neighborhoods starved for investment and development, and Brown hoped some of that money could build up the community where she has lived for nearly 40 years. A grocery store here. A dry cleaner there. A new bakery for residents.\u00a0Instead, Brown says after numerous back-and-forth debates during community meetings with city officials, her South Side community is getting housing it didn\u2019t ask for.\u201cWe were told [the city] can\u2019t build those things until people come,\u201d Brown said about her suggestions. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is preserve my community.\u201dWhen the mayor unveiled the program just months into her term, she extolled the initiative as the city\u2019s best effort to bring public and private investment and development to 10 neighborhoods that have received little of it in recent decades.\u00a0Lightfoot promised a collaborative, \u201ccommunity-based planning and development strategy that will ensure equitable investment in the South and West sides.\u201d\u00a0Without it, South Shore and the other nine community areas would likely continue to go without major developments.Many residents have praised Invest South/West\u2019s goals of revitalizing long-neglected Chicago neighborhoods. The initiative has given hope to neighborhoods and energized them, they say.\u00a0But interviews by the Illinois Answers Project with almost two dozen stakeholders and community groups reveal a common thread of complaints. While the city vowed to involve locals, residents say they\u2019ve felt shut out of any real decision-making.In a process that was supposed to be transparent, it\u2019s often unclear, residents say, how the city selects winning projects. Even some alderpersons say they\u2019ve been left in the dark.\u00a0Stakeholders worry that winning developments are often about dollars and cents \u2014\u00a0what is the most financially viable with the least cost to the city \u2014\u00a0while neglecting the community\u2019s wishes. Despite assurances from the city that it wants to bring in new, smaller developers to the table, some of those firms say they\u2019ve lost out to the familiar, bigger players who appear favored by the city.Community stakeholders in at least four Invest South/West target neighborhoods said city officials overrode their requests and chose anchor developments that didn\u2019t have strong community backing.In South Shore, the long-neglected intersection at 79th Street and Exchange Avenue will become home to a $47.3 million project including housing, retail and a museum space to be built by a team including the Chicago developer responsible for Englewood\u2019s Whole Foods, now shuttered.In Auburn Gresham, some residents criticized city officials after Lightfoot announced the selection of a $43 million affordable housing development in early 2022, despite a wave of requests for commercial businesses.\u00a0\u00a0On the West Side, Austin community groups flagged a selection process they called unfair to neighborhood-based developers. Ultimately, the city chose a $37.5 million project to renovate the former Laramie Bank to include a blues museum, bank branch, caf\u00e9 and business incubator.\u00a0And for one Humboldt Park site, the city broke a tie between two proposals, choosing what one resident called a \u201cvague\u201d plan for a $53.9 million rehabilitation of the former landmark Pioneer Bank.Those stakeholders and others said the goals of Lightfoot\u2019s plan are on target, but the execution diminished their optimism about its outcome.\u201cA lot of people ended up saying, \u2018At least we\u2019re getting something.\u2019 But why promise people things then do what you want to do anyway?\u201d Brown asked.Many of the details of how the city picked winners and losers remain unclear.\u00a0The city has refused to release many documents related to the program, including such basic information as detailed responses from developers, the top three plans for each site and even who sat on most of the selection committees. The Better Government Association, the publisher of the Illinois Answers Project, is suing the city to obtain those records after the city denied or ignored Freedom of Information Act requests for them.Peter Strazzabosco, a spokesman for the city\u2019s planning department, said it \u201cvalues all public\u00a0comments and suggestions during RFP [requests for proposal] development and review\u201d and other suggestions from residents are \u201cbeing fulfilled\u201d through city grant programs.\u00a0Ultimately, some requests aren\u2019t reflected in final projects because of concerns surrounding financial viability, he said.\u00a0\u201cSome neighborhood goals, depending on the area, are not feasible during this phase of Invest South/West due to local market conditions that preclude private-sector participation,\u201d Strazzabosco said in a written statement. \u201cInvest South/West is intended to improve local market conditions so all neighborhoods enjoy similar private and public amenities.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The city announced Invest South/West in October 2019 and held kickoff celebrations featuring fanfare starting in December.\u00a0The celebrations drew alderpersons, organizers and community members enthusiastic about having the chance to sit at the table with city planning officials, rather than \u201chaving the city come down\u2026 and tell communities \u2018we're doing this for you, and we're doing it this way,\u2019\u201d which Lightfoot described as \u201cthe wrong way to do anything\u201d at the one-year celebration of the program in October 2020.Residents were excited to tell the city what they envisioned for blighted business corridors in their neighborhoods, completing surveys and needs assessments provided by the city.\u00a0Some residents, like Brown, showed up not just with community wish lists but with corridor studies and existing quality of life plans \u2014 to show they\u2019d already done their homework and knew their communities\u2019 needs.The city convened roundtable processes, led by officials from the Department of Planning and Development and other city departments, to \u201censure the neighborhood voices are heard and integrated into the priorities\u201d of the initiative and hear feedback, according to the city.\u00a0In the months following the mayor\u2019s announcement, Planning and Development Commissioner Maurice Cox publiclyechoed the idea that existing community plans would be the cornerstone of Invest South/West developments.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe in top-down planning,\u201d Cox told Curbed Chicago in December 2019. \u201cPeople cannot come from the outside and tell a community what to do.\u201dEarly on in the community roundtable process, the city said it had three main evaluation criteria for Invest South/West proposals, focusing on building community wealth, \u201cprofessional competence\u201d of developers \u2014 a category that includes responding to community priorities, design excellence as well as innovation and creativity \u2014 and the economic feasibility of the potential project.\u00a0Beyond those criteria, the city has provided little additional details.As Lightfoot announced winning project bids, residents say they saw no scorecards, no breakdowns of ownership or equity structure for the winning developer and project, and there was scant explanation as to why the winner was selected.\u201cThe roundtables are a start at engagement, but if all we're doing is presenting to a table of folks but there\u2019s no involvement in the decision-making and no explanation then it's falling short,\u201d said Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who runs a neighborhood revitalization effort there.Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who oversees a revitalization effort there, criticized the relatively limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have received much more.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades.\u201d\u00a0DPD first activated the initiative in three neighborhoods. In August 2020, the city released requests for proposals for project sites in Auburn Gresham, Englewood and Austin, and the process that followed was contentious.\u00a0In Auburn Gresham, community residents pushed back on an affordable-housing development initially selected by a committee that critics said did not represent neighborhood voices.Ald. David Moore (17th) held an emergency meeting where attendees scolded city officials, saying they needed to worry less about bringing new people to Auburn Gresham and more about keeping business in the neighborhood.Moore told Illinois Answers that roundtable meetings with DPD mainly included neighborhood groups with existing ties to City Hall, and residents may feel left out because city officials \u201cdon\u2019t want so many voices in this meeting that [they] don\u2019t get any progress.\u201dBut according to Moore, the neighborhood campaign challenging a low-income housing plan was \u201cdetrimental\u201d to community support for a plan that he ultimately thinks will provide more sustainable housing options for residents in his ward.\u00a0Janetta Pegues, an active resident of the Englewood community who attended Auburn Gresham\u2019s roundtable meetings, said she was frustrated that more moderate voices weren\u2019t amplified to \u201ccounter those who were insistent on pushing this narrative that really wasn't reflective of the whole community.\u201d\u00a0The $43 million development, spearheaded by the Imagine Group and Evergreen Development, broke ground in August.\u00a0Strazzabosco said in Auburn Gresham alone there were 30 community meetings on the request for Invest South/West project plans.\u00a0To address community concerns about \u201cpotential over-development\u201d of the initial location, a second site was added to provide additional public amenities and the city is offering incentives to help reopen a Save A Lot grocer \u2014 a response to community input, he said in a written statement.In Englewood, a coalition of community organizations, dissatisfied with city plans, partnered with Ald. Stephanie Coleman\u2019s 16th Ward office to strategize how to fund and support existing development concepts in the community.\u00a0Asiaha Butler, co-founder and CEO of Englewood\u2019s resident association, R.A.G.E, said Coleman\u2019s process has been more inclusive than the city\u2019s which \u201cdoesn't feel like a roundtable, it\u2019s a table where the city is just throwing out information.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it just from working in Englewood \u2014 [the Department of Planning and Development] just operates as its own entity with developers, sometimes with aldermen, sometimes with communities, sometimes not \u2026 they work with who they need to work with \u2014 whether that be the community or not,\u201d Butler told Illinois Answers.On the city\u2019s West Side, longtime organizers like Jackie Reed, former CEO of the Westside Health Authority, say that Lightfoot\u2019s and Cox\u2019s approach excluded residents and community groups in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0The Austin-based development organization Reed is involved with bid on the Invest South/West site at West Chicago and North Laramie Avenues but lost and protested for months after the winning proposal was announced.\u201cThey act like they have community support but they have not had that support,\u201d Reed said.Of the 21 members of\u00a0 selection committee that awarded the Laramie State Bank site to Heartland Housing and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, all but one were city employees at the time, according to city records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.The city denied a request for similar records for the other Invest South/West neighborhoods. In a written statement, a spokesman for the planning department said three \u201ccommunity-based evaluators\u201d were part of subsequent project proposal review processes after the first three sites were chosen.\u00a0Athena Williams, head of the Oak Park Regional Housing Center, said when the request for proposals was first released she went to groups, including Westside Health Authority, to form a partnership.\u00a0That group told her they didn\u2019t need partners for their bid and ultimately Heartland Housing was the only group that wanted to partner on a proposal.She didn\u2019t hear a lot of pushback on the submitted plan and she \u201ctalked to a lot of individuals.\u201d Williams said she\u2019s urged Heartland to do community meetings to hear from residents and ensure the project continues to address what\u2019s needed most. Despite complaints, she\u2019s excited for what the project could provide to the community.\u201cThis is stellar \u2014 this is unseen support that should have happened many administrations ago,\u201d Williams said of Invest South/West. \u201cAt this point, the fact that my project has received roughly $39 million from the city \u2013 the West Side has not seen that during my existence. Let\u2019s celebrate that.\u201dAld. Emma Mitts (37th) told Illinois Answers that she initially thought she\u2019d have more leverage in selecting a winning bidder for the Austin project but was not made privy to the city\u2019s decision-making process. Mitts said COVID-era restrictions made for a rocky start to the city\u2019s engagement efforts but hoped things could now improve.\u00a0After the first round of requests for plans was released, the city changed its model for engagement to include a community resident on the committee responsible for selecting the winning project.Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, said the process in her community is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Her organization has teamed up with others to comment on the city\u2019s new master city plan, especially as it concerns developments.\u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done,\u201d Nieto Gomez said.Amalia Nieto Gomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, says: \u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Others who spoke on the condition of anonymity said engagement efforts were often one-size-fits all and failed to meet the unique needs of each community.Some community meetings lacked Spanish translators. The city at times did little outreach beyond sending emails to established groups. Seniors received limited technical assistance to complete online surveys that were often their only chance to provide feedback.Strazzabosco said the organization that provides the city\u2019s private translation service has \u201cbeen unreliable for certain events, due to staffing issues,\u201d but officials are working to \u201censure these meetings have the relevant translation available.\u201dBeyond the community meetings and publishing the requests for proposals, the city emailed residents who expressed interest in participating, hosted other meetings related to the Invest South/West project \u201cupon request and through sister agencies\u201d and summarized milestone and spending information in annual reports in its efforts toward transparency, Strazzabosco said.Some involved in the evaluation process question whether proposals that don\u2019t excel in a category focused on putting money back into the community but ask for the lowest amount of city financing get preferential treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Shaka Rawls, principal of Leo Catholic High School in Auburn Gresham, said when the city invited him to participate in discussions about things like youth centers, local retail and sit-down restaurants, he expected that input to be reflected when a winning development was announced.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is not what happened,\u201d he told Illinois Answers. \u201cIt\u2019s a funding issue. Now it\u2019s \u2018how do we fit this round peg in a square hole?\u2019\u201dCity-backed projects are often harder for smaller developers to secure because they have to ask for more financial support.\u00a0Christyn Freemon, a consultant to a development team that lost out on one project, says as long as city departments like planning and others consider that a weakness of these proposals, community-based developers will continue to be left out.\u201cThe process is not as inclusive or equitable for smaller developers,\u201d Freemon said. \u201cIf we're talking equity the city should be willing to make a bigger investment in a place that it has disinvested in for years.\u201dIn response to criticism that small developers were not a bigger part of Invest South/West, Strazzabosco said in a written statement projects that \u201cmay have addressed community needs but were otherwise non-viable\u201d were not selected.\u00a0\u201cA primary goal of Invest South/West is to support minority and emerging development entities that reflect the communities in which they are building,\u201d Strazzabosco said.Many Invest South/West sites feature familiar developers who have worked on some of the largest or more prominent projects in the city, despite the city\u2019s promise to cast a wider net.In Humboldt Park, the city chose two business corridors \u2014 one on North Avenue and another on nearby Chicago Avenue \u2014 for development.\u00a0That meant two roundtable processes for community members to pick a site and creating \u201ca community-driven survey \u2026 to see what the community wanted,\u201d said William Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez, who participated in the North Avenue committee.Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said the planning department\u2019s request for proposal release marked a change in the community\u2019s relationship with the city.There were two main bids the selection committee considered, he said. One hit all the bullet points of the RFP the community worked together to create, while the other was \u201cvery vague \u2026 but asked for less [tax increment financing] money.\u201dThe two proposals received nearly the same score from the evaluation team, records shared with Illinois Answers show.\u00a0Ultimately, the department of planning awarded the North Avenue project to Park Row Development, All Construction Group and JGMA. That group \u201cdidn't really know the community and didn't really do much to engage with the community\u201d prior to submitting the bid, Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said.Engagement was limited to mostly communicating with Ald. Roberto Maldonado (26th) and a representative from the Puerto Rican Cultural Center rather than with the community at large, Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. Neither JGMA nor Maldonado responded to requests for comment.\u201cInvest South/West is a facade, it's a veneer,\u201d Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201dJGMA, along with Park Row Development and All Construction Group, will create the Team Pioneros project, a $53.9 million planned rehabilitation of the vacant Pioneer Bank, filling it with an entrepreneurial incubator space, Latino cultural center, and office space for JGMA, according to the city.JGMA has developed the Chinatown branch library and the Humboldt Park Wellness Center. The group was recently chosen to develop the city\u2019s casino.\u00a0Another site north of the bank will also be redeveloped to include 75 affordable residential units, offices for Humboldt Park Family Health and a potential library branch, according to the city.Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the process and its outcome, in the end.\u201cThat\u2019s my critique of Invest South/West,\u201d Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe city tries to be about equity, but, when you push them on that, you realize what they really want to see is growth and sites that make money versus the community groups pushing for things that are better for their communities.\u201dIn North Lawndale, the city selected as the developer Related Midwest \u2014 known for luxury apartments and condos as well as for building the city\u2019s $7 billion \u201cnewest neighborhood\u201d the 78 \u2014 to develop a site with 548 Development, an MBE-certified \u201cup-and-comer\u201d in the city\u2019s development world, Cox told the Chicago Sun-Times.That 20.8 acre development will include two community centers and public, open space featuring art and a solar-powered industrial complex, according to the city.A plan for another site in the neighborhood, which will be a collaboration between GRE Ventures, Imagine Group and 548 Development, features 60 mixed-income apartments, three market-rate townhomes, as well as retail and restaurant space, and a community center.Imagine Group is part of the development team on the Invest South/West Auburn Gresham apartments planned for Moore\u2019s ward.KMW Communities and LG Development, in a $19.2 million joint venture, will develop a project chosen for Bronzeville\u2019s business corridor, called The Legacy District, along with Bronzeville Community Partners, according to the city.\u00a0That project on a city-owned corner of 47th Street and Vincennes Avenue is slated to include 12,000 square feet of commercial space and 25 mixed-income residential units. The project is slated to create 174 permanent jobs and 140 construction jobs.KMW and LG are likely best known for their home and apartment developments. KMW submitted the winning proposal to build The Ave. on West Chicago Avenue in Humboldt Park.DL3 realty, which developed the now closed Whole Foods in Englewood, was chosen to develop the Thrive Exchange project in South Shore along with Revere Properties and Claretian.\u00a0\u201cIt seems to be the same developers, it\u2019s always the same big dogs, it\u2019s never the little developers in the city,\u201d Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to the people, we don\u2019t try to spread the wealth in the city \u2026 they don\u2019t really value what the people in the community think.Taylor said the city\u2019s approach to Invest South/West \u201cexposes that we\u2019re not as transparent and not as community friendly as we should be.\u201dAld. Pat Dowell (3rd) said the city and developers on the Legacy District project have \u201cdone very little to engage the community\u201d or her office on the anchor development coming to her ward.\u00a0While she likes that the city has tried to engage the community through the roundtable process, she remains concerned about delays.\u201cThe Invest South/West concept is good, what it's trying to achieve is needed on the South and West sides, but at least in my community it's been short on results,\u201d Dowell said.The initiative has been slow throughout the 10 communities chosen for development, as reported by Crain\u2019s Chicago. The first of the flagship developments, in Auburn Gresham, didn\u2019t break ground until last August.\u00a0Despite the slow start, Lightfoot\u2019s mayoral campaign featured a clip of her and others in an ad breaking ground at that development among others as part of her push to convince city residents she deserves another term.For most people active in the 10 communities targeted by Invest South/West, this isn't the first time hearing political promises of revitalized city-owned lots and revamped business corridors \u2013 what have been an eyesore for longtime residents who once knew those areas as thriving hubs.\u00a0While the mayor\u2019s initiative is still in its early stages, the work and plans to bring business back are decades old. Some who spoke with Illinois Answers say their frustration with city officials has only been exacerbated by Invest South/West \u2013 seeing a missed opportunity to not just offer a place in the conversation but also in the decision-making.\u00a0A South Shore resident since 1989, Jacquie Jakes-Johnson said she's attended every meeting for the Invest South/West project coming to her neighborhood and was invited by Ald. Greg Mitchell to join the committee overseeing the Thrive Exchange project earlier this year. The roundtable hasn't met since September, she said.She said there's a \"50/50 split between people who are excited ... who believe in this development\" and others who \"say we get promised these things and funding is always yanked back.\"DL3 Realty, which will build the Thrive Exchange, revised its proposal and added a bodega to the plan, signaling to Jakes-Johnson that the company did listen to the community.Mitchell is working on bringing a grocery store to the area and the condos that are slated to be built will \"bring in more people with disposable income, and you need that in order to bring in more of the things residents need in South Shore,\u201d Jakes-Johnson said.But when she thinks of the funding available through Invest South/West, Jakes-Johnson questions whether it\u2019s fair.\u201cWhen I think about the limited amount of funding, especially for South Shore, it's not equitable because other areas do receive what appears to be unlimited TIF-funding while we are barely scraping the barrel to get the necessities we need to thrive and keep going,\u201d Jakes-Johnson said.Loyd and others who spoke to Illinois Answers took issue with the limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have gotten many more dollars.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades,\u201d Loyd said.Craig Chico, the head of the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council which manages the corridor project for New City, said the reality is \u201c[the city] can't give everything to everyone, and some requests and desires aren't relevant to what this money can be used to do.\u201dThe city chose Chico\u2019s council as well as other community-based organizations to work with its agencies and local partners.\u00a0Each gets an $80,000-a-year contract over five years funded by tax increment financing dollars from the districts along each development corridor.Chico, whose family moved to Back of the Yards in the 1920s, an area that falls in the boundaries of New City, said he watched the commercial areas \u201ckind of die\u201d over the years as malls moved in but people, and other businesses, moved out.He\u2019s not an expert as to where the money \u201cis going and where it\u2019s coming from, but it\u2019s spotlighting areas that need it.\u201d\u201cWhen this corridor was dying and rotting and there were vacancies, no one paid attention to it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a priority,\u201d Chico said, adding that the neighborhood\u2019s project, called United Yards, is \u201cone of the key pillars to get people to stick around\u201d or come back to New City.Having that cornerstone will allow the city and community to \u201cfocus on other pieces like safety and economic development,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m hoping this can be more sustainable,\u201d Chico said. \u201cYou can't invest in one community at the expense of another. Not every community is going to be Sauganash, but all should have basic amenities for people to feel good about where they live. [This initiative] is more than just a financial investment, it's a life investment.\u201dMalcolm Crawford, corridor manager for the Austin area, said he believes city officials have \u201cthe right intentions and I think that change is coming.\u201dAlong with the redevelopment of the old Laramie Bank building, the city also plans to revamp adjacent land with a mixed-income, multi-story rental building that includes a green roof, public plaza, social spaces and outdoor art.Tucked between Oak Park and West Humboldt and Garfield Parks, disinvestment in the Austin community, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, made it a prime target for Lightfoot\u2019s effort.\u00a0But Crawford, who is the executive director of Austin African American Business Networking Association, said the mayor\u2019s attention has brought excitement to his West Side community.\u201cWe\u2019re [one of] the largest community [areas] in the city and for years we\u2019ve gotten the least resources and that\u2019s evidenced by what we\u2019ve seen for years,\u201d Crawford, a 20-year resident of the area, said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the potential of what can happen in the community and I believe something has to happen.\u201dThe winning project for Austin\u2019s Invest South/West corridor is a renovation of the Laramie Bank building and is expected to create 150 construction jobs and 22 full-time jobs.He brushed aside criticisms of the initiative as forcing communities to fight over a limited pool of funds or continuing the top-down development process that has plagued the city\u2019s neighborhood projects saying \u201csomething beats nothing.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never had the amount of a voice that we have now,\u201d Crawford said.\u00a0Loyd, the Bronzeville resident, said neighborhoods like his lack the resources to address the basic needs of residents.\u00a0He said the goal of the Invest South/West initiative is \u201cright on\u201d because communities need \u201cmuch more systematic\u201d levels of investment, but Bronzeville and others tagged for projects need even greater levels of investment for the program, and their neighborhoods, to succeed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe fundamental issue of Invest South/West . . .\u00a0 is, until we can create vibrant communities of color, Chicago will never be truly successful.\u201dContributing: Emeline PosnerThis article first appeared on Illinois Answers Project and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015For the second time after reports of the imminent opening of the former Wadsworth Elementary, 6420 S. University Ave., for migrants, Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration says \"the city has not determined a firm date on when this space will open for shelter.\"\u201cAs a welcoming city, we are committed to receiving asylum seekers with dignity and respect. We have worked with county, state, local leaders and community-based partners to explore all options for temporary shelters to respond to the urgent needs of our new arrivals. The city is continuing to engage with the Woodlawn community and is committed to carefully balancing the needs of both our residents and new arrivals,\u201d spokesman Ryan Johnson said Friday in a statement.Senior communications officials in the mayoral administration have declined on-record interviews on the subject.The Texas government has sent thousands of migrants over the past months to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 so named because their local law enforcement departments do not enforce federal immigration laws \u2014 like Chicago, which has taken in nearly 4,000 migrants and asylum seekers in this way since August.A meeting with Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.Jennifer Maddox, who is running against Taylor in the 20th Ward aldermanic election, organized a rally of about a dozen people on Thursday morning, Jan. 5, to protest the decision to house migrants in the old Wadsworth school.\u00a0\u201cWe are tired of being shut out and dumped on as residents in Woodlawn and the South Side,\u201d Maddox said in a statement.Taylor distanced herself from the protest, during which a speaker who declined to self-identify suggested that the migrants instead be housed in the majority-Latino Little Village neighborhood, the Chicago Tribune reported.\u201cThis type of localized nationalism does nothing to uplift working class communities of color and only feeds the worst of right wing politics,\u201d State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) said Thursday in a tweet about the protest.\u00a0But Taylor did articulate a sense of frustration that Woodlawn, with its decades-long problems around homelessness, blight and substandard delivery of social services, was being asked to host a facility she said it is ill-prepared for.\"What I want us to think about is, these folks have already been through a traumatic experience. We're going to take them another one without having the resources and real support for them?\" Taylor asked. \"The city has a responsibility to have sanctuary for everybody, for all. So I hear people on both sides, but this is not a time for us to pit Black and brown against each other.\"She noted the sprawling 20th Ward's Latino population, in Back of the Yards, as well as the solidarity among Latinos and African Americans in her days of activism against school closures. (She noted that Wadsworth was one of the public elementary schools the city closed in 2013, which she said \"traumatized\" the surrounding community.\")\"The thought that this country is just busing people to different states because they don't want to be bothered says something about this system, and we're just caught up in it in our emotions,\" Taylor said.The alderwoman wants residents and institutions of the area around the Wadsworth building to have input in the planning. She is also having a closed meeting on Monday with representatives of the Chicago Police Department and Chicago Public Schools as well as selected local stakeholders.\"People are watching this and seeing that I'm the sacrificial lamb for this, and what I say can make or break me, because either 'I'm not Black enough,' or 'I don't like migrants.' I'm being thrown under the bus either way.\" Taylor said. \"I get Black people's anger altogether, because I'm that person. If I'm nothing else, I'm a Black woman first. But that does not make me hate any group of people. That does not make me say 'don't take care of them.' We're caught up in this thing because the City of Chicago has not done its due diligence with its own homeless population.\"\"We cannot be fighting each other because of something that we're inheriting. Folks from El Paso are sending these buses to Chicago intentionally, but that does not mean we don't work together and come up with a plan that makes everybody safe and that everybody understands,\" she said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Kam Buckner debuts his new mayoral campaign headquarters at 5401 S. Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.Kam Buckner debuts his new mayoral campaign headquarters at 5401 S. Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.In October, Chicago Police Department officer who had been investigated for affiliating with the white nationalist Proud Boys organization was found to have given false statements about it and given a 120-day suspension.A reporter subsequently asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot about why the department had not fired an officer affiliated with the far-right, anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic organization that participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol; Lightfoot said that characterization was overstated.Two years ago today a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to take down democracy. This mob included the Proud Boys \u2014 an extremist group Mayor Lightfoot excused in October when she said it was an \u2018overstatement\u2019 to call them anti-Semitic and anti-gay, and defended the Chicago Police Department\u2019s decision not to fire an officer with known links to the Proud Boys.Mayor Lightfoot cannot even say once what I\u2019ve said multiple times since that moment in October: Proud Boys have no place in our police department. Period.Public trust in the police is at an all-time low, and it\u2019s a slap in the face to every CPD officer dedicated to constitutional policing to have a mayor who defends Proud Boys\u2019 racism.There\u2019s a clear difference between Mayor Lightfoot and me: She defends the indefensible while I\u2019m inclined to action. But today is the perfect time for her to right her wrong and apologize for brushing off the very real danger of far-right extremists infiltrating the ranks of those who are meant to keep us safe.Buckner, a local state representative since 2019, is running for mayor.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "title": "Desmon Yancy, South Shore police accountability activist, running for 5th Ward alderman",
  "text": "Desmon YancyReporterDesmon YancyOne of the public faces of the successful campaign to create an elected board for civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department, Desmon Yancy is running to be the next alderman of the 5th Ward.Yancy, who co-founded and is the spokesperson of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the subsequent Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) coalitions, has long been involved in work around police accountability and public safety.\"We've still got a long way to go in a city that's had issues around policing on paper since the 1960s and, with this current consent decree and the failures of the city to meet these deadlines, it's clear that it's a big boat to turn around,\u201d said Yancy. \u201cBut I'm happy to do my part.\"Born in the 8th Ward and a 1989 graduate from Kenwood Academy, Yancy is the son of a Chicago policeman who worked on Harold Washington\u2019s mayoral campaign and a mother who did medical billing and was an active volunteer with their church. After spending a year at DeVry University, he worked in sales and served in AmeriCorps VISTA, as a teacher's assistant at Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St., in the mid-1990s. He said the experience showed him the difficulties schools face when they are not adequately funded.In 2007, he got into union organizing with SEIU Healthcare and eventually created a program there that taught labor leadership and organizing.\"The gist of it was really to make sure that union workers could go home to their communities and provide the same leadership,\" Yancy said. \"When you're thinking about the housing crisis, when banks abandoned homes in formerly great neighborhoods, or fighting to raise the minimum wage across the city, these leaders played often-key roles in organizing their own community outside of the union work.\"He worked with SEIU until 2013, leading canvassing teams with the union in support of both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in Chicago, Northwest Indiana and Wisconsin. In 2014, he worked on a local voter registration project with 13 coalition partners, which he described as both challenging and \"a first taste of how important it is for organizations to work across the city in order to have change.\"Following the police murder and coverup of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in fall 2014, a coalition of community organizations came together to form Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability in 2016. Yancy was a co-founding member of the coalition, and would become its policy coordinator.Over the years GAPA, in partnership with groups like the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), other public safety coalitions and community organizations, would push for the City Council to create a platform for civilian oversight of the police. In July 2021, City Council created the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and 22 district councils, elected for each of the city\u2019s police districts.\"A lot of it was 'slow and steady winning the race' and being true to your convictions, especially when we ran up against opposition from Mayor Lightfoot,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cShe was fully in support of our proposal for police oversight in Chicago and then at a point got cold feet, because she thought that district councils would have too much power\u2026 But we stayed true to what we felt was really a key principle of the work that we were doing, which was transparency and accountability.\u201dShould he be elected alderman, Yancy would like to push the city towards creating more policy accountability and oversight, which he said is still lacking even after the commission and councils' creation. He named outgoing Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th), Roderick Sawyer (6th) and Harry Osterman (48th) as well as Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and North Side Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) as particularly hard workers behind the July 2021 measure. But Yancy said more needs to be done to support it behind the scenes.\"Like I said, I'm the son of a police officer, but at the same time I've been working on police accountability for the last six years,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cI certainly understand the work that needs to be done and look forward to being able to support that work on council.\"Lightfoot appointed seven interim commissioners in August; Yancy said he has been working with them to develop talking points about issues like the police budget. He said the interim CCPSA is looking to make an immediate impact. It will eventually play a role in hiring and removing a police superintendent, Police Board members and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) chief administrator, as well as approving departmental general orders, enacting its own policies and supervising the department, COPA and the Police Board.Asked how he would work with law enforcement in the 5th Ward, Yancy noted that he worked with the CPD in passing the oversight ordinance. \"Those conversations aren't easy, but they're important,\" he said. \"It's a slow process to get the police department bought into police reform efforts.\"He said police are largely responding to rhetoric like \"defund the police\" but he can work with them, with his personal background and his perspective that law enforcement is a partner in public safety that should not be othered.Neighborhood safety \u2014 residents' safety and police officers' safety \u2014 should be paramount as individuals in either group do not currently feel safe, Yancy said.\"It is helpful when police officers hear issues from people who have families deeply impacted by police misconduct,\" he said. \"One officer I was talking to who was in leadership at the time told me about how he, as a teenager, was assaulted by a police officer, which motivated him to become a police officer.\u201cThere's more to it, and as long as we look at it from our polls and don't look at it in terms of what the actual goal is, which is public safety, then we're going to have a much more difficult time.\"He wants to have the authority of an aldermanic office to motivate those conversations with more people, to do away with fear and build community support \"for the right efforts.\"Yancy is currently directing organizing and advocacy for the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, overseeing and facilitating the organization's policy and advocacy agenda. He continues to live in South Shore and is the father of an 8 year old.Promontory Point is one of their favorite places to walk, and Yancy is concerned about South Shore lakefront property owners affected by the lake's erosion and flooding. He called Hairston's July-passed South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance, \"a great start.\" He said more programs like it are needed, especially ones that are easily accessible to everyday people.Asked about constituent services, Yancy talked about modernizing the 5th Ward office. He would seek to hire young staffers to engage youth around things like political education, aiming to decrease distrust in government, as well as longtime 5th Ward residents, to add credibility to the office. He also talked of creating an \"office-on-wheels\" to bring constituent services to all four neighborhoods the ward covers.\"There's some level-setting that needs to be done with constituents,\" he said, setting the goal to under-promise and over-deliver. \"I think there are many constituents who think that alderpeople have particular power in their wards that they don't.\"Hyde Park's commercial corridors look different than South Shore's, which are beset by empty lots. \"As we look at that and look at the lack of employment, there's a direct correlation,\" he said. \"I would love to see grants or funding to small businesses, to capitalize them.\"As construction continues on the Obama Presidential Center, Yancy said he would like to see a mix of national and local businesses flourish along Stony Island Avenue, similar to 53rd Street's commercial mixture.\"I would just love for South Shore, Woodlawn and Greater Grand Crossing to feel like the same sort of community,\" he said. \"I know it's not anything that's going to be achieved in one, two or even three terms. However, I think setting the groundwork legislatively to ensure that those funds are there to capitalize businesses, offer some business support and use the weight of the office to encourage economic development will be important.\"Yancy wants to ensure the ward is attractive to new families and college graduates as well as longtime residents. He called for a balance between affordable housing and transit-oriented developments to curb runaway inflation in housing costs. He would like to see something like Hairston and Taylor's Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance for South Shore.Mental health is another issue of importance to Yancy. He said more resources should go into homelessness prevention, particularly in Woodlawn and South Shore. That call for equity would also include funneling resources to the ward's schools, so that, as he put it, Revere Elementary School, 1010 E. 72nd St., and Murray Language Academy, 5335 S. Kenwood Ave., could perform at the same level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Woodlawn Ave.ReporterLeft to right: county Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her wife, First Lady Amy Eshleman, at the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence in Hyde Park on Sunday at Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave.Mayor Lori Lightfoot endorsed the effort underway by some Democrats in the state legislature to ban assault weapons in Illinois at a Sunday night vigil for victims and survivors of gun violence at Augustana Lutheran Church.All local state legislators and Gov. J.B. Pritzker support banning the weapons in Illinois. A House committee held a meeting on Monday on a bill by Rep. Bob Morgan (D-58th) \u2014 whose district includes North Shore suburb Highland Park, where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens more at a 4th of July parade with an AR-15-style semi automatic rifle \u2014 to ban assault weapons and other high caliber weapons. Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) is co-sponsoring that bill.\"As we solemnly recognize the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy, this is our opportunity,\" she said, noting the 1 million Americans who have been killed or wounded by gunfire in the decade since the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. \"This of course is an absurdity that in this country, with all our wealth, with our economy, that we can't solve this problem that plagues every community in our nation.\"She teased a city pilot program to provide more support to gun violence survivors in addition to banning assault weapons, saying it's about accountability and \"making sure that we're doing everything possible to make our communities safe.\"The Illinois General Assembly is considering a bill to ban assault rifles statewide in its January lame duck session. In a Monday interview after a state House committee's subject matter hearing on the topic, Buckner noted the Sept. 13 mass shooting in Washington Park that killed two and wounded seven more. No assault rifles were used then, and Buckner said discussions at the meeting included what to do about handguns modified with \u201cswitches\u201d to function like automatic weapons.Those are already largely illegal in Illinois, though criminals are altering those guns at home, often with parts bought online. Buckner got legislation passed earlier this year banning \"ghost guns,\" unserialized weapons often sold as a kit for at-home construction.\u00a0\"I don't know if that's going to actually make its way into this bill, but I think for communities where violence has plagued us for a very long time, that is a pertinent conversation that people are starting to bring up,\" Buckner said. \"I think we're a way's off from what the final piece of legislation will look like. We've got a chance for some amendments, fixes and some things that will make it more palatable to folks, and more effective. But I think that the appetite is definitely there.\"Buckner said he thinks legislation against gun switches would help, but he said he wants to have more conversations with violence-interruptors and law enforcement about how such a ban would work in practice.State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) spoke of the exhaustion that he and other advocates and policymakers face after years of mass shootings that make national news and \"shooting on the streets due to gang violence.\"\"We've been advocating the same solutions over and over and over again,\" he said. \"I'm tired of the fact that our approach to gun violence is to point at the community. Interpersonal violence is of itself a problem, but it is not the only problem,\" he said. \"Every time a bullet hits somebody, that is somebody's stock price going up. Every time there's a mass shooting, you look at Wall Street, and an investor is making a buck. It keeps happening, and those same people, those same investors, tell us, 'It's an individual's fault. It's your community's fault.'\"There is a clear correlation between mass shooting events and spikes in gunmakers' share prices. Peters said assault weapon bans would \"go after the fault of the problem: there are people making money hand-over-fist in this country when it comes to gun violence.\"Peters also said public safety means access to education, jobs, housing and transportation, not lock-them-up carceral policies. He praised anti-violence legislation in Illinois, which funds third-party programming in youth intervention services, violence interruption and trauma treatment. And he praised the University of Chicago Medical Center's new legal services for trauma victims (see story on page 7), saying more initiatives like that are necessary.The Rev. Nancy Goede, pastor of Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave., hosted the vigil. Her local colleagues Rabbi David Minkus of Congregation Rodfei Zedek, 5200 S. Hyde Park Blvd., and the Rev. Veroica Johnson of Hyde Park Union Church, 5600 S. Woodlawn Ave., who chairs the Interfaith Anti Violence Task Force of Hyde Park-Kenwood, also spoke.Johnson prayed to comfort victims' families, friends and communities. \"Unless we lament, which simply means 'cry out honestly about our pain,' we run the risk of normalizing this violence. We run the risk of getting numb by it and not getting moved by it,\" she said.\"Refuse to be silent,\" she said. \"Refuse to be silent about your loved ones. Refuse to be silent about guns. Refuse to be silent about all the causes of violence, including the historical lack of investment in our communities and young people. Cry out from your souls, and refuse to be silent.\"Chicago Survivors, which helps families affected by gun violence, organized the event. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Cook County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) and representatives from anti-violence and grief support organizations also spoke.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A view of Promontory Point from the northwest, August 1, 2021.\u00a0ReporterA view of Promontory Point from the northwest, August 1, 2021.\u00a0The Promontory Point Conservancy has requested that the Commission on Chicago Landmarks list the historic peninsula park as a city landmark, preferably at its Dec. 8 meeting.The request comes after more than a year of renewed advocacy efforts by community groups for a preservation-based approach\u00a0to needed repairs at the Point, instead of the replacement of limestone revetment with concrete and steel, as has been done along much of Chicago's shoreline.Though a preservation-based approach has been endorsed by elected officials \u2014 local Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th),\u00a0\u00a0Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot \u2014 a landmark designation also gives the Commission authority to review building permits for landmarks, to ensure that any proposed alterations will not negatively affect the character of the landmark.Beyond maintaining the Point's historical value \u2014 the limestone revetment dates back to 1939 \u2014 the conservancy argues that preservation of the stone steps is also be cheaper. The nonprofit points to three\u00a0locally commissioned studies from the early 2000s that found that preservation would cost less, be stronger and more aesthetically appealing than dismantling the limestone and replacing it with concrete.\u00a0The conservancy issued the draft report by preservation and urban design consultant Julia Bachrach for its request, which details the Point's history and argues for its listing as a city landmark.The report begins with the Point's conception in the 1890s by Daniel Burnham and eventual construction in the mid-1930s, when the federal government gave funds to the Chicago Park District to build it. Workers drove timber pilings bound together with steel into the lake bottom, after which construction debris and sand was used to form the peninsula. The step-stone limestone blocks were put into place around its perimeter.Prairie School architect Alfred Caldwell planned the landscape, head park district architect Emanuel V. Buchsbaum designed the park's pavilion, and a private donor commissioned the Wallach Fountain, by husband-and-wife sculptors Frederick C. and Elizabeth Haseltine Hibbard. The park opened in 1939.Anti-war activity around the placement of the Nike missile site in Jackson Park and a radar area on the point, installed in the 1950s, led to their removal in the early 1970s, and an activist group, \"Friends of the Promontory Point,\" began pushing for renovations in the mid-1980s.The landscape and pavilion were restored in 1989 and 1990, respectively. The work to save the Point's limestone began in the 1990s; the Park District, city and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would eventually plan a $300 million replacement of revetments along the entire lakefront. Activists opposed the replacement of the limestone with concrete and steel throughout the 2000s, but no federal dollars came for a preservation approach. The conservancy achieved its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.Bachrach\u2019s report says the Point meets several criteria for inclusion on the city register. It has value, she says, as an example of city heritage as part of Burnham's \"1909 Plan of Chicago\"; its limestone revetments are an enduring example of the city's \u201cpioneering and sustainable coastal engineering projects\"; and South Siders have enjoyed it for decades.She calls it a work of important architecture, in terms of both the architects attached to it and because of its Prairie School landscape and retainment of some of the city's last stepped limestone revetments. And she argues it is a distinctive visual feature along the lakefront with a high degree of historic integrity.An agenda for the Commission on Chicago Landmarks' Dec. 8 meeting will be released to the public this Friday.\u00a0Herald editor Hannah Faris contributed.\u00a0herald@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Michigan Ave. Per a March needs assessment conducted by the center, residents of the Near South Side, Bronzeville, Douglas, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Fuller Park and Washington Park said that the \u201cmost desired services\u201d were group and individual counseling, followed by education programs and youth services.These centers are a direct result of the 2011 Community Expanded Mental Health Services Act, which gives residents the ability to create community funded and approved mental health centers under the city\u2019s Expanded Mental Health Services Program (EMHSP).\u00a0Members of the Coalition to Save Our Mental Health Centers and other area groups have been organizing to re-establish fully funded centers since 1991, when Mayor Richard Daley closed seven of the city\u2019s 19 public mental health centers. In 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel closed half of the remaining clinics. Of the five centers still operating today, only one is accessible on the mid-South Side: Kenwood\u2019s Greater Grand Mental Health, 4314 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0The groups said they gathered signatures the last two summers in order to get the referendum on the ballot.\u00a0Though the location has yet to be determined, in an August interview with Herald, Rebecca Jarco, assistant director of the coalition, said the location will be centrally located and accessible by public transport.\u00a0Similar referendums to establish a community mental health clinic also appeared on the ballot for residents of West Town, which residents passed with 85.43% \u201cyes\u201d votes.\u00a0Next steps include the creation of a governing commission of nine residents and two mental health professionals, appointed by Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, to manage the funds and assess needed services.Arteberry said that creating the center is a \u201ctwo to three year project,\u201d and that the commission will also be tasked with selecting the location and holding public meetings.\u00a0George and Tanger Fielder, South Shore residents who organize with the coalition, said that community needs will include treatment for post-traumatic stress disorders from community violence, depression and the stress that comes from living in poverty.\u00a0\u201c(The referendums) sets a good and effective precedent for a way to engage the community to address its own needs, and even to go a step further, to help provide the funding that we do need for our own situations that need to be remedied,\u201d George Fielder said.\u00a0\u201cThis could be a good vehicle to use in the future, so that we\u2019re more connected to the political system, and we don\u2019t have to feel like people in political offices can\u2019t hear us or can\u2019t attend to our needs,\u201d he added.\u00a0staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th)The City Council Committee on Public Safety has voted down the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified bans on no-knock warrants and other sweeping changes to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s search and raid policies.\u00a0The committee voted 4-10 to reject the ordinance in a Nov. 10 hearing, despite the testimony of its namesake at the meeting.Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th), a committee member, introduced the ordinance in February 2021 with the backing of the other Black women in the council\u2019s Progressive Reform Caucus, including local Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th).The ordinance was introduced after a botched raid that affected social worker Anjanette Young in 2019. During the raid, multiple male officers entered her house incorrectly on a no-knock warrant while she was nude, ignoring her protests that they had the wrong location for 40 minutes. (The council approved a $2.9 million settlement for her last December after national outcry that the city was stonewalling its recompense.)\"Do the right thing,\" Young said at the November hearing, recounting the continuing mental health harm that the raid has caused. After the loss, Young told reporters that the fight would continue until the ordinance passes.In March 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CPD leadership introduced policy changes requiring teams of officers to identify any potentially vulnerable people like children who may be at a site where they have a warrant. Guns are not to be pointed at children. Investigations leading to warrants must be documented. Warrants also require independent investigations to verify that information used to obtain them are accurate, with a review for wrong raids.\u00a0No-knock warrants are banned unless lives or safety are in danger; the Sun-Times reports that their use has been \u201csignificantly limited.\u201dWest Side Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th) opposed the ordinance but fulfilled his 2021 promise of letting it come up for a vote before the committee he chairs.The Lightfoot administration argued against the ordinance, saying the CPD policy reforms were enough and that the federal consent decree monitors wrong and flawed raids. Hadden and University of Chicago Law School Professor Craig Futterman dismissed this, saying that the consent decree did not conflict with the ordinance.After the hearing, Taylor, who is not on the committee but attended its meeting, said that the vote showed that some alderpersons \"have not learned anything\" despite the reckoning that the nation has endured over race and police violence since 2020.\"They don't care about anything, and they definitely don't care about the people they represent. And they're not thinking about accountability,\" Taylor said. \"This is not me hating the police. This is not you being disrespectful to the people who are paid to serve and protect us. This lady is clearly telling you, as a social worker, what she's been through, how the city hasn't contacted her for any services or anything.\u201d\"They don't care,\" she repeated. \"This is why the police get to do what they do. This is why they get away with stuff, because they're not held accountable. They're made to be seen like they're above the law.\"Taylor discounted the CPD warrant policy changes, saying they did not meet the gravity of the moment and that police accountability promises are repeatedly broken. She said she could have called parents to testify about the police raids conducted in their homes in front of young children.\"We would have been devastated to hear how those young people feel. But we don't do that, because we don't want to know the truth,\" she said.The ordinance would have required a 30-second wait for police before they entered after knocking and for them to avoid with \"all available measures\" executing a warrant when children younger than 16 were present. Police would not be able to handcuff or point guns at children, and they would not be able to restrain or handcuff their parents or guardians unless they were immediately presenting a threat of physical harm. Pointing guns at adults would have been prohibited unless the target was an imminent threat of death or injury.The alderwoman is running for reelection next year and said she will continue advocating for the ordinance.\"I will never stop fighting for change. What am I here for? I could have stayed a community organizer,\" Taylor said. \"The fact that I have to fight with my coworkers for what is right in and around these communities is a problem.\"Looking ahead to the 2023 mayoral election, Taylor said she wants a mayor who is open to dialogue, conversation and collaboration with alderpersons: \"I want a person who will sit down with us and compromise.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (9th) chairing the Nov. 9 City Council Education Committee meetingThis story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.Some Chicago alderpersons want school district officials to meet with City Council quarterly, but a proposal to make that happen failed to pass Wednesday, Nov. 9.Under the ordinance, the measure would have temporarily withheld city money for certain school projects if Chicago Public Schools officials didn\u2019t show up. That turned out to be a deal breaker for many aldermen on the committee, which held a virtual meeting Wednesday.The vote was tied \u2014 and therefore, failed \u2014 with seven voting in favor and seven voting against.\u201cI currently have three projects in the hopper and I don\u2019t want to get in the way of my own best interest,\u201d said Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza (10th), a former school counselor and Chicago Teachers Union member. She said quarterly meetings are \u201cnot a huge ask.\u201dAld. Sophia King (4th), who is running for mayor, put forward the ordinance during a committee meeting after being frustrated with the district\u2019s lack of response to her budget questions.\u201cThe threats of resources being withheld could very easily be waylaid, if CPS would just show up,\u201d King said, noting that she reached out to district chief Pedro Martinez \u201cquietly and subtly\u201d to try to get questions answered about the school district\u2019s budget \u201cto no avail.\u201dChuck Swirsky, senior advisor to Martinez, called it a \u201charmful ordinance\u201d that would jeopardize school construction and infrastructure projects.\u201cYou have our numbers, and we answer each time you call and I mean no matter what time of day it is,\u201d Swirsky said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly value the genuine relationships and partnerships that we have fostered with City Council members.\u201dBut Chicago Public Schools officials rarely appear before aldermen in public meetings. The Committee on Education and Child Development also rarely meets, despite attempts by council members to call meetings.It was the first time King led a meeting as the vice chair of the Committee on Education and Child Development, which has been without a leader since June when Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th) resigned to take a job in the private sector. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has since appointed Scott to the school board and attempted to appoint an ally and bypass King.The discussion comes after a report, prepared by the district with help from a consulting firm, released last week outlined the costs the city could shift to the school district once it transitions to an elected school board. It outlines hypothetical cost shifts on everything from school construction funding to water bills to summer programs.The city already started shifting costs to Chicago Public Schools in 2020 when it started requiring the school district to pay into a city pension fund that covers some school employees.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "text": "Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th, right) speaks to Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd, left), chair of the City Council Budget Committee, and Ald. Sophia King (4th), Monday, Nov. 7ReporterAld. Leslie Hairston (5th, right) speaks to Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd, left), chair of the City Council Budget Committee, and Ald. Sophia King (4th), Monday, Nov. 7On Monday, Chicago City Council voted 32-18 to pass Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s $16.4 billion 2023 budget. Like the City Council, local alderwomen were divided.Alds. Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th) both voted to pass the budget at the Nov. 7 City Council meeting, while Ald. Sophia King (4th), who is challenging Lightfoot for her mayoral seat in February, voted against.\u00a0The council also narrowly voted 29-21 to pass the mayor\u2019s property tax levy, which does not include a property tax hike to keep up with the rate of inflation, which Lightfoot had initially proposed in September.Notably, it's the first of Lightfoot's budgets Taylor has supported and the last budget Hairston will have voted on before ending her 24-year aldermanic career.King, speaking from the council floor, agreed with the budget\u2019s supporters that there were good things included in it, namely hundreds of millions to pay down the city's pension debt and for housing, but said it fell short on meeting the city\u2019s priorities, specifically public safety.\"I do not think that this budget addresses gun violence in a significant way,\" King said, noting an allocation of $85 million last year towards public safety, most of which has not been spent by Lightfoot\u2019s administration.Only $5 million of that $85 million in the last budget has been spent. King said alderpersons have asked the administration for details about anti-violence spending but have received none in turn. (She suggested the city spend $200 million on those efforts.) She said she herself has asked for more information about city funding for Chicago Public Schools but has received none.King said there should be money set aside for jobs training for young men of color, trauma-informed care and non-police responses to certain mental health 9-1-1 calls for service \u2014 all anti-violence initiatives \u2014 but that there is none. And she complained, alongside other alderpersons, that no Department of the Environment would be established in this time of climate change, something the mayor had campaigned on creating in 2019.\"This budget is not equitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThe resources, especially this year in our budget, spent towards African American contracting is down.\"\"Even low-hanging fruit, like having blocks in Black and brown communities just be clean \u2014 those are our city blocks..\"Taylor, for her part, said she was happy to see Black organizations get anti-HIV funding and to get an assurance that the Chicago Torture Justice Center, a Woodlawn nonprofit borne out of the city's history of police torture that plans a memorial for its victims, will get $250,000 in funding.\"They would raise $2 million \u2014 I got that in writing,\" Taylor said of the city's promises, adding that she was also happy to see no rise in the city's property taxes. But she still said that the city needed to do a better job in equitably funding street repairs in her ward and others like it, observing that South Side wards are bigger than North Side ones, due to lower population density, though funding levels do not recognize these physically larger areas.\u00a0As alderpersons pontificated on the floor before the vote, Hairston claimed in an interview that \"a lot of the comments being made are being made by people who didn't actually attend the budget hearings (and) did not submit amendments to the budget.\"Hairston said she has worked to get a transfer of the $15 million the city allocated in July for at-risk and in-need-of-repairs South Shore condominiums and co-ops.\u00a0\"Anybody can hold a press conference and say something. Actually getting it done is different,\" she said. \"The work is at the beginning, the middle and the end to make sure that everything is tied up to make sure that it actually happens.\"Hairston actually voted against the budget in committee last month and said her vote was motivated by the city making efforts to fix long-identified infrastructural issues in the 5th Ward. \"That doesn't discount the rest of the budget,\" she said.Despite the divided vote, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), who chairs council's Budget Committee, received widespread acclaim from her peers at council for her leadership during the process.In her statement after its passage, Lightfoot praised the city's continued ratings upgrades from Fitch, purchasing of hundreds more emergency vehicles and millions of dollars for new police equipment, station renovations and public safety cameras. The budget ups the Chicago Police Department funding by $64 million to nearly $2 billion.While a Department of the Environment was not established, an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity was with $1 million in funding. Lightfoot's administration has proposed reviving the Department of the Environment in the coming years.More than $200 million is going to homelessness support services, including the construction of \"supportive\" housing and housing programs. Nearly $90 million was allocated for mental health services. The city has paid down $747 million in its outstanding debt.\u00a0\u201cOver the past three years, we have steered our city through some challenging fiscal storms,\u201d said Lightfoot in the statement. \u201cHowever, each and every time, we came together to collaborate on how to enhance the quality of life for all of our residents, and emerged to become the stronger, more vibrant city that we are today. This budget is a reflection of our hard work and values.\u201dIn her speech to council, Lightfoot said that $2 billion will have been made in economic development programs by the end of the year, touting her Invest South/West initiative.\"From streetscapes to vertical construction, retail, health care, affordable housing, community gathering spaces, and more, these are transformative, catalytic investments,\" she said. \"When we raise the fortunes of the South and West sides, we raise the fortunes of the entire City.\"At the post-council press conference, Cecilia Cuff, co-owned of the Bronzeville Winery, 4420 S. Cottage Grove Ave. in the Invest South/West 4400 Grove project, praised the mayor for her investments. (The winery received city funding.)\"I'm sure that funding like the Invest South/West initiatives has acted, for other businesses across Chicago, like a springboard,\" she said, praising the public-private partnership for the confidence it gives entrepreneurs and the additional capital it attracts from banks.\u00a0Without it, Cuff said it would have been hard to find funding for \"a space that doesn't seem like it's investment-worthy.\" And she praised the city for improving the neighborhood by developing businesses \u2014 ones where local workers can get paid a good wage in their own community.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Jeanette Taylor (20th) at the groundbreaking of Park Station Lofts at 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue on Nov. 2Cranes and other construction equipment are at work at 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue building the Park Station Lofts, a mixed-income development set to open next fall.\u00a0With around 3,500 square feet of retail, two live-work spaces, a community amenity space and 58 one- to three-unit apartments, Park Station Lofts is also the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance.Seventeen of those open-floor plan apartments will go for the market rate while the other 41 are set aside and priced for low-income households \u2014 renting between 30% and 60% of Area Median Income ($470 to $940 per month).\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a long-time coming, ain\u2019t it y\u2019all?\u201d Ald. Taylor (20th) said at the Nov. 2 groundbreaking. She admitted feeling strong emotions as construction begins on the first affordable housing project of her three-year aldermanic tenure.\u00a0\u201cPeople who want to come back and move to Woodlawn now have a choice. This ain't just about low-income housing; this is about housing for everybody,\" she added.The project is being developed under the conditions of the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Alds. Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th) negotiated with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the City Council passed in 2020 to address concerns about gentrification and displacement in the neighborhood.\u00a0In her speech, Taylor expressed gratitude to the activists and organizers who fought for the Housing Preservation Ordinance \u2014 a process that began with activism for an OPC community benefits agreement. She also thanked the project\u2019s developers, and the Woodlawn homeowners and renters who provided feedback on the project alongside community organizations and churches.\u00a0\"Too often they use us to fight against each other, so this was the first time that we got to see us actually work together. And look at the finished product,\" she said.\u00a0Park Station is being built with $19.4 million in low-income housing tax credits, $5 million in tax increment financing (TIF), and $6.5 million from the city. BMO Harris Bank is providing additional financing for the project's total cost of $35 million.The Michaels Organization, a national affordable and mixed-income housing developer, is developing the property with Black-owned DL3 Realty, 90 E. 103rd St. Brook Architecture, 2101 S. Michigan Ave., is also Black-owned and the project architect alongside Loop-based FitzGerald Associates. Ujamaa Construction, 7744 S Stony Island Ave., and Brown & Momen, 823 E. Drexel Square \u2014 both part of the Lakeside Alliance building the Obama Presidential Center (OPC) \u2014 are the general contractors.DL3, led by managing partner Leon Walker, has been involved in a number of Woodlawn ventures, among them the award-winning Jewel-Osco at 61st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, as well as the new Friend Health headquarters at Cottage Grove and 63rd Street.In his groundbreaking speech on Wednesday, Walker recalled taking the \u201cL\u201d train from the long-since-demolished Jackson Park station at Stony Island Avenue to go downtown to shop. He then said that Park Station, itself a transit-oriented development right next to the Cottage Grove Green Line station, \"will lead a catalytic renaissance in this community.\"\u00a0\"There's something significant here,\" he said. \"Not only is this one of the first projects ever to have a Black developer in the leading role on a 90% tax credit project, but there's also a team with a Black prime (general contractor). We don't see that.\u00a0\"There's a new Chicago in many ways,\" Walker said. \"Yes, we are excited about the families that will be living here in a quality, luxury building \u2026 but it will be affordable to all of Woodlawn's residents.\"B.J. Stewart of Sunshine Enterprises, 503 E 61st St., the nonprofit set to offer business development classes to local entrepreneurs in the Park Station business center, said he was happy to be bringing \"resources that unlock and empower a tremendous force to community transformation\" to Woodlawn.\"Aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners in under-resourced communities face three gaps,\" he said. \"First is a relationship gap. These entrepreneurs don't have the resources and relationships they need to garner the resources that they need.\u201d\u00a0Stewart then identified a knowledge and information and, \u201cmost commonly,\u201d a financial gap caused by a lack of adequate capital. He said Sunshine would host a Business Community Academy to support micro-enterprise startups and early-stage businesses alongside training, coaching and mentorships through its business acceleration service and liaisons to capital.\"Thriving businesses lead to thriving communities,\" Stewart said. \"My team and myself at Sunshine Enterprises can't wait for Park Station to open, providing an additional launchpad for small businesses right here.\"Lightfoot praised Walker for his efforts to spread wealth to Black Chicagoans and Taylor, with whom she has tussled with on several issues in city government, for their shared commitment to getting the project right.\"We knew we had to get it right,\" Lightfoot said, recalling her 2019 community meeting about the OPC, land speculation and displacement at the South Shore Cultural Center, 7059 S. South Shore Drive. \"We had to roll up our sleeves, listen first and make sure that we came forward with community-featured recommendations.\"She called Park Station the \"first of many projects that are going to come to the benefit of the people of Woodlawn\" and her and Taylor's shared concern about the lack of affordable multi-bedroom housing for families. She also noted that residents will be able to go downstairs to the building's businesses to have their commercial needs met.\u00a0She added that the project will create 280 temporary and 12 permanent construction jobs, with hiring priority placed on Woodlawn residents.\"That is also the important investment that the city will continue to make in communities on the South and the West sides, and Woodlawn is going to be the beneficiary of that,\" Lightfoot said.\u00a0The afternoon after the groundbreaking, 50-year-plus Woodlawn resident Larry Johnson praised the project while sitting on an abandoned house's stoop across Maryland Avenue from the project with friends. He noted that the city-owned land Park Station is being built on was once a public aid office where his mother had gotten welfare payments that has since been vacant for decades.\"Look at all the people who are out here who don't have nowhere to live,\" he said, pointing to people sleeping at bus stops and others occupying\u00a0 vacant houses.\"I would love to see more development, because this is what we need. The more developments and things we have would eliminate a lot of homelessness and hanging-out in these old vacant lots,\" Johnson said.\"I don't want to be on anybody's property if I'm not supposed to be on it,\" he added.\u00a0 But \"people need to find somewhere to go,\" Johnson said, observing that life is about change and again welcoming the changes coming to Woodlawn. \"We need the change.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallReporterChicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallYouth anti-violence group Good Kids Mad City (GKMC) filed a federal lawsuit seeking to lift the city\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew for minors on Halloween night. The organization filed the suit so that young activists with the group \u2013 many are younger than 18 \u2013 can safely observe the police and try to keep the peace as they monitor the expected crowds of teenagers who come to 53rd Street every holiday.But at an Oct. 27 press conference, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown said the curfew is unlikely to apply to the GKMC volunteers, as their actions are protected under the ordinance, which includes a protection for youth out past curfew who are engaged in First Amendment activities.\"There's plenty of opportunity in the ordinance itself for them to do exactly what they're saying they want to do,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'll let the court and the lawyers decide it, but there's nothing that prevents people who are active and engaged (from) staffing events from being out in the city. The curfew ordinance doesn't stop that.\"The ordinance, which passed City Council on May 25 of this year, does not apply to minors \"participating in, or returning home immediately after, a ticketed or sponsored event and has documentary evidence of their attendance,\" such as a ticket stub or wristband.\u00a0Minors are also protected if they are expressing their constitutional First Amendment rights, including assembly and the freedom of speech.The lawsuit, however, states, \"Despite the existence of a First Amendment affirmative defense, the text of the ordinance provides no guidance for how a CPD officer should evaluate whether a young person is engaging in First Amendment activity.\u201d\u00a0Per the ordinance a CPD officer can choose to enforce the curfew if they reasonably believe \u2018'that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other circumstances, no defense is present.'\u2019The lawsuit further cites the special order CPD issued after the curfew time was changed, which states that an officer can issue curfew violations when an \u201cofficer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred\" absent the aforementioned protections for youth who were at events or engaged in First Amendment activities. (A carveout for youth commuting to or from work also exists.)The GKMC lawsuit argues that the CPD special order does not give officers a clear process for \"recognizing, inquiring about, and/or analyzing First Amendment activity.\"Activists from GKMC and other organizations like the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights have monitored Halloween in Hyde Park for the past several years. Oct. 31 has seen rowdy crowds of youth come to the neighborhood since 2016. Halloween night in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 saw violence, property damage and arrests; the nights of 2020 and 2021 did not see arrests and were altogether less violent than the previous years.Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) began meeting with the police department-wide leadership as well as the local 2nd District, 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., and the University of Chicago Police Department to craft a less-heavy-handed law enforcement response to the youth disorder. Police began wearing, for instance, regular uniforms instead of tactical gear while patrolling in the neighborhood that night.A key development in the neighborhood has been the \"Collabooration\" effort that began in 2019 and aims to have Hyde Parkers out in front of their homes so that a good-willed and watchful public presence will defuse chaos before it starts. Its founder, local financial planner Bennie Currie, spoke at the press conference.\"We're building community block-by-block,\" he said. \"We have 25 blocks that we call 'activated' in Hyde Park. People like myself in orange shirts are block-activators, and they will be making sure that our residents are Halloween night are being very hospitable, that they have the lights on.\"\u00a0Currie pointed to the planned increased presence on 53rd itself, acknowledging that many of the youth there on Halloween night are from other South Side neighborhoods who come to Hyde Park because of its relative safety.Brown said there will be more officers deployed citywide this weekend than in the past. He said that the response in Hyde Park this year will be similarly collaborative, saying, \"I will point back to the last couple of years, where we've collaborated with Hyde Park and all the stakeholders (and Collabooration).\"\"It cannot be a police-only solution to community safety,\" he said. \"We'll be obviously much more visible and present in collaboration with all those celebrations. We'll be present at the celebrations, where we've been having gatherings, as well as with increased patrols.\"\"Police cannot resolve community safety alone. We need you,\" Brown said. \"We want everyone to have fun. We want you to enjoy being out. But we also want you to be safe.\"After the press conference, Currie said the police do not plan to have a line of patrol cars with blue lights lit up this year and noted that GKMC is partnering with Collabooration this year.\"We're just trying to make sure that we have people doing what we want them to do, to be welcoming and to be giving things to kids and celebrating, creating an atmosphere. And that's really what our focus is,\" he said. \"(Police) told us if something happens, yeah, the blue lights will be on, and I would greatly appreciate that.\u00a0\"But in terms of how they handle the curfew, that's not really what I'm focused on,\" Currie said, noting that most youth are out of the neighborhood by 10 p.m. anyway.The city's online resource with holiday safety tips and activities is chicagohalloweek.org.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th) talks to reporters during the Oct. 26 City Council meetingMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at an Oct. 26 press conferenceReporterAld. Sophia King (4th) talks to reporters during the Oct. 26 City Council meetingMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at an Oct. 26 press conferenceOct. 28 \u2014 This article has been updated to mention that Ald. Sophia King (4th) has set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.City Council rejected by a 29-18 vote an attempt by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to install Uptown Ald. James Cappleman (46th) to head the Committee on Education in its Oct. 26 meeting.\u00a0The proposed appointment bypassed Ald. Sophia King (4th), the vice chair of the committee and acting chair following the June resignation of its previous chair, former West Side Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th). King is running against Lightfoot in next year\u2019s mayoral electionFollowing the resolution\u2019s swift rejection by City Council, King rose to speak, criticizing the vote and the mayor. She also said her repeated requests for Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez to appear before City Council have been ignored.\"This is exactly what people don't want,\" King said. \"You know and I know that I've been asking the CEO of Chicago Public Schools to meet, to have quarterly meetings. That\u2019s 'bringing in the light.' That\u2019s transparency.\u00a0You saw with my colleagues today, they would like to have him come here, because we contribute millions of dollars every year.\"I didn't want to turn it into politics, but that's what it is right now. We really need to have a transparent government where we allow folks to understand and hear from one of the most important bodies in our city, and that's Chicago Public Schools.\"King identified herself as acting chair of the committee and said she assumed that Martinez was not returning her calls upon Lightfoot\u2019s orders.\u00a0Lightfoot in turn denied any knowledge of King's contact with Martinez, admonishing King for speaking about \"what is clearly a political issue for you.\"King said in turn that she had communicated with Lightfoot and her chief of staff over her request, adding, \"Quite frankly, if you would spend more time attacking problems than people, we\u2019d all be better off.\"Lightfoot ruled her out of order, saying that they could talk about the issue but that a council meeting was not the time nor place for it.In an exchange with reporters after the vote, King called the council rejecting the mayor's appointment of Cappleman \"a referendum on her leadership.\u201d She said she has been reaching out to CPS leadership for a date on which the CEO and his administration could report to alderpersons about the state of the district.Changing committee chairs is Lightfoot's administration's attempt to block transparency, King alleged, pointing out the dearth of Education Committee meetings. The committee had only met seven times between May 2019 and April 2022 despite an annual $175,000 budget, Crain's, The Daily Line and WBEZ reported.King had asked Lightfoot to be named chair of the Education Committee in May, after Scott announced his pending resignation. The alderwoman called the mayor's attempted appointment of a new chair \"retribution\" for her attempt to schedule a committee meeting with the CPS leadership.\"It wasn't a political speech. It's true,\" King said. \"I said exactly what people are thinking, that, if this mayor spent the same amount of time that she spends attacking people attacking problems (instead), our city would be much better off.\"In her post-council meeting press conference, Lightfoot said the rejection of her choice for committee chair, an uncommon occurrence, \"is a reflection of the politics that we live in right now.\" She noted that Cappleman, like King, has experience as a teacher and said he has her full confidence.\u00a0\"What happened was politics at work, but we've got to get back to do the business of the people,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'm confident that we will get him approved as Education chair.\"Asked if the council's rejection of Cappleman was less about the alderman and more about the process through which Lightfoot tried to appoint him, Lightfoot incorrectly said her appointment had cleared the Rules Committee the day before.In an interview before the press conference, South Side Ald. Michelle Harris (8th), the Rules Committee chair and mayor's floor leader, whose ward covers a section of South Shore, said the mayor's would-be appointment was directly introduced to the full council, not the Rules Committee.\u00a0\"Generally, every mayor since I've been here for 16 years has introduced their chairmen through this process,\" she said. She said whether she agreed with the process means less than her belief \"that mayors have the right to put in leaders of their choice.\"Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) also voted against the appointment. Ald Leslie Hairston (5th) was not at the council meeting because she is on jury duty.King and Lightfoot have clashed during a council meeting before, in May 2021, when the mayor ruled her out of order as she attempted to call a vote on her proposal to rename Lake Shore Drive for Chicago\u2019s founder, Haiti-born trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. A compromise was reached the next month, renaming the expressway DuSable Lake Shore Drive.On Friday, King set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015It's she-said, she-said with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) about a plan to house hundreds of migrants bused to Chicago from Texas at the vacant Wadsworth Elementary School building in Woodlawn.\u00a0In an email to constituents on Monday, the alderwoman wrote that she learned at an Oct. 20 meeting with the mayor's office and the Department of Family and Support services that the city had identified the former Wadsworth building, 6420 S. University Ave., as a site to receive migrants.That building has been unoccupied for years since the Chicago Public Schools Wadsworth and Dumas elementaries were combined in 2013 and the UChicago Charter School's Woodlawn campus vacated in 2017.Taylor was also informed that Chicago Public Schools was working to provide the building with running water and heat, and that Lightfoot was asking for accommodations for 500 single women and men in the 20th Ward \"for a couple of months.\"Taylor wrote that she looked \"for alternatives that will make this transition more comfortable for our new residents as well as our current residents\" and said Spanish-speaking community organizations were helping her office \"find housing where individuals will be closer to the services they provide and have more independence due to the ease of navigating their surrounding community.\u201d She also admonished the mayor for lack of proper notice or request for community input.\u00a0On Oct. 25, however, the mayor's office announced that there are no plans to use Wadsworth as a temporary shelter. Lightfoot addressed the issue at her post-City Council meeting press conference the next day.Since Aug. 31, more than 3,500 people have arrived in Chicago from Texas, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) buses migrants out of state in protest of federal immigration policies. As it stands, the city has set up temporary housing accommodations in shelters and hotels, though Lightfoot said the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.\u00a0\"The fact of the matter is that obviously since the first busload of migrants, we stepped up as we should, because we are a welcoming city. And we can't be a welcoming city in word only; we have to be that in deed,\" the mayor said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference. \"Obviously as the number of buses came, we worked feverishly \u2014 around-the-clock in many instances \u2014 to make sure that we had adequate facilities to accommodate the residents who were coming from the border to our city.According to WTTW, on Friday, Oct. 24, Lightfoot began asking alderpeople to identify \u201cvacant warehouses or big box stores that could shelter between 500 and 1,000 people.\u201d\"As part of that process, we identified opportunities across our city to open up additional housing and support options, and we looked at a number of spaces, one of which was a closed school in Ald. Taylor's ward,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cThat's where it is: we looked, we evaluated it, we conferred with her and conferred with community members. I'm hoping, frankly, that we will continue to see no more buses coming to our city, but we're going to continue to work hard and make sure that we support the migrants.\"Though Wadsworth is set to remain empty, the proposal stirred up strife and frustration in a neighborhood that has been in a years-long struggle with the city to preserve affordable housing.\u00a0\"We acknowledge the irony of the mayor rushing to create housing in the same community where we have had to struggle with her to meet the urgent call for support from residents that are being displaced due to rising rents and property taxes,\" Taylor wrote in her statement on Monday. \u201cThroughout our push for the Woodlawn Housing Ordinance, the mayor and the Department of Housing attempted to convince us that the city did not have the resources to meet the need for deeply affordable housing with vacant land and properties.\"An earlier version of this article misidentified which Wadsworth Elementary School building was discussed as housing for migrant immigrants. It was the former Wadsworth building, now vacant, at 6420 S. University Ave., not the one the school currently occupies at 6650 S. Ellis Ave. The Herald regrets the error.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Pat Dowell (3rd) listen as Mayor Lori Lightfoot reads a note of congratulations to Williams from the city of Chicago on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0Artist Amanda Williams poses in front of tulip garden beds laid out in the footprints of 21 demolished residential buildings near the intersection of 53rd Street and Prairie Avenue for her new project \"Redefining Redlining\" on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's huge and it seems surreal, but it\u2019s also like you can stand here and see it,\" mused artist Amanda Williams on a brisk Oct. 15 morning as she watched volunteers plant 100,000 red tulip bulbs across several vacant Washington Park lots.The volunteers stooped over the dark topsoil of four brownfields surrounding the intersection of Prairie Avenue and 53rd Street, burying the bulbs six inches below the surface in an effort to dissuade thieving squirrels.The brownfields had been divided by Williams into 21 garden plots laid out in the footprints of 21 residential buildings that had once stood at the sites. Decades ago the dwellings had gone into disrepair and been torn down as a result of redlining, the racist federal practice of mortgage insurance denial that resulted in credit denial to residents of predominately non-white neighborhoods.\"We can't see policy, infrastructure, whatever,\" said Williams, \"but those weird shapes (the residential building footprints), they are just such a strange landscape.\"The tulip plantings are part of Williams\u2019 new project, \u201cRedefining Redlining,\u201d which she explained is being developed in part so that people can both visualize the magnitude of the impact of redlining and see that its impact is manageable.Volunteers from Brown & Son Landscape and Snow Removal plant red tulip bulbs in brownfields surrounding the intersection at Prairie Avenue and 53rd Street in Washington Park on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0Williams, a recent MacArthur Fellow honoree, is creating the project in collaboration with Emerald South Development and its\u00a0Terra Firma\u00a0initiative, which is actively cleaning and beautifying 205 acres of empty lots in the Washington Park, Woodlawn and South Shore neighborhoods.In its\u00a0biography of Williams, the MacArthur Foundation wrote, \"Amanda Williams is an artist who uses ideas around color and architecture to explore the intersection of race and the built environment. Her works visualize the ways urban planning, zoning, development, and disinvestment impact the lives of everyday residents, particularly in African American communities.\"\u201cRedefining Redlining\u201d isn't the first time Williams has put these ideas into practice on the South Side.From 2014 to 2015, Williams \u2013 covertly and without permission \u2013 painted a series of homes in Englewood that were slated for demolition. The paints for her project, \u201cColor(ed) Theory\u201d were saturated and eye-catching, born of a process to develop a \u201cunique, culturally coded, monochromatic color palette based on hues found primarily in consumer products marketed toward Black people along commercial corridors on Chicago\u2019s South Side,\" she wrote in her artist\u2019s statement.\"The project emphasized how colors have socially constructed associations that are inextricably linked to race and class,\" she continued.Photographs of the houses painted during the \u201cColor(ed) Theory\u201d project are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago.All eight of the featured houses have since been demolished.The practice of artists converting vacant spaces into productive and community changing places has a significant history on the South Side.In the late 1990s, the self-taught sculptor Milton Mizenberg took 12 chainsaw-carved wooden sculptures out of his studio and placed them in two empty lots near his house at the intersection of 41st Place and Berkeley Avenue, in Chicago\u2019s Oakland neighborhood. He dubbed the impromptu collection of sculptures The Oakland Museum of Contemporary Art.\"There was a Hell hole here at the time,\" explained Mizenberg in a\u00a0short 2011 documentary. \"It was so terrible that lots and streets were full of cans and bottles.\"\"Something hit my heart and told me... go outside, go outside,\" he continued. \"So I said, \u2018Well, why don't I put some sculptures on these lots with cars sitting around\u2026 And the first thing to do was to get out the door and do it. You can\u2019t do it inside. You got to go out, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201dMizenberg began carving sculptures outside on the lot itself, \u201cin front of people, gangs and everybody,\u201d he added. \u201cI told them this artwork is yours; I don\u2019t own it\u2026 And that's what started me seeing the change in the Kenwood and Oakland area.\"Williams was raised in the city\u2019s Auburn Gresham neighborhood and now lives in Bronzeville with her husband and children.The genesis of \u201cRedefining Redlining\u201d lies in a conversation Williams had with her husband, Jason Burns, about the practice of options trading within commodities markets.During that conversation, Burns used the Dutch Tulip Market Bubble \u2013 also known as Tulipmania \u2013 of the 17th century as an example of how speculative markets function. Inspiration struck Williams.\"This idea of the bulbs, the speculation of the possibility of the bulbs, (just) made sense,\" she said. \"Like you do this thing, and it's going to be this other thing.\"\u00a0It was a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d Williams added, to imagine that one \u201ccan literally make a line (of tulips) to think about redlining.\u201d\u00a0As she thought about the project and a \"groundswell of opportunities\" began appearing that could bring it into existence, Williams said she settled on \"actually showing the houses that should still exist, were that policy not in existence.\"She found the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, which, according to the\u00a0Library of Congress, were produced from 1867 to 1961 and contain detailed information about properties and individual buildings in approximately 12,000 cities and towns in the United States, Canada and Mexico.And since the Sanborn maps \"give us a pretty accurate sense of what buildings were here just at the time that redlining probably is really starting to entrench itself,\" she said, Williams used them to define footprints of the residential buildings that had been lost through redlining.(Left to right) as artist Amanda Williams, her daughter and Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) listen as Mayor Lori Lightfoot reads a note of congratulations to Williams from the city of Chicago on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0As Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) joined the volunteers and planted tulips in the gardens on that brisk mid-October morning, Williams reflected on her efforts and those of the multitude of other artists and developers who currently are working in nearby South Side neighborhoods within the intersection of development, history and art. These include Emmanuel Pratt with Sweet Water Farms, Bernard Loyd with Build Bronzeville, Dorian Sylvain and Rahmaan Statik with various mural projects, Bill Hill with the Dorchester Botanical Garden, Theaster Gates with Kenwood Gardens, the Luv Institute and its Parade of Hearts, Tonika Johnson and the Folded Map Project and others.\"We'll look back and this would have been a moment,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe understand the power, it's coming from every angle, creativity.\"The tulips are expected to bloom sometime in April.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.Redlining is as strong as ever.

  "title": "Lamont Robinson, state rep. (5th), running for 4th Ward alderman",
  "text": "State Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)ReporterState Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) is running to replace Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, leaning into his experience as a two-term state legislator and work in the private sector as an insurance salesman and former adjunct business professor.\"I'm hoping to take my statewide experience to the City Council to continue to improve the safety, equity and wellbeing of my local neighbors in the 4th Ward,\" he said in an interview. \"I see that there's a void in my community by Sophia King running for mayor, and I want to be able to fill that void.\"Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's 4th Ward Democratic Organization has endorsed his candidacy.In terms of his track record in elected office, which he\u2019s held since 2018, Robinson is proudest of his advocacy to save Mercy Hospital, now called Insight Hospital and Medical Center Chicago, 2525 S. Michigan Ave. He also noted his legislation to remove lead pipes across the state with a requirement for minority-owned firms to do at least 11% of the contracts, as well as work to secure resources for public safety and to build centers for seniors, LGBTQ people and job-workforce development in his district.Robinson's district runs from River North down through the Loop, South Loop, Bronzeville and Washington Park, with a portion of South Shore. The 4th Ward runs along the lakefront from South Loop to 53rd Street in Hyde Park.If elected, Robinson would be the first openly gay Black male alderman and the second over all, after Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).Mercy Hospital\u00a0Robinson said he brought community groups, labor unions and religious organizations together to protest the planned closing of Mercy Hospital.Its former owner had reported millions of dollars in monthly losses and capital serious needs; the Insight Chicago nonprofit in turn promised to run the facility as a teaching and community hospital through at least 2029 after purchasing it for $1.\"We were out there for a year protesting, in the rain, sleet, snow,\" he said. \"I was at the forefront of that. I pulled together my neighbors; I pulled together the faith-based community; I pulled together the unions. And we kept that in the news, and there was national attention we got on that closure. And we were able to keep it open. Jobs were saved, and we don't have a health care desert in my community.\"Lead pipesRobinson's Lead Service Line Replacement and Notification Act establishes a Lead Service Line Replacement Fund administered by the Illinois Environmental Replacement Agency. It became law on Jan. 1 and requires owners and operators of community water supplies to develop an inventory of lead water service lines and implement a replacement plan. Chicago has reported 522,571 lead connections.The federal government's bipartisan infrastructure plan includes $15 billion to replace lead pipes nationwide. The Chicago Department of Water Management is accepting applications to replace lead service pipes for households with income below 80% of the area median income ($83,350 for a family of four) or for homeowner occupants, noting the high likelihood of houses and two-flats built before 1986 having lead water service lines. (More information is available at leadsafechicago.org.)Progress in Chicago has been slow, however, with WTTW reporting last month that less than half of 1% of 400,000 service lines, 154, have been replaced, though Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration said the city would remove 650 pipes by the end of last year through $15 million in federal grants.Robinson said he wants to be on City Council to spearhead efforts to replace the lines, adding that he has worked with Illinois U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth to procure federal resources.\u00a0Community centersRobinson pointed to the lack of a Chicago Senior Center in the mid-South Side and the number of seniors who live in the ward. \"I was able to secure $10 million for that effort,\" he said.\u00a0Site-selection is ongoing, as it is for the job-workforce center that is to run with the nonprofit Community Assistance Programs employment agency, 11717 S. Halsted St. He said it will be in Bronzeville and do workforce development in services and trades. It will also have a housing component akin to college dormitories, though there will be no age cap.Robinson also got funds for a to-be-built South Side LGBTQ community center, to be run with Howard Brown Health.He noted the millions of dollars in violence-prevention money he got from the state for the South Side, saying, \"That money has been out, and it has been in the hands of community-based organizations.\"\u00a0Public safety\u00a0According to Robinson, gang, drug and gambling activity is still common on 35th Street due to a lack of police engagement, namely giving out tickets and visiting local businesses. He said that is changing, though because of meetings with the area's alderwomen and Chicago Police Department leadership. Arrests and officer patrols are up.\"That's what we need to do on all the retail corridors in the 4th Ward,\" he said. \"I look forward to continuing to work with police to ensure that we have a safe community, but I think it's also important that we can close these gaps around violence when we engage the community \u2014 when we come together and make sure that we're calling 9-1-1 and reporting incidents.\"To ensure a bigger police presence would not lead to over-policing or racist incidents, Robinson highlighted the importance of community policing: having the same officers assigned to a corridor so that they can know residents and businesses.\u00a0More resources are needed. If elected, he said he would like to see greater utilization of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago's resources, especially their surveillance cameras and police forces.\"We look at Bronzeville, at 35th Street \u2014 there are local businesses there, and we need to make sure that we bring in new businesses, that folks are able to walk that retail corridor and feel safe, \" Robinson said. \"I think that that is needed because we haven't been able to see the needle move with respect to 35th Street.\"The 35th Street corridor does not have a special service area, the city's business improvement districts that use local tax revenue for beautification and to attract new developments. (SSA #61, aka Downtown Hyde Park, covers the 53rd Street corridor in coordination with the South East Chicago Commission.)\u00a0Robinson was a commissioner on SSA #47, on 43rd and 47th streets and Cottage Grove Avenue, which runs with Quad Cities Development Corporation (QCDC), 4210 S. Berkeley Ave., and claimed the 2014-opened Shops & Lofts at 47, 747 E. 47th St., as an accomplishment. Bringing in retail and affordable housing and removing blight is the goal on 35th. He also wants to advocate for the Chicago Park District to clean up its local properties after events.Robinson began his Allstate insurance agency\u00a0on 47th Street in Kenwood in 2007. (It's now at 5050 S. Indiana Ave.) He joined QCDC\u2019s board in 2009. He said he could utilize the relations he has as a state representative with large corporations in Illinois as an alderman.\u00a0He spent eight years at Kenwood Academy running the Kappa Leadership Institute mentoring program, which he said has sent hundreds of young men from Chicago high schools to college nationwide, and he taught business at Harold Washington College.Education is important to him, and he wants to work for the ward's schools from Printer's Row to Hyde Park. That means boosting neighborhood schools to attract students and projecting safety around them, which he called his ultimate responsibility.\u00a0\"As the current state rep., I have met with all of my neighborhood schools. And I look to continue doing that work as an alderman,\" he said. \"We can lean on Chicago Public Schools to give us those resources, or we can go out and get those resources ourselves.\"When King College Prep, 4445 S. Drexel Blvd., needed iPads, he connected the principal to Apple. He liaised the school leadership with the U. of C. to help it establish a health care and engineering education track.He runs his district office, 5048 S. Indiana Ave., with three dedicated staffers, including one who works on senior services, and interns from the U. of C. They phone banked seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic to gauge their needs, including food deliveries, and direct them to testing.\u00a0Should he be elected, he said he would bring his three staffers to run his ward office and work to create an app to inform constituents of goings-on in the ward and take in service requests. He said he would gain constituent feedback from coffee meetings across the ward.\u00a0\"I've been accessible as a state rep.; I'm going to be accessible as an alderman. I think that those are the things that people need to see (so they) want to stay in the 4th Ward and move into the 4th Ward,\" he said.\u00a0Robinson said he wants \"to put the community in the center of all decisions,\" including polling them to see what kind of housing and commercial developments they want. In addition to a local affordable housing shortage, he pointed to a shortage of local affordable commercial space. He would continue engaging with the advisory board associated with the development of the Michael Reese Hospital site and wants himself to get more information about the project's timeline.Working as a state legislator and liaising with various state departments would benefit his work as an alderman, particularly in terms of getting potholes filled. Being able to get the state to clean up the Dan Ryan Expressway would be similar to fostering clean-up efforts on King Drive or Cottage Grove.He said his personal background enables him to understand how marginalized people feel voiceless and the need to advocate for them in government. He nearly lost his business during the Great Recession and seeing it endure today is a testament to his work ethic and will to do whatever it takes to be successful \u2014 qualities he brings to his legislative work and would bring to the job as alderman.Robinson grew up in Chatham, the son of a public schoolteacher and a building inspector who died when he was 17. He attended Mount Carmel High School, Clark Atlanta University and National Louis University, where he earned a master's degree in business administration.He has a partner of 13 years who also sells insurance. Should he be elected, Robinson said his partner would continue running the business and that he would still work there, saying that the arrangement has not led to conflicts of interest in Springfield.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "King promises new CPD leadership, more officers if elected mayor",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King's (4th) newly released public safety platform calls for firing incumbent police Superintendent David Brown and hiring hundreds of retired officers and detectives to, respectively, do non-dangerous duties and improve the city's crime clearance rate.She would also turn back many of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's law enforcement initiatives, namely her establishment of citywide task force units, and return the 875 officers involved to full-time neighborhood patrols.King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0That proposal is similar to recent state action, including an Illinois Office of Firearm Violence Prevention that coordinates with and funds anti-violence community organizations. King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0While some studies question the effectiveness of violence interrupters at preventing community violence, King said funding violence intervention programs \"at scale\" would be more preventative.Similar to the state's creation of a mental health first-responder system in coordination with the federal government's new 9-8-8 number that connects to suicide and crisis hotlines, King also calls for expanding responses to substance abuse-, mental health- and extreme poverty-related 9-1-1 calls that would provide non-law enforcement responses to nonviolent situations. (The city, meanwhile, began programs piloting mental health responses to emergency calls last year.)As more surveillance cameras have been installed throughout Hyde Park in response to a spate of violent crime last year, King proposes to do the same citywide, claiming that they and drones would be useful when physical pursuits or investigations could be dangerous to law enforcement or civilians.King also wants officer body cameras to automatically start recording upon officers unholstering their firearms.\"Why don't we have that technology?\" she asked in an interview. \"When officers are in a situation, one of the last things they're probably thinking is, 'Oh, I've got to turn my body-worn camera on.' They shouldn't be thinking about that; they should be thinking about community safety.\"She said she has been in conversation with violence prevention organizations and current and retired officers, including three past superintendents, though she declined to name them.King said not even $5 million of the $85 million set aside for violence prevention in last year's city budget has been spent; she proposes spending $200 million more on violence prevention over the next two years.\"We're in a unique situation where we've got millions of dollars of federal funds that will run out in a few years,\" she said, recalling the money the city got through the 2021-passed American Rescue Plan Act enacted to counter the financial, health-related and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We should use that money wisely, put a dent in the real problems and scale up these programs.\"King proposes enacting all changes mandated by the Chicago Police Department's consent decree, enacted because of the police murder of Laquan McDonald, by 2027. In March, the department and the Illinois attorney general extended the deadline for reforms to 2030 instead of 2027.Fundamentally, \"We need to start distributing police more equitably, but we also need more police,\" King said, hence her proposal for recruiting 1,000 retired officers into a \"Chicago Reserve\" to work at festivals and the academy and on case management and desk duty. Adding more than 200 detectives could be done, she said, by internal promotions and hiring back retired detectives.That said, CPD is facing ongoing difficulties in filling its extant open positions and issues with burnout among officers. King said many retired officers are doing security work and wondered why they would not return to the force to do similar work \"for a city that's in peril.\"Her plan also proposes adopting $10,000 in home down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers on CPD and a $5,000 hiring bonus. She also proposes compressing the officers' workweek into one where they work two 10-hour shifts over four days, which would give them multiple three days off in a row every week instead of canceled time off and six days of work on end.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Review: 'Punch 9' offers sweeping look at Harold Washington's life and legacy",
  "text": "EditorEditor's note: This review was originally published on October\u00a022, 2021.\u00a0At the beginning of \u201cPunch 9 for Harold Washington,\u201d a television interviewer asks the former mayor what he would like a future historian to write about his administration.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019d probably say, \u2018That was a turning point \u2014 that was a turning point,\u2019 \u201d Washington responds.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPunch 9,\u201d a new documentary covering Harold Washington\u2019s time as mayor from 1983 to 1987, takes this idea seriously, examining a brief and near-revolutionary interlude in Chicago with an eye sharply attuned to its historic nature \u2014 both the awareness of the people living through it that they were making history and their reflections, 30-plus years after the fact, on the hard-fought triumph and melancholy aftermath of Washington\u2019s short reign.\u00a0Harold Washington and the documentary\u2019s director, Joe Winston, both have deep connections to Hyde Park: The mayor lived in the neighborhood during his time in office, while Winston grew up here and attended Kenwood Academy. Winston\u2019s previous work includes a documentary adaptation of \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?\u201d, the 2004 best-seller by Thomas Frank \u2014 another former Hyde Parker \u2014 examining the groundswell of populist conservatism in the American heartland.(Locally, or at least in the Herald\u2019s offices, Winston is best-loved for \u201cThis Week in Joe\u2019s Basement,\u201d his public access television show that ran in the late 80s and early 90s out of his parents\u2019 house.)\u00a0Political journalism is not new territory for Winston, then, and \u201cPunch 9\u201d \u2014 available to screen virtually at the Chicago International Film Festival through this weekend \u2014 deftly sets up its stakes at the beginning. Into the mid-'70s, Chicago is governed by Mayor Richard J. Daley, who presides over a vast and tentacular patronage system that privileges white ethnics and neglects Black neighborhoods. \u201cThe trains ran on time, but the schools were still segregated,\u201d runs one commentator's description.\u00a0Daley\u2019s sudden death in 1976 creates a power vacuum. Fellow Bridgeporter Michael Bilandic takes over, but not after a turbulent interlude during which Ald. Wilson Frost, the Black president pro tem of City Council, tries to declare himself acting mayor. Washington, then an Illinois state senator, observes that Frost would have become mayor if he were white.\u00a0During the terms of the next two mayors \u2014 the hapless Bilandic, undone by a 40-hour blizzard, and Jane Byrne, depicted in the movie as someone who betrayed the Black voters who delivered her into office \u2014 Black activists and politicians begin looking around for someone to run for the office. They settle on Washington, who had attempted an unsuccessful primary campaign against Bilandic in 1977 and was elected to the U.S. House in 1980. Reluctant to give up his D.C. sinecure, he asks for 50,000 new registered voters; with the help of Black activists like Timuel Black, who passed away on Oct. 13, 2021, that number is easily surpassed. (In a moment the film, to its credit, doesn't play up, Washington also says of the mayoral post that \u201cit might kill you but, boy, you\u2019d sure look good sitting in the saddle.\u201d)\u00a0The archival footage of Washington on the campaign trail and in press conferences makes for the film\u2019s most compelling moments. It\u2019s like bearing witness to a force of nature \u2014 not just for the power of his easy charisma and eloquence, but for how inevitable he makes his own ascent appear. He mocks Byrne charmingly during a primary debate; he\u2019s seen kidding around with a young boy at a campaign rally. \u201cReporters have to carry around their dictionaries to figure out what he\u2019s saying,\u201d recalls Hyde Parker Jacky Grimshaw, just before we see Washington call federal housing codes \u201cantediluvian.\u201dThe documentary is crafted almost wholly out of archival footage and contemporaneous interviews with notables like David Axelrod, Jesse Jackson and Valerie Jarrett. It makes for an immersive experience \u2014 watching grainy news reels, I felt lifted back in time to a city both familiar and a little strange, with its older cars, frumpier fashions and more overt racism.\u00a0When I spoke with Winston in 2019 while he was fundraising for the documentary, he said that he was worried that Chicagoans were beginning to forget some of the realities of Washington\u2019s time. \u201cHarold Washington, if we do nothing, is in danger of becoming just sort of an icon, a Santa Claus,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a simplified figure that people can evoke when it\u2019s convenient, without taking into account who he was or what he did.\u201dTaking its cue from this concern, \u201cPunch 9\u201d focuses much of its attention on the harsh realities of racial politics, and the implacable opposition of white politicians and residents to Washington\u2019s campaign and subsequent mayoralty. Bernard Epton, Washington\u2019s Republican opponent in the 1983 general election and a state representative from Hyde Park, used the campaign slogan \u201cEpton for Mayor...before it\u2019s too late\u201d \u2014 hardly a subtle nudge to white ethnic enclaves in the city. (One of the film\u2019s most interesting interviews comes with Epton\u2019s guilt-ridden, lachrymal son, who compares his father\u2019s campaigns events to Nazi rallies at Nuremberg.)\u00a0Even after Washington\u2019s narrow victory over Epton, his time in office is difficult, to put it mildly. He is obstructed at every turn in City Council by a bloc of 29 aldermen, all but one of them white, led by Eddie Vrdolyak and Ed Burke.Vrdolyak, on the night of the election, had reportedly told the precinct captains under his command that \u201cIt\u2019s a racial thing \u2026 don\u2019t kid yourself. I\u2019m calling on you to save your city \u2026 We\u2019re fighting to keep the city the way it is.\u201d While neither he nor Burke were interviewed for the film, the assurances from then-allies like Dick Mell that the issue was more about power than race ring hollow.\u00a0Washington is able to work around this deadlock at times, implementing the anti\u2013machine Shakman decrees and instituting affirmative action in city hiring. (The reality of Washington\u2019s relationship to the patronage system is perhaps a little more complicated than we\u2019re led to believe, as the political scientist Anne Freedman showed in a paper written shortly after his death.) He is also able to move funding toward a more equitable, neighborhood-first model.\u00a0City Council does eventually flip in his favor and he wins a second term, but Washington never really gets a chance to enact his full agenda: On Nov. 25, 1987, he slumps over at his desk during a discussion with his press secretary; he is pronounced dead of a heart attack that afternoon. \u201cPunch 9\u201d shows us the scenes from a prayer vigil downtown, where hundreds of people gather and begin to grieve after the news of his death is announced.\u00a0Part of the tragedy of Washington\u2019s untimely passing, the documentary suggests, is what came after \u2014 an unraveling of anti-patronage measures and the re-marginalization of the South and West sides, as Richard M. Daley assumed the city\u2019s mayorship in 1989 and proceeded to hold it for a record-setting 22 years. It is difficult to reconcile any of this with the determination and joy of the ascent; watching it, a gloom begins to set in.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the film, we are shown present-day footage of Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police protestors from the last several years, alongside an excerpt of Lori Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 victory speech on the night she became the third Black mayor of Chicago: \u201cOne day, you will stand on my shoulders, as I stand on the shoulders of so many...the shoulders of political giants, like the late, great Harold Washington.\"This is a strange juxtaposition \u2014 are these meant to represent two hopeful aspects of Washington\u2019s legacy? If so, we should admit that they are in tension; many of the participants in the recent social movements are deeply suspicious of electoral politics, and Lightfoot herself criticized protesters on multiple occasions last summer. But the film seems reluctant to acknowledge this, and the coda feels more like a half-hearted stab at hopefulness than a reflection on our continuities and breaks with the past.\u00a0If we return to Washington\u2019s words at the beginning of the film \u2014 that his administration represented a \u201cturning point\u201d \u2014 we might take them as a fact, and search our present, often in vain, for the progress he promised. But we might also hear them as a wish, unfulfilled through no fault of Washington's own. Then the film becomes something deeper and sadder, an archival examination of a city swept up in a movement that promised radical change, and watched with the knowledge that much of that change failed to materialize. By showing us history in vivid detail, \u201cPunch 9\u201d inhabits the spirit of a time whose promise still haunts us.\u00a0\u201cPunch 9 for Harold Washington\u201d is showing at select AMC theaters in Chicago through Oct. 14. Visit punch9movie.com\u00a0for more information and showtimes.\u201cPunch 9\u201d focuses much of its attention on the harsh realities of racial politics, and the implacable opposition of white politicians and residents to Washington\u2019s campaign and subsequent mayoralty.EditorChristian Belanger graduated from the University of Chicago in 2017.

  "text": "Tina HoneReporterTina HoneMartina Hone, chief engagement officer for the City of Chicago since 2020, has stepped down from her role to run for 5th Ward alderwoman. An attorney who has spent decades working on Capitol Hill and in City Hall, Hone joins a crowded field of candidates to replace outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston.She was born in Hyde Park to a white father and a Black mother who met on the former 57th Street bridge between the beach and the Museum of Science and Industry. Her father once noted that she can walk into a room without people making racialized judgments about her and that her experience is different from most other Black people\u2019s.\u00a0\"I don't want to diminish and disrespect the very real challenges that people who are much more visibly African American face, including the people in my family like my sister and my mom. They face the real discrimination of being followed around the store. My nephew was stopped for 'driving while Black,'\" Hone said. \"It's a very real experience that is not part of my experience, but vicariously and very painfully, seeing what's happened to my family and to other people I love.\"She recalled how mean the landlord of their building at 54th Street and Dorchester Avenue was to her single mother after her parents' divorce before their move to Chatham and then Roseland.Hone said seeing the disparities between her father's white experience on the North Side and her mother's Black experience on the South Side, \"That whipsaw, that very visible seeing it, experiencing and feeling it is what made me such a fierce social justice warrior.\"\u00a0She eventually moved back to Hyde Park for college at the University of Chicago before moving west for law school at the University of California, Berkeley. After a few years working at law firms, she taught middle school in the Bay Area through Teach for America, which in the early 1990s was a new organization.She moved to Washington, D.C. after that, hoping to work in education policy but wound up taking jobs in the House Judiciary Committee (with a focus on immigration policy), the Commerce Department (specifically the 2000 census) and the American Legacy Foundation, an anti-tobacco use organization. In total, Hone spent more than 20 years working at the Capitol.Hone moved back to Hyde Park six years ago after her first husband died; she worked at YWCA Metropolitan Chicago for three years, ending as chief equity officer. In September 2020, she began work as Mayor Lori Lightfoot's chief engagement officer; she did not work on her 2019 mayoral campaign.In mid-September she left Lightfoot\u2019s administration to launch her aldermanic bid. As a four-year member of the Fairfax County School Board in Northern Virginia, she is the only declared candidate thus far who has experience holding an elected office.She said her experience in Congress matters as much as her experience in local government. \"All of the roles matter, because what you come to understand is it's easy to grandstand, make empty promises and say what you're going to do, but the actual task of getting things done is far more complicated and far more nuanced,\" she said.Hone was the only Black person on a school board for an affluent district in which Black and brown students made up a third of enrollment. She created an organization, Coalition of The Silence, composed of parents of color and parents of students with disabilities to advocate for their children's needs. Hone said they got third grade reading levels measured as a marker of student progress as well as kindergarten readiness considered and discriminatory discipline policies changed. She also got more people of color elected to the school board.\u00a0\"Understanding how to work in coalition and understanding how to listen to all views\" comes in handy, Hone said, in the \"incredibly complex\" 5th Ward. She noted that it contains five community areas: Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn, South Shore and Greater Grand Crossing. \"To be able to represent every part of this ward, one really has to be open enough to hearing a diversity of views,\" she said.\u00a0To do that, Hone said she would create a community council made up of representatives of all community areas and not solely comprised, she said, of \"the usual suspects.\" Not that she has anything against them (\"They become the usual suspects because they do something\"), but because there are important, smart and thoughtful people who are nevertheless apolitical and therefore are not getting their views expressed in public discourse.\"I actually would spend the time, as I did as chief engagement officer, trying to find the people who may not traditionally be at tables and give them space at the table,\" she said.\u00a0Echoing other declared candidates, Hone said public safety is a top concern of 5th Ward voters she's spoken to, adding that it\u2019s not a problem she believes can be solved with increased policing.Better policing, like shorter response times, is needed \u2014 she noted staffing shortages in the Chicago Police Department and suggested different assignments or restructuring \u2014 but she said that law enforcement will not be the thing that makes Chicago safe. She noted generational trauma's role in crime and the \"enduring results of economic disenfranchisement in the Black community.\u201d She noted the importance of entrepreneurship programs and others to help developers and contractors to counteract this, but she also wants a \"meaningful\" job program.\u00a0\"There are vacancies in the city of Chicago that could be prioritized for not the Black community, but communities that have been experiencing the most chronic levels of unemployment and the lowest levels of income,\" she said. \"Not surprisingly, those end up being predominantly Black communities.\"\"One of the hardest parts of governing is that you are generally dealing with competing legitimate interests,\" she said, recalling the town hall meetings she ran on the city's planned casino to be built in River West that has upset nearby residents. Hone said community input is an important part of the decision-making process but not dispositive.While Hone is an alumna of Lightfoot's administration, she emphasized that she is running as Tina Hone. \"Among the reasons it was incredibly important for me to step down is because I wanted to be sure that the people of the 5th Ward understood that I am not here as anyone's puppet,\" she said.She nevertheless said she has a good relationship with Lightfoot, who is running for reelection, and said of the mayor: \u201cI wish people understood her better\u2026 Like all people, she loses her temper. But in my experience, it was as constructive a work environment as I\u2019ve ever worked in.\u201d\u00a0This contrasts with the working relationship many alderpersons say they have with Lightfoot. Ald. Sophia King (4th) has been motivated to challenge Lightfoot for her job based in part by how bad she said relations are with City Council and how low in esteem alderpersons are held as partners in governing the city.Regardless of who wins the mayoral election, Hone noted the huge number of vacancies coming to City Council, calling the incoming number of freshmen alderpersons \"a fresh start.\"\"I think it's a great opportunity to have a restart button where City Council members can have a more active role in not just representing their wards but being partners in the governing of the city,\" Hone said.\u00a0In terms of local development, Hone said she is a supporter of the Obama Presidential Center, but hopes the engagement process going forward \"is broader than just the communities just directly around the Obama Center,\" noting the effect the closure of Cornell Drive will have on Far South Side communities like Roseland.\u00a0Hone believes the OPC will lead to the revitalization and redevelopment of South Shore, and she wants to ensure that any benefits that come are equitably shared. \"It's important that we put development dollars into neighborhoods that have been completely disinvested in,\" she said. \"71st Street should be as vibrant as 53rd Street.\"Many South Shore residents and community organizations, such as Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) \u2013 a member of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition \u2013 however, have repeatedly raised concerns that the \u201credevelopment\u201d of the neighborhood could lead to widespread displacement as housing costs rise. Calls for the development of more affordable housing in the neighborhood \u2013 such as what was guaranteed in the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance \u2013 and stronger protections for renters have largely been ignored by the City.When asked about maintaining affordability in Hyde Park, Hone said homeowners should be able to take advantage of increasing property values without the risk of losing their homes. She said that large rental companies like Mac Properties and Pangea Properties operate like monopolies, decrying the declining number of mom-and-pop resident landlords and calling it \"a much more important piece of the affordable housing puzzle\u201d than most people recognize.\"When you're in the neighborhood and it's your building, you're going to take care of that building in a different way than being an absentee investor who just bought up a lot of six-flats,\" she said. \"We need to figure out how to make mega-developers accountable for the things that they're doing and are able to do in terms of increasing rents subtly.\"Incentivizing landlords to buy and operate locally and at a small scale through financing is something the council should investigate, she said.Hone said her experience in government would give her a leg up in handling constituent services, particularly in the Byzantine city bureaucracy. Not only does she know who to call, but she said she has existing relationships with people in local departments and agencies. She said she would like to open a service office in a central location in the ward.And she said she would be a steady advocate for Promontory Point, which holds personal significance to her as a native Hyde Parker. \"I really, really believe there is a way to preserve the point with the limestone and beauty that it is. And it'll be a priority to me,\" she said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.Mayoral candidate Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner unveils plan for Chicago Public Schools outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "text": "Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th)ReporterAld. Jeanette Taylor (20th)City Council will see tremendous changeover next year, with the likelihood of some incumbents losing reelection and the large number of alderpersons retiring.\u00a0But one of the body's great firebrands, first-term Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), of Woodlawn, wants another four years, saying she has listened to her community and delivered for it after decades of wayward political leadership.\"I've been a woman of my word. I've stood up for my community; I've stood with my community,\" Taylor said in an interview. \"I still have a lot of work to do. You can't change culture and community in four years, but I feel like the community is moving in the right direction.\"She said she has turned power back to the community over her three-plus years in office, specifically gaining constituent input in decisions around development and other ward business.\"There's a community development team. Those are 15 people who I didn't know before I got into office, and they look into development with me,\" Taylor said. \"So I don't meet with developers one-on-one; I meet with them with the team, and they actually reach out to the community, to get them to have two community meetings and decide whether they want the development to be in the ward or not.\"Development team members volunteer their time; Taylor said they live across the ward and meet two or three times a month. Developments haven't been turned down per se; the team gives feedback and asks developers to revise plans.\u00a0They asked DL3 Realty and Michaels Development, for instance, to include more family units in the $30.8 million Park Station development to be built at 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue. Forty one of those units will be affordable; Park Station is the first to be built under the terms of the Woodlawn Affordable Housing Ordinance Taylor and Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) passed with Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2020.She also said she is ensuring that developers do construction work considerately: \"You've got to keep it clean, or you're getting a ticket. You've got to start after 8 o'clock, or you're getting a ticket.\"\"We have plenty of business developers who come to our ward who want to develop. It's about them being able to get up in the community,\" she said. \"One of the things I hear clearly when I knock doors is 'I'm tired of coming home and there's a new business or development that I knew nothing about.' So (I make) sure that I inform the community and they're at the table when we're talking about this. And that takes longer, because the developers have to knock doors, and we have to make time for people to participate and have community meetings.\"Taylor, who has made a habit of giving her personal cell phone number out to anyone who wants it, said she is at her office, 5707 S. Wentworth Ave., for open meetings from noon to 7:30 p.m. on Thursdays. She also hosts a monthly ward night.\u00a0She said her ward office has made a practice of following up on 3-1-1 city services requests constituents tell them about. \"You call this office, we make sure we follow up,\" she said. \"It's not a thing of you saying, 'Hey, there's a hole in the street.' I'm asking you to send me that service request number so that we can follow up. And we follow up with the community to make sure those things happen.\"\"I have a personal relationship with the people in the ward,\" she said. \"When they feel that their needs aren't met, that's a conversation they can have.\"Taylor called public safety one of the ward's most-pressing concerns, adding that she wanted to see constituents take more responsibility for the issue and not pass all problems on to the police. She said she has highlighted organizations focusing on violence-prevention, education and youth development to ensure constituents know about their services, specifically touting newer ones like the Woodlawn Restorative Justice Hub, 602 E. 61st St., or LaTanya & The Youth of Englewood, 3135 W. 63rd St., on top of more established ones.\u00a0In terms of quality of life, Taylor said \"the ruckus and mess\" on 63rd Street's intersections with Cottage Grove Avenue and King Drive, spots that have had issues with drug-dealing, shootings and loitering, have declined as she has engaged with the state Department of Children and Family Services, community organizations and local churches.Absent the drug-users getting sober \u2014 which remains a goal \u2014 Taylor said she would like to have a community conversation about opening some kind of location where people could go off the street, like a small park.\u00a0She said public safety conversations with constituents reflect that the solution often lies in community efforts and investment, as opposed to more policing.\u00a0\"I've been willing to work with the community, CPD and the community organizations to say, 'How can we work together to create change and get people what they need?'\" Taylor said. \"We've done it. We don't want to be 53rd; we want to be 63rd. People forget what 63rd used to be like. 63rd used to be a place you could shop and get anything that you needed right in our own community, and that's what we want to go back to. But better yet, we want to own the institutions, and we want institutions that look like us in our own community.\"Politically, Taylor is not Lightfoot's ally on City Council: The alderwoman has voted against the mayor's budgets, and the two made headlines for their heated June 2021 discussion on the council floor over the terms of the city's settlement with Anjanette Young, the social worker who was victimized by CPD during a mistaken raid of her home in 2019.\"I can agree to disagree with her, but that doesn't mean I don't have to work the floor,\" Taylor said, adding that the two have a working relationship: \"We are two Black women in a space where there's not a respect for Black women anyway, and so what will my community gain by fighting with her? Absolutely nothing.\"Taylor said she has learned to trust people more in order to turn the gears of government \u2014 both her colleagues and workers in the city's bureaucracy. But \u2014 no surprise, coming from someone who cut her teeth in community activism \u2014 she said \"the squeaky wheel gets the oil\" in regards to delivering municipal services.\"After my first budget meeting, when I went off on a lot of these departments and I told them I'm not a person you can't talk to. I'm not a person who's not willing to work with you; I just want to make sure those services get done. I really don't have any problems,\" she said.The once-a-decade ward redistricting process was chaotic, however. Taylor's constituency, the 20th Ward, will geographically change. Traditionally Woodlawn's ward, it still contains most of that neighborhood after the council's post-census remapping, alongside the southern half of Washington Park and portions of Englewood and Back of the Yards.\u00a0The Black Caucus fought tooth and nail to preserve a large number of majority-African American wards in the city, hence ward boundaries' tortured lines slicing up communities and neighborhoods across the South and West sides. Beginning next year, the 20th Ward will also contain a small section of northwestern Hyde Park.Taylor, facing reelection, is running on her record, saying, \"For people who are saying ain't nothing changed in four years, I doubt that very seriously. Because what relationship did you have with the previous alderman?\"Taylor's two immediate predecessors are convicted felons; the one before them died, and his predecessor was also indicted. Taylor, for her part, wants two more terms.\"We need to have hard conversations about our young people and violence that goes on in our community, but we also need to be realistic about what to do with it. I feel like I bring transparency to the table, and I want to have those hard conversations. And while I don't have all the answers, I expect the community to help me come up with those answers. Because we have some pretty smart people in the ward, some people who've done this, some people who will help us not repeat some of the history that's happened in the community.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Blackstone Ave.Construction on the \"Kenwood Link,\" Kenwood Academy's $8.3 million elevated, enclosed pedway connecting the main building with the former Canter Middle School is set to begin in early 2023.On Sept. 13, the Public Buildings Commission voted to approve the project's final budget \u2014 up from last year's estimates of $7.5 million \u2014 and proceed with construction.According to a representative of the commission, is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\u00a0The process to get the pedway build has stretched for years. As it stands, students have to leave one building to go to the other, braving the elements. The pedway will span the parking lot between the two buildings, linking them.\"It's been a longstanding desire of the principal of that campus to make sure that those buildings are linked so that there can be free flow between administrator staff and students,\" said Mayor Lori Lightfoot during the commission meeting.In previous Herald reporting, Calloway has said the pedway is dual-purpose: Shielding students and staff from the elements and improving campus safety.Though Ald. Sophia King (4th) initially proposed paying for the project through dollars raised by the 53rd Street Tax Increment Financing, or TIF, district, funding will instead come from the Chicago Public Schools' 2022 Capital Budget.Funding for CPS' 2022 Capital budget, which totals $706.6 million of investments to neighborhood schools across the city, comes primarily from future issuance of general obligation bonds, which are principally repaid by the district's Evidence-Based Funding (EBF) model.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.I remain flummoxed at the cost of this steel and glass breezeway between buildings.

Leslie Hairston (5th): Adrienne Irmer, a public policy administrator and commissioner for Special Services Area #42, which oversees economic development in South Shore.Irmer announced her candidacy on Tuesday, September 13 with an early endorsement from former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun and an eagerness to explain how her professional and civic background would prepare her well for public service on City Council.Raised in Hyde Park, Irmer now lives in and is raising children in South Shore. \"I have service in my heart and in my blood. I was raised to be a community-first person,\" she said. \"I think it's a great opportunity to give back to these two communities that made me who I am.\" Irmer is also the daughter of Perri Irmer, president and CEO of the\u00a0DuSable Museum of African American History, 740 E. 56th Pl.Irmer said she would be \"a very strong steward for the ward\" from the first day on the job, pointing to her current role as assistant vice president of external affairs at the Illinois Institute of Technology and past constituent service work for former state Sen. Kwame Raoul (D-13th).From her professional experience, Irmer said she said she would be able to build relationships and coalitions to get services for the ward and win council votes. She said she knows how municipal government works in collaboration with state and federal governments. (In her role at Illinois Institute of Technology, she's lobbied with other universities for the state to increase the amount of money in the Monetary Award Program (MAP) grants given to income-eligible Illinois students.) And she said she is familiar with the city's bureaucracy.In 2020, Irmer was also appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot as commissioner for Special Service Area #42 (71st Street and Stony Island Avenue), where she has been involved in investing money for things like beautification, litter abatement and surveillance cameras in concert with the Department of Planning and Development.\u00a0If elected, Irmer said an early priority would be to set about streamlining ward services like tree-trimming, snow-removal and road-repair.\u00a0\"There's a process at the city that bottlenecks, and it bottlenecks around 3-1-1,\" she said. \"What I would like to do is make it part of the staff's job to batch all of the 3-1-1 requests every week and figure out where the requests are coming in so that if we get a tree-trimmer, we can deploy them all at once to the same area instead of having to double-back to the same area.\"She would like to effect a city-wide program through ordinance, \"to development a system that's actually streamlined at the process level at the city, so that they're also doing that as opposed to us as alderpeople also having to streamline their request process.\"\u00a0\"Every alderperson has to provide these services to their constituents. It would be in their best interest to figure out a way that we could streamline the process at the city level, because then we all get the service that we need and people don't get trees interfering with their power lines and potholes sitting open for months and seasons on end.\"In terms of public safety, Irmer is interested in the city's pilot Corridor Ambassador program, in which community organizations like Bright Star Community Outreach, 333 E. 35th St., provide trauma counseling, anti-violence intervention training and workforce development programs.\u00a0\"That's a solution that doesn't cost a billion dollars but is actually really effective at putting community members in front of community members to connect them with resources that they need, whether it's workforce development, housing or childcare. I think that would go a long way towards making communities safer without necessarily relying on very expensive policing,\" Irmer said.In terms of housing, Irmer said she would like to see developers put in more affordable units in transit-oriented developments, the city-incentivized mixed-use developments within a short walking distance of public transit.\u00a0In line with her role at SSA #42, Irmer said she would like to \"take a hard look\" at the city's vacant property tax relief program to promote business development in South Shore.The county assessor allows owners to apply for tax relief for two years if they are making \"good faith efforts\" to lease the property. Block Club has reported that three in five storefronts on 75th Street in South Shore were empty in 2020 and that nearly half on 79th Street were as well. Irmer said the city needs to assess with the assessor and other stakeholders how long commercial property owners have been taking advantage of a tax break that incentivizes keeping their properties vacant.Additionally, she wants to examine how to get banks to finance business owners who want to open on 71st Street and other commercial corridors like it. \"As I'm knocking doors, I'm hearing wonderful business ideas, and I'm also hearing from folks that it's difficult to get the funding,\" she said.\u00a0If elected, Irmer said her ward office would employ a staffer working on business, economic and community development to liaise between city departments, chambers of commerce and organizations like the Urban League to bring resources to would-be entrepreneurs.\"I have a vision of an office with very, very talented people who are hungry to bring resources to the 5th Ward and will work collaboratively, innovatively and help get the work done with me,\" she said.Asked about Hyde Park, Irmer said she would like to use the aldermanic office to bring together decision-makers like the University of Chicago with community members to discuss what kind of businesses are wanted in commercial properties the university owns. She noted the U. of C.'s nonprofit and business incubators and suggested work be done to encourage participants in those programs to open locally.This is Irmer's second campaign for public office, after coming in fourth place in the 2018 primary election to succeed longtime Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie (D-25th) in the Illinois House. This time, Irmer said she is paying better attention to campaign data and has hired more experienced staff.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) announced her mayoral run, only one candidate has stepped up to run for the ward\u2019s soon to be vacant City Council seat.\u00a0Attorney Ebony Lucas began collecting petition signatures on Tuesday, August 30.Last Friday, August 26, Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) announced that she would retire at the end of this term\u2014her sixth. The seat is now vacant for the first time in 24 years and already has two contenders: journalist and community organizer Gabriel Piemonte, and former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode. Last week, Hairston told the Herald that she\u2019s unsure about whether or not to endorse a successor, though she\u2019s currently talking to announced and potential candidates.\u00a0Nearby, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) has committed to running for a fifth term, and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) has yet to announce a decision. So far, both seats remain without a challenger.Municipal elections will take place in February 2023, with runoff elections the following April.\u00a0King\u2014a two-term alderwoman first elected in 2016\u2014and Hairston join the City Council exodus that includes 10 other alderpersons who either are resigning, retiring or running for office.\u00a0The other two sitting alderpersons running for mayor against incumbent Lori Lightfoot are Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this story reported that no candidates had announced campaigns for 4th Ward alderperson.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "title": "Gabriel Piemonte, who ran for alderman in \u201819, declares candidacy for open seat 5th Ward race",
  "text": "Gabriel PiemonteReporterGabriel PiemonteGabriel Piemonte, a Woodlawn resident, writing coach and communications consultant who used to edit the Herald, is running for alderman of the 5th Ward again after coming in third in its 2019 contest.\u00a0\"At this moment, I feel like you've got to pour everything into this, and that's what I'm going to do,\" Piemonte said in an interview. \"It's an opportunity for the 5th Ward to reenter the fold of progressive Chicago politics and not just be kind of resting on its laurels.\"His platform had yet to be announced as of press time, but Piemonte outlined a left-of-center plan of action similar to that which he ran on last time.\u00a0Some problems remain the same; Piemonte said the 5th Ward lacks good service response infrastructure. He said he would invest in a system that allows constituents and the ward office more trackage of complaints, saying, \"If you're not getting cleanup or a pothole's not getting filled, you should know exactly why and who you can call and complain about it to.\" He said there is also room for City Council to act to ensure the city's infrastructure and bureaucracy better responds to city service needs.But the world of 2023 promises in many other ways to be worse than the world of 2019.He said Chicago Public Schools\u00a0 is \"absolutely in crisis,\" noting the teacher shortage, public policy he said does not value teachers' work and the impasse between Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration and the Chicago Teachers Union.\u00a0City Council has limited purview over education policy: the mayor appoints members of the Chicago Board of Education for the time being, though an elected school board is on the way by 2024. But Piemonte said a council speaking \"with one voice\" about Lightfoot's control of public schools, which he called \"a disaster,\" could shift the dynamic of limited legislative oversight, particularly if more progressive alderpersons are elected.The nature of crime has also changed. When Hyde Parkers used to tell him they were worried about crime, he would tell them that the neighborhood was safer than many other places and that public safety would not necessarily be a priority for that part of the ward.\"I wouldn't say that anymore,\" he said. \"I think it's reached a level of universal concern.\"\"What's going to probably peg me differently than a lot of these other candidates is we've tried more money to cops literally forever, and it doesn't yield results,\" he said. \"What does yield results, and it's almost a direct causal relationship, is economics and crime. I think you do what you can do around technology and other 'smart solutions' to increase safety, but you've got to invest economically.\"Piemonte supports a jobs guarantee, in which every Chicagoan who wants a job would get one. He wants reparations in Chicago for descendants of enslaved people, saying that\u00a0 although the city can't pay off the country's debt, it can be part of the \"patchwork of things that can be done.\"He said the University of Chicago and the Obama Foundation require cooperation from the 5th Ward alderperson.\"The Obama (Presidential) Center's not finished,\" Piemonte said. \"There's a lot of work to do, and how that gets done is going to really impart how well we work together.\"He said there is \"clear dissatisfaction\" with how it's being built, noting the passage of an advisory referendum in three 5th Ward precincts during the June primary election intended to curb cutting down more of Jackson Park\u2019s trees.\"There are consequences to having that kind of negative reception by local residents, and a lot of it can be ameliorated if there's just engagement,\" Piemonte said.For its part, the Obama Foundation held multiple community engagement meetings in the years ahead of the center\u2019s groundbreaking this past September.\u00a0Piemonte did praise the significant local hiring that has been done to build the OPC, adding that more work should be done to ensure there is continuing work after the center is built. He noted\u00a0 that the community should \u201cget some parkland back to make up for that land stolen. Closing a street isn\u2019t going to do that;\u201d referencing the roadway overhaul in Jackson Park.If elected, Piemonte said he would work to build up the ward\u2019s community institutions. As one example, he promised to bring a South Side Community Federal Credit Union, 5401 S. Wentworth Ave., to the 5th Ward.\"What matters is the jobs, and you've got to maximize the benefit of having those jobs. And that requires a kind of constellation of resources that are anchored in a financial institution,\" he said. \"I will do everything to make sure that happens, because we need a community institution with a proven track record of actually improving people's circumstances \u2014 not just engaging with them in that coldly transactional way that makes us all hate banks.\"Piemonte attributed a dearth of affordable housing options for families in the 5th Ward to rising rents and property costs related to the OPC. He said South Shore needs the same protections Woodlawn got in its Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance that Hairston, Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) hammered out in 2020.Notably, South Shore was cut out of this ordinance, and Piemonte said it should now be expanded, because \"We need a bold vision that really puts money down for everybody, not just a fraction, not just a pilot program, but commiserate investment. When we give big people money, we need little people to get money, too.\u201d\u00a0\"I don't believe it when any Chicago politician says they just don't have the power to make change. You're choosing not to,\" he said. \"The 5th Ward is one of the most powerful wards in the city at this point, with the Obama Center getting built, with the conversation about the Tiger Woods (golf course in Jackson Park) happening, with how people are thinking about the south lakefront \u2014 everybody is going to want the alderman of the 5th Ward to be playing ball with them.\"In terms of his candidacy, Piemonte conceded that his 2019 campaign had a weak ground game; he missed the runoff by a margin of 259 votes out of 12,953 cast. And he noted the profound vacuum that Hairston's retirement created in next year's 5th Ward race.\"There is, of course, the money you have as a sitting candidate and a friend to the head of the Cook County Democrats,\" he said, referring to Hairston's relationship with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. (In addition to serving on City Council together for more than a decade, the two are Democratic committeewomen for the 4th and 5th wards.)\u00a0Hairston's departure also allows Chicago's powerful unions cover to back a non-incumbent candidate; Piemonte thinks resources, period, from money to volunteers to organizational capacity, will be more plentiful next year than in 2019.Piemonte called former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode, who began running in the 5th Ward aldermanic election in July, \"an outstanding individual.\" He anticipates more candidates to declare now that the incumbent has announced her retirement.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.staff writerA group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.Buoys have appeared along the northern side of Promontory Point for the first time in two years.\u00a0Point swimmer Kelly Friedl said their group was so happy to find them there about two weeks ago. A majority of swimmers at the Point use their own personal buoys as well, but the buoys still serve to mark an area into which boats and other watercrafts should not enter.\u00a0Irene Tostado, Deputy Communications Director of the Chicago Park District, said they were installed by their Harbor Management company, Westrec Marina Management, at the Park District\u2019s request and \u201cat the request of the boaters.\u201d The buoys are about 50 to 75 yards offshore \u201cto provide clear safe water marks and protect boaters from drifting too close to the rocky shoreline near the Point,\u201d said Tostado.\u00a0Buoys have long been present along the southern bay , but the ones on the north side have not been installed during the first two years of the pandemic.\u00a0Tostado, in an email to the Herald, wrote that \u201cswimming is not allowed at Promontory Point and there are \u2018do not swim\u2019 signs on site to warn patrons to stay out of the water in this area for their own safety. Swimmers may enter the water through Labor Day, Monday, September 5 at the nearest beaches from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. weather/surf conditions permitting.\u201d She also noted the nearest beaches at 57th and 63rd streets, along with Oakwood Beach near 41st Street.\u00a0This has long been a point of contention between swimmers and the city, whereby the Park District does not officially acknowledge the Point as a swimming area, though many people swim there.\u00a0Previously, people have been fined for swimming at the Point, some even detained in custody for entering Lake Michigan. In 1987, the Herald reported on protests that were held by residents in response to the arrests, which increased due to drowning incidents at the Point, \u201cwhere the ban against swimming in restricted areas has not traditionally been enforced.\u201d\u00a0Jorge Sanchez, a lawyer and Point swimmer, recalled representing one person in a case against the Park District, where they dropped the charges when he started to question the statute. Others just decided to pay the fine, he said.\u00a0As recently as 2006, there were lifeguards stationed at the Point, but they were ultimately pulled by the Park District. Swimmers were again warned that if they continued they would face fines or arrests.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cResidents have been deepwater swimming from the ends of the Point south and north since the park opened in 1937,\u201d Debra Hammond, treasurer of the Promontory Point Conservancy wrote to the Herald.\u00a0\u00a0When beaches closed down during the pandemic, a number of more casual swimmers moved over to the Point to swim, which was tacitly allowed, Sanchez recalled.\u201cThey really sort of turned a blind eye to people using the Point,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201c It got really crowded sometimes because it was, I think, just about the only place on the lakefront where you could go in and not be disturbed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The long-time tradition of deepwater swimming at the Point has spawned a large community of swimmers who watch out for each other at the Point, which has coalesced into several Facebook groups.\u00a0Recently though, a number of swimmers have reported jet skis and boats crossing the buoys with greater frequency, endangering swimmers. Jak Gavriel, another Point swimmer, said \u201cI\u2019ve noticed every season there are more of them, racing closer and closer to shore.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Heather La Riviere swims at dawn every day, believing it to be safe from boats and jet skis, and said she\u2019s seen too many close calls.\u00a0With the exception of serious accidents, swimmers typically call 311, the city\u2019s non-emergency line, to report these incidents.\u00a0In July, the Herald reported on a walk that the Park District conducted with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Hairston (5th) and the Conservancy at the Point. According to Jack Spicer, founder and president of the Conservatory, Hairston said very clearly that the buoys were necessary for safety.\u00a0He recalled that she said, \u201cpeople are swimming, people are going to swim, whether you like it or not, we need to save lives. It\u2019s dangerous that there are no buoys there.\u201d\u00a0According to Tostado, the buoys on the north side are expected to remain through October.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

  "text": "Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.ReporterAld. Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) will not seek reelection to a seventh term on City Council next year.\"I am retiring at the end of my term. I will have completed six terms, 24 years. That's a quarter of a century. It's time for the next chapter,\" Hairston said in an interview on Friday.Hairston, 61, said she is \"definitely not retiring for good,\" however, saying, \"I've got a lot of work in me. I've still got a lot of things that I want to do.\" She is a lawyer by profession, having previously worked in Springfield in the state attorney general's office, and said she will serve out her term as Democratic committeewoman of the 5th Ward into 2024.While she has no plans to run for another public office, she is confident that she would have won reelection had she sought it. She is currently unsure about whether she will endorse a successor, noting she is talking to potential candidates but wants to let constituents decide.\"I am not leaving the community: I am still going to be active and engaged, just in a different way,\" she said.Hairston is now the 12th alderperson who began a four-year term in 2019 but will not be serving after Election Day next April. The fact that nearly a quarter of City Council has resigned, been indicted or announced retirements or bids for public office is being taken as a reflection of acrimonious working conditions in City Hall and a greater difficulty in providing constituent services in a world ruptured by COVID-19.At a July 2021 constituents' meeting, Hairston said the council was a place she did not recognize anymore.In the interview, Hairston said she had taken several factors into consideration before announcing her retirement, with the length of her public service being foremost among them.\u00a0Hairston was born in Chicago to Reva and Lester Hairston, a Chicago Public Schools educator and a tavern owner who was the first African American in the city to buy a McDonalds franchise, respectively. She grew up in Hyde Park and South Shore, attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Loyola University Chicago School of Law.As an attorney in private practice, Hairston beat one-term incumbent Ald. Barbara Holt (5th) in 1999 in a runoff, slamming her for the state of constituent services and her ward office\u2019s unresponsiveness; Hairston\u2019s campaign ran with the slogan \"I'll Be There,\" the Tribune reported. The late former Ald. Leon Despres (5th) endorsed Hairston, who has in turn called him a mentor.Hairston had a working relationship with former Mayor Richard M. Daley, praising his administration's investments in the 5th Ward and rapport with alderpersons. She was one of five alderpersons to vote against his catastrophic deal to lease the city's parking meters and corresponding revenue for decades in exchange for an up-front payment. She said she considered running for mayor in 2010 but decided she was not ready to stop being an alderwoman.\u00a0She had frostier relations with former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, criticizing his education policy in particular. She endorsed his runoff challenger, now-U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-4th), against his reelection campaign; after news broke about the police murder of Laquan McDonald, she proposed a more stringent police oversight agency than Emanuel's Civilian Office of Police Accountability.Hairston endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, with whom she served for a decade-plus in City Council, in the 2019 mayoral election.\u00a0Hairston's own election that year would turn out to be the closest of her aldermanic career, as she was forced into a runoff by South Shore community activist William Calloway. He argued, alongside third-place finisher and former Herald editor Gabriel Piemonte, that Hairston had become inattentive to constituent needs after 20 years in office and noted that her council committee attendance was poor. Hairston won by a razor-thin margin, 50.7% of the vote to Calloway\u2019s 49.3%.Hairston has spent the past few years working to get a supermarket established in South Shore; Local Market Foods, 2101 E. 71st St., opened in 2019, after a Trader Joe's in Hyde Park, 1528 E. 55th St., opened earlier that year. In a press release announcing her retirement Friday, Hairston also touted the Obama Presidential Center, the Stony Island Arts Bank, 6760 S. Stony Island Ave., and the South Shore Starbucks, 7101 S. Stony Island Ave.An old associate of the Obamas, Hairston has been a staunch and enthusiastic supporter of the OPC that is now under construction in Jackson Park. After initial resistance, she came out in favor of an anti-displacement community benefits agreement for nearby neighborhoods during her last reelection campaign; after Mayor Lori Lightfoot took office, she worked with her administration and freshman Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) to pass the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance.\u00a0A South Shore Condo Co-Op Preservation Fund Pilot to issue grants to vulnerable owner-occupants in that neighborhood passed the council this July.The now-vice chair of the Finance Committee, Hairston prides herself on thoroughly examining every ordinance before she votes on it. She said her legislative focus on police accountability and reform has stalled against the Lightfoot administration, however. Her ordinances to codify a right to a phone call for those in Chicago Police Department custody within a specific amount of time and another to put regulations on police raids in the aftermath of the botched raid on Anjanette Young have never come up for a vote.\u00a0Hairston did, however, co-sponsor the ordinance that will create Chicago's new police accountability body, the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, which will replace COPA. She worked on it with the Lightfoot administration, other alderpersons, jurists and advocates from the Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC) and Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) coalitions.\"I\u2019m glad to say that we owe Ald. Hairston a debt of gratitude for her service,\" said Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School with whom she has collaborated on police accountability policy, over email. \"There are many politicians who claim to have made a difference, she truly has done so in Chicago, consistently speaking out to serve everyday people and protect the rights of people who have been most marginalized. I am deeply grateful for her service.\"Hairston said she \"will continue the work\" she started in her final nine months of office: \"I cannot be more specific because things pop up all the time. I want to continue to work on the South Shore condominium pilot program; I would like to see that expanded into the other communities. I'm going to continue doing my job and loving every minute of it, like I do now.\"\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"The students I have supported, the (South Shore) Triathlon kids. There is so much.\"When Hairston and King, who is running for mayor, depart City Council, Hyde Park will have an entirely new aldermanic delegation, similar to how the area had an entirely new state legislative delegation in 2019. A few precincts of northwestern Hyde Park have been drawn into the 20th Ward, where the incumbent, Ald. Jeanette Taylor, has said she will run for reelection.Just one candidate, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode, has said he is running for alderman of the 5th Ward, and no one has declared candidacy in the 4th Ward.As her long goodbye begins, Hairston said she did not enter public life for any kind of status.\"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community,\" she said. \"That is what was most important to me and what will continue to be most important to me.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comCook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle served on City Council with Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) from 1999 to 2010.\"I knew Leslie when she first ran in 1999. She's been a friend and a colleague for a very long time. For a decade, she was a friend and colleague. She's still a friend, and she, of course, is part of our 'Hyde Park Mafia' that has done so well in local politics,\" Preckwinkle said.\"I think there's been a tradition of independent, Democratic progressive \u2014 however you want to call it \u2014 leadership in the community and in the 4th and 5th wards. I think that's something of which we can all be proud, and I'm sure Leslie is proud of the two and a half decades she's served as alderman of the 5th Ward.Ald. Sophia King (4th) has served with Hairston since 2016 and issued a statement in her capacity as chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, of which Hairston was a founding member.\"Saddened but not surprised. The City Council is losing one of its most fervent and vocal leaders in the progressive space. Ald. Hairston has championed and was an early supporter for many of the progressive causes for which we are just now seeing the fruits of her labor like civilian oversight of the police. She will be missed but we will continue to carry the torch which she has valiantly held for so many years. I wish her the best in her next chapter,\" said King.Mayor Lori Lightfoot issued a statement: \"I thank Ald. Leslie Hairston for her decades of committed service to the 5th Ward and our city. Throughout her years of leadership, she was forward-thinking and always put her residents first as she tirelessly advocated for criminal justice reform, neighborhood development and so much more. I wish her all the best in this next chapter of her career and am confident we\u2019ll continue to see great things from her.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

King Drive, currently surrounded by a chain-link fence.\u00a0EditorThe Statue of the Republic, located at the intersection of East Hays and South Richards Drives in Jackson Park, has been listed in the Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement as one of the features of Jackson Park to be restored as a consequence of the construction of the Obama Presidential Center.\u00a0The equestrian statue of George Washington in Washington Park, 5531 S. King Drive, currently surrounded by a chain-link fence.\u00a0Two statues in Washington and Jackson parks that were up for review under the Chicago Monuments Project have been cleared to remain\u2014 with changes.In the fall of 2020, the commission was charged with reviewing and providing recommendations for more than 500 of Chicago\u2019s public monuments as part of a \u201cracial healing and historical reckoning project.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Forty-one city-owned works were ultimately selected for further review, including the statues of George Washington on a horse in Washington Park, 5531 S. King Drive, and \u201cThe Republic,\u201d aka the Golden Lady, 6401 S. Stony Island Ave.In the commission\u2019s report released Friday, August 19, five treatment options were determined for monuments: revising or adding narrative, modifying, re-siting to a more appropriate location, removing or replacing.Monuments under review were selected for promoting narratives of white supremacy, negative depictions of Indigenous people, memorializing figures with connections to racist acts\u2014such as slavery or genocide\u2014, presenting a one-sided view of history and creating tensions in the communities they inhabit. Treatment options varied by the severity of these depictions, connections and omissions.Per the commission, the George Washington monument was deemed historically significant, but does not acknowledge Washington\u2019s hand in slavery. It\u2019s estimated that there were more than 500 enslaved people at Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation.As such, the monument was recommended for permanent artistic intervention, aka modification. The report does not describe what this intervention will entail, writing only that the interventions \u201cwill help viewers reconsider works and their subjects.\u201dThe Washington statue was designed by Daniel Chester French in 1904, who later designed the marble monument to Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. This statue is a duplicate of a 1900 Paris sculpture, and the Chicago version was commissioned by wealthy residents.\u00a0\u201cThe Republic\u201d was recommended for revising or adding narrative, which can take the form of onsite signage, online information or tours. The report notes that the purpose of additional information is to place the monument in a more informed context.\u00a0Jackson Park\u2019s Golden Lady was categorized by the commission as a monument to historic events or places\u2014in this case Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition. In the report the commission concludes that, like many sculptures originating from the world\u2019s fair, \u201cThe Republic\u201d is a tribute to the idea of progress that places the Western tradition, Western Europe and America at the apex of world civilization.The Jackson Park monument is actually a 1918 recreation of a statue presented at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, created to act as a permanent memorial to the fair on its 25th anniversary. The gold-leafed statue\u2014also designed by Daniel Chester French\u2014sits on the site of the original Jackson Park fairgrounds.\u00a0For every treatment option the report says the city will engage community members in the process. These are, however, non-binding recommendations, and it is not yet clear if city officials will follow them.Additionally, preservation or landmark designations may limit or dictate what actions can be taken to implement the removal or physical alteration to a monument or supporting infrastructure.Across the country, contemporary efforts to reevaluate\u00a0monuments for their connection to white supremacy could be said to have begun following the 2015 Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, which resulted in a wave of Confederate memorial removals. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, also sparked a flurry of monument removals around the South.In 2020, upheaval after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis reignited the conversation around the history and purpose of public art. In Chicago, monuments to Christopher Columbus were removed following protestors' attempts to tear them down, resulting in a violent intervention by police.(Previously, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said the move would be temporary, and as of Friday has yet to commit to taking them down permanently.)In February 2021, about six months after the commission was formed, the Chicago Monuments Project released a list of monuments up for public discussion on its website. Via the website and community meetings, the commission sought public feedback on the monuments. During this time they also solicited proposals for new works and monuments to be developed.\u00a0According to the report, about 1,700 people participated in the 36 meetings and presentations hosted by the commission. Through the website, the commission collected about 2,000 responses via a feedback form as well as 40 additional letters and emails.Statues of Christopher Columbus, Abraham Lincoln and Indigenous people\u2014such as \u201cThe Bowman\u201d and \u201cThe Spearman\u201d\u2014received the most public comment. The commission also released a survey titled \u201cAmerican Indian representation,\u201d where the bulk of respondents generally viewed depictions of Indigenous people in monuments as negative or demeaning.\u00a0In total, 13 monuments were recommended for removal and placement in storage, including all three Columbus statues, DuSable Bridge reliefs and several monuments characterizing indigenous people as violent, deceitful or submissive.With the report finished, the commission has turned to evaluating and advancing the recommended treatments for the 41 monuments, including investigating historic designation status and the structural feasibility of deinstalling or altering works.Per the report, the foundation the commission developed for receiving community feedback\u2014online or in community meetings\u2014 on monuments will be adopted by the city to be further-utilized to evaluate additional artwork in Chicago\u2019s public collection.The city will also award $50,000 grants for the planning and implementation of eight projects. These are:The Greater Chatham Initiative\u2019s Mahalia Jackson memorial\u00a0Artists and community groups for a monument to historic events and people that have shaped the Latina/x experience in the Pilsen neighborhood\u00a0The Mother Jones Heritage Project\u00a0Community organizations working to create a monument to honor Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable and his wife Kitihawa, a local Potawatomi woman\u00a0A Chicago Torture Justice Memorial in EnglewoodThe Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project\u00a0A Long Walk Home, for its \u201cVisibility Project\u201d proposal centering on Black women and girls\u00a0A monument to victims of gun violenceThe report notes that most of these pieces under review were created between 1893 and 1940, and share common themes that \u201cprivilege whiteness, social elites and the powerful above all people.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThese values were crystallized with the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893, which brought hundreds of sculptors, architects and artisans to Chicago to design and construct an image of Chicago that aligned with the dominant culture of the day\u2026 In this attempt to align itself with great European empires, past and present, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition set the terms for monuments for the next 50 years.\u201dIn addition to the Golden Lady, two of the city\u2019s Columbus statues were also born out of the World\u2019s Fair; the Arrigo Park statue from the 1893 Columbian Exhibition, and the Grant Park statue from the 1933 Century of Progress.EditorHannah graduated from Columbia College Chicago in 2019.

  "title": "Ald. Sophia King running for mayor, talks city council tenure and public safety",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Her father was the jazz saxophonist Jimmy Ellis, behind the Bronzeville Jazz in the Alley movement with Arthur Pops Simpson, part of the broader Black Arts Movement.Smith plans to use her $40,000 grant to help finance a two-act jazz dance performance piece, \"Memoirs of Jazz in the Alley,\" set to premier at the Auditorium Theatre next summer. She has commissioned multi-instrumentalist Isaiah Collier to create a composition for it, with some quotations from existing jazz compositions alongside new compositions. Collier will perform the piece live with an ensemble, and South Side video artist Rasean Davonte Johnson will do projections.\"It's essentially a dance concert, but with the live music and the projection design complimenting the overall picture of the show,\" Smith said. \"There's going to be 25 dancers on stage.\"Smith said the Auditorium Theatre, 50 E. Ida B. Wells Drive, is paying her to do the show, which means she won't have to pay to rent the space or designers or marketing. But her dancers are going to start rehearsing in October, and she needs to pay them. (The South Chicago Dance Theatre has performances scheduled every month this year in Chicago and on tour alongside educational programs in schools.)\u00a0\"I do a lot of fundraising; mostly foundations support us right now,\" Smith said. \"We're having our first fundraiser this season, and we want to target more individual donors as well. But foundations are our greatest source of grant income.\"There is also earned revenue from performances and educational programming. The South Chicago Dance Theatre's budget this year is $600,000; Smith estimates the music composition, set design, professional development, guest artist fees and payroll going into \"Memoirs of Jazz in the Alley\" is around $80,000, meaning the grant DCASE gave her is paying for around half of it.\"It's huge,\" Smith said. \"DCASE does a lot of good, at least in my experience with arts organizations.\"She said most foundations and government entities fund according to the size of organizations' operating budgets. \"This special grant of $40K doesn't pay attention to size; it just says, 'What do you want to do? We want to give you money to help you do it.'\" Smith said.\"This kind of project grant is what we needed in order to do this show. We couldn't do this show with just our general operating budget that we have. There's no way,\" Smith said. \"As an organization, we've never gotten something like this. So it's really exciting.\"This year's municipal budget included $26 million in new arts and culture investments, including $10 million guaranteed for the grants.The number of CityArts grants have grown from 200 last year to 280 this year, and the amount given per organization has grown from $2,000 to as much as $50,000. This year, South and West Side organizations got 45% of the grants, up from 35% last year. The DCASE cultural grants budget, $20.7 million, is almost up to pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe continued, equitable revitalization of our arts and culture scene remains essential to our ability to recover from this pandemic on a socioeconomic level,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud to increase our grant funding in support of local artists and arts organizations to advance our recovery and bring beauty and life back to our neighborhoods.\u201dMore relief grants are due to come out this year as part of the Chicago Recovery Plan to organizations not able to access other forms of federal economic support. It will include program support for artists and organizations working in neighborhoods through the city's $5 million Together We Heal Creative Place Program.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Total project costs are almost $100 million; finalists were selected based on business readiness, viability, location, design, neighborhood needs and community impact.\u00a0\u201cThese grants invest directly in Chicago\u2019s future by creating more resilient and economically vibrant communities across our city,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a July 18th statement. \u201cWhen our local entrepreneurs have the tools they need to grow their small businesses, they can thrive and make our neighborhoods that much more livable, functional and enjoyable.\u201dThe two area businesses were among 79 grant recipients out of more than 600 applicants.The nonprofit Carver 47 cafe, 1060 E. 47th St., opened in 2020, in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little Black Pearl is the cultural nonprofit dedicated to fostering careers in the arts.\"The cafe and market have been growing and getting a tremendous amount of support from the community,\" said Monica Haslip, Little Black Pearl's founder and executive director. \"We have been receiving all of these requests for catering and really just didn't have the accommodations or the space to do catering.\"The $250,000 grant will be used for an expanded dining area and catering kitchen. Carver 47 will also be able to hire a team and do catering workforce development.\u00a0\"In Little Black Pearl, our mission is to teach the connection between art education and business,\" Haslip said. \"A part of what we are doing now through the market is expanding the work that we're doing in the culinary arts and to really focus on food justice and food security.\u201d\u00a0Part of that effort, Haslip said, is Carver 47\u2019s healthy food-focused cafe menu and market offerings, expanding community access to nutritious meals. The market serves an average of 130 to 150 people a day.\u201cWe consider the work that we're doing in there connected to a larger body of work around narrative change and racial healing,\" Haslip said.\u00a0The cafe's namesake is George Washington Carver, the Tuskegee Institute agricultural scientist and environmentalist.\u00a0Haslip said the cafe's \"vision for that component of our work is around connecting and expanding the narrative about African American icons, and particularly those who have a connection to the arts.\" Carver was also a painter \u2014 his work was displayed at the World's Columbian Exhibition, and while most of them burned in a 1947 fire after his death, they were preserved in documentary footage filmed during his lifetime. His artistic side is a focus of Carver 47.\"A lot of the things that are connected to our vision, which is connecting people to the arts, Dr. Carver represents,\" Haslip said.\u00a0And the cafe is used to train people; one of the Little Black Pearl high school graduates who trained there now works there full-time. In total, eight people work there full-time and four work part-time. Haslip said Carver 47's catering component portends more opportunities for workforce development.Carver 47 is preparing to apply for the permit and has finished designing the new kitchen and expanding dining area. Haslip said she hopes to get all the construction done by the end of the year, with a grand opening around 12 months from now.\u00a0\"As we come back into operations after COVID, many of us have had to reimagine what we offer to the community and make sure it's in alignment with what we need,\u201d said Haslip. \u201cBased on the success of the market, we believe we're on the right track and this catering kitchen will help us create more jobs and more opportunities for the neighborhood.\"In Woodlawn, Urban Market Exchange founder Quandra Speights said she is happy that this year\u2019s grantees are diverse, noting that it gets more people to the table.\"I'm often seeing the same people get these same grants,\" she said. \"I saw a lot of new faces this time.\"She got slightly more than $1.2 million. The plan is for the makers\u2019 space to help small business owners scale and grow their business with specialized equipment, workshops and business support.Speights, a non-practicing attorney with a master's degree in business and a background in corporate human relations, has experience working with startup incubator Sunshine Enterprises, 503 E. 61st St., but she said she realized businesses are often going back into the basements and garages after they complete entrepreneurship coaching. She attributed this to owners struggling with scaling.\"They don't have the money to go into brick-and-mortar. They can't afford the overhead. They can't afford the lights and all that comes with brick-and mortar,\" Speights said. \"But that doesn't negate the fact that a lot of them still want to scale their business.\"When the state was putting orders in for face masks at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Speights said there were home businesses that could have competed for those contracts but lacked a facility, like a co-working space to do the work.\u00a0\"With maybe one or two other people they could have brought with them, they could have produced 5,000 masks in a few hours. They could have met that (contract), and made their money,\" she said. \"They don't have to actually get a studio space in the maker space, but they have equipment here that they can go utilize.\"When up and running, hopefully by the spring of 2023, Urban Market Exchange will have light manufacturing equipment; Speights described it as a \"mini manufacturing facility.\" One room with sewing machines, another room with laser, T-shirt and 3D printers and laser cutters, and two studios, one for recording podcasts and another for photography, with cameras available for rent.\u00a0Speights is working with corporate philanthropic departments to get discounted equipment, and she is still looking for additional capital funding. The 7,000-square-foot building, 525 E. 67th St., is a gut rehab. Speights hopes getting a loan won't be as \"arduous\" now as it has been before for projects in communities of color; she thinks she needs another $600,000.Though she previously struggled to obtain loans from banks \u2014despite having multiple degrees, money saved and investment properties\u2014 Speights remains hopeful that new initiatives to support small, female-owned or minority-owned businesses will change that.\u00a0In the meantime, Speights added that without this grant, \u201cthis project would be dead in the water.\"The 26 recipients of Community Development Grants issued in May included the Muddy Waters Mojo Museum, 4339 S. Lake Park Ave., and Friend Health, 700 E. 63rd St.The deadline for the final round of grants is Aug. 19, with information at\u00a0chicago.gov/chirecoverygrant.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.PhotographerA group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.The repair and restoration of Promontory Point has been a subject of debate and contention in Hyde Park for more than 20 years. And as of last week, a representative from Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s office told the Herald that the city will support a preservation approach to restoring the Point\u2019s limestone revetment.\u201cThe Park District, along with the Army Corps and Chicago Department of Transportation have a role in ensuring that Promontory Point continues to remain the community asset that it has always been,\u201d said a spokesman from the mayor\u2019s office in a July 18th statement to the Herald. \u201cWe are committed to working with the community on a design that properly addresses the historic nature of the Point\u2026 We are committed to a preservation-based approach and there will be extensive outreach to the community during the planning and design process.\"This statement comes more than a month after Lightfoot\u2019s comments regarding the Point\u2019s preservation sparked outrage among some advocates. In\u00a0an early June interview, Mayor Lori Lightfoot was first asked by the Herald if her office supported preserving the limestone or replacing it with concrete steps, as is in place along most of the lakefront. Though she said liked the way the limestone looks, Lightfoot added, \u201cI don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away.\"\u00a0The reaction was swift. The following week, the Point Preservation Conservancy (a private group advocating for a preservation approach to the design and restoration of the Point) published an\u00a0open letter to the mayor criticizing this statement. They also requested that Lightfoot join them for a walk around the Point.Lightfoot took the conservancy up on that invitation, \u2014accompanied by Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) and the mayor\u2019s Chief Engagement Officer Martina Hone\u2014 joining the conservancy for an hour-long walk on July 4th, shortly after participating in Hyde Park\u2019s 4th on 53rd Parade. According to members of the conservancy, Lightfoot and company were shown the group\u2019s plans for repairing the limestone steps and \u201casked good questions.\u201d\u00a0In the July 18th statement, the Mayor\u2019s spokesman said of the walk, \u201cThe Mayor was grateful for the opportunity to visit the Point with the Promontory Point Conservancy and hear their concerns directly.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0This walk was the latest effort in a renewed push for the Point\u2019s preservation, which was reinvigorated in 2019 following the Chicago Park District\u2019s announcement of a new shoreline study that would include Promontory Point. Over the last three years, a number of different studies have been proposed to explore the cost of rehabilitating the limestone or replacing it entirely, leaving residents concerned about the park's future.In October of that year, the Park District entered into a contract with SmithGroup for a report \"providing design and engineering services for the development of the first phase of a Lakefront Strategic Action Plan,\" which includes Promontory Point. This report has not yet been made public.In July of 2021, Michael Padilla, project manager for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Chicago region,\u00a0reported that $500,000 had been allocated in President Biden\u2019s 2022 budget for a different Chicago shoreline study that would also include a new design plan for Promontory Point.\u00a0Before the funds for Biden's 2022 budget had been appropriated, however, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D) and Lightfoot announced in January of this year that $3 million in funding had been allocated via Biden\u2019s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to produce another shoreline study of the Chicago lakefront. This study, titled the General Reevaluation Report (GRR) would also include Promontory Point.Subsequently, in May of this year, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) made her request for an earmark of $550,000 in Biden's 2023 budget to fund an \"independent third-party study to determine a preferred preservation approach for the design of the Promontory Point Shoreline Project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\"\u00a0The overlapping jurisdictional efforts have created confusion among residents and advocates about the goals of the efforts, and their impact on promoting or interfering with a preservation approach to the design and repair of the park. According to the mayor\u2019s spokesman, however, the GRR study will not conflict with Kelly\u2019s independent third-party study.\u201cThe Park District and Department of Transportation support a preservation approach to Promontory Point, which the Kelly independent third-party study will help to advance. The GRR proceeding forward will not make any design decisions with respect to the Point,\u201d reads the July 18th statement.\u00a0The spokesperson added that all involved city agencies will await the outcome of the proposed Kelly study before making decisions about Promontory Point, and that \u201cthe Chicago Park District will engage the community before finalizing a plan to restore Promontory Point.\"\u00a0In response, the Promontory Point Conservancy released a statement of their own, thanking the mayor\u2019s office for publicly committing to a preservation-approach for the park\u2019s limestone revetment.\u00a0\u201cWe are pleased too that the Mayor is committed to serious community input in the preservation study. This makes a preservation approach at the Point a win-win for the City and for the community,\u201d the conservancy wrote. \u201cWe look forward to working with the agencies to craft a creative, world-class ADA adaptation so all have easy access to the restored revetment and the water. Thank you, Mayor Lightfoot, for supporting preservation of the limestone and taking demolition off the table.\u201dPhotographer",

Woodlawn Ave. The logo was painted by artist Maaly Williams, and Gibson\u2019s grandfather, Jerome Woodward, did the surrounding and interior parts of the container.\u00a0A bright green shipping container has appeared on the northeast corner of Woodlawn\u2019s Flying Squirrel Park, 6600 S. Woodlawn Ave., a soon-to-be home for the area\u2019s newest outdoor cafe. Founded by Woodlawn resident Marquinn Gibson and supported through a city grant, 7323 Chicago Cafe will open later this month with a selection of drinks, salads and sweet treats.\u00a0Owner Marquinn Gibson said he has been in the kitchen from a young age, and was inspired to open the cafe by his grandmother, who migrated to the South Side of Chicago during the Great Migration. \u201cMen in my family (also) cook really well,\u201d he said, \u201c I took something from everybody as I went, and I\u2019ve just gotten curious and honed my skills over the years.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This past fall, Gibson was running a catering business that he founded in 2020 \u2014 right when the pandemic started \u2014 when his friends told him about a new city grant to establish a physical location.\u00a0In October 2021, the Park District announced a grant program called the Alfresco Dining Grant, which aims to encourage new outdoor dining concession concepts that \u201ccreate a destination location for consumers and increase the amount of time spent in the parks.\u201d This park-specific grant is an extension of Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot\u2019s broader Chicago Alfresco, through the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) and Choose Chicago.According to Stephanie Hatch, general manager for the program, 75% of the Alfresco Dining Grant funds were allotted for areas that have a lack of outdoor dining spaces, primarily on the South and West sides. The program is administered by the Chicago Park District and the city, as well as its concession manager Unison Consulting, Inc (\u201cUCG\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0When applying for the grant, Flying Squirrel Park was Gibson\u2019s first choice for a location, since he lives close by. After getting the grant this spring, he has used both it and his own funds to complete the project. Inspiration for the container space comes in-part from Bronzeville\u2019s Boxville community, whom Gibson has worked closely with to understand how to run lights and electricity inside the box.\u00a0Gibson said his goals for the cafe are to build community within his own neighborhood and provide fresh, healthy food to residents.\u00a0Menu items will include juices, smoothies and lemonades, as well as paninis, wraps and salads. For sweets, gourmet ice cream sandwiches such as peach cobbler cookies containing vegan vanilla ice cream will also be offered. Gibson also hopes to have outdoor seating.\u00a0\u201cThe idea is for you to be able to grab and go if you want\u2026 or if you just want to sit and chill, read your book in the park, do some work in the park, while you grab a quick bite,\u201d he said.During Gibson\u2019s interview with the Herald, a driver stopped their car to ask about the box. After he explained the incoming cafe, the driver responded excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot of that,\u201d Gibson said.For some neighbors, however, the reception has been less favorable. Mike Medina, president of the Woodlawn Avenue Block Club who lives across the street from the park, said that he and his neighbors did not receive notice about the box.\u00a0Medina added that residents have long been concerned about pedestrian safety at that corner, recounting a recent collision in which \u201cone car hit the fence that\u2019s immediately adjacent to the park benches and water fountain.\u201d It\u2019s only a matter of time, he speculated, before a vehicle leaves the roadway and ends up in the park.\u00a0Beyond safety, Medina noted that the park itself could use some upgrades, such as a refurbished entrance and egress, as well as the land regraded. The uneven ground is affecting the box too, which has to be propped up on one side with a brick.\u00a0\u00a0The grand opening is tentatively scheduled for Saturday, July 30th from 12 p.m. - 6 p.m. at 6600 S. Woodlawn Ave., and will feature a DJ, outdoor games, face painting for kids and giveaways.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

If the pilot is successful, it will expand to other properties in South Shore.This fund comes at a time when the ongoing construction of the Obama Presidential Center and renovations of Jackson and South Shore parks are heightening concerns about gentrification.Both Lightfoot and Hairston noted the large number of South Shore residents that are older and on fixed incomes. The lakefront neighborhood has a number of single-family homes and multi-unit buildings with condominiums and apartments; many of the Black condominium owners are at risk of conversion because of their inability to pay for deferred maintenance or get loans with longer terms than five to seven years.From the council floor, Hairston said the pilot was something she had been working on for two decades, noting that the idea came about during the widespread conversion of apartments to condominiums during the 2000s housing bubble.\"Then the market crashed in 2008, so then we had a big exodus (of buyers),\" she said. \"As we move in these times, we have to find a way to keep the people who are our taxpayers, who are our voters, who are our teachers, our nurses, our plumbers, our electricians, our postal carriers \u2014 who have saved their money and purchased \u2014 stay in their homes and and their condos when good things are happening in the neighborhood.\"As we know as people age and the income does not match the rate of inflation, then we need to do something to help our residents to stay in their housing.\u201dBut the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition said the fund falls short of community needs. At a City Hall press conference Wednesday morning ahead of the vote, members of the coalition spoke out against the proposal, noting that a portion of the South Shore fund comes from the city\u2019s Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund.\u201cOur coalition knows that displacement is a reality for renters, condo owners and homeowners,\u201d said Chinella Miller, an organizer with Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization (KOCO). \u201cBut the mayor is taking from one group to give to another. This is not equitable policy.\u201dAccording to data collected by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, about 77% of South Shore residents are renters.Organizers also said the city has moved too slow on guaranteeing protections for renters at risk of displacement.\u201cThe city said this is just the first step. Well, it's been nine months since we announced our demand and seven years since the Obama Presidential Center was announced,\u201d said South Shore resident Brandon Patterson. \u201cRents have been going up, real estate speculation is through the roof and people are already being displaced.\u201dIn November 2021, the CBA Coalition released a list of demands and policy recommendations to safeguard against displacement. Among the demands are bookmarking city-owned vacant lots in the neighborhood for affordable housing development and allocating money to programs such as the Chicago Low-Income Trust Fund, to subsidize affordable units.Since then, Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) member Savannah Brown said the coalition has been frustrated by what they said is minimal communication from the mayor\u2019s office, DOH and Obama Foundation regarding this issue.\u201cThey have not been communicating with the CBA Coalition and, again, the CBA Coalition has been fighting against displacement for people on the South Side,\u201d said Brown.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Chinella Miller of the\u00a0Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization (KOCO) speaks at a press conference with the CBA Coalition ahead of Chicago City Council's Wednesday meeting, July 20.ReporterChicago City Council greatly expanded the number of city properties eligible for a transit-oriented development (TOD), a program that incentivizes building more mixed-use developments\u2014 such as housing, offices, retail and parks\u2014 within a short walking distance of public transit.\u00a0Per the Connected Communities Ordinance, passed in council Wednesday (36-10), TOD incentives will be extended to a standard four-block radius around rail stations and two-block radius around certain bus stations.\u00a0Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) supported the ordinance; Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) missed the meeting due to illness.TOD benefits include parking relief, which eliminates minimum parking standards and puts a ceiling on the maximum number of parking spaces that can be built, and a density bonus that developers can receive to build more square footage without having to pay a fee.Much of Hyde Park and the surrounding area was included under a 2019 TOD pilot that only included market-rate homes. During the pilot, TOD projects have been built at the terminus of the CTA Green Line in Woodlawn, and in January 2021, the mixed-use 43 Green project, next to the 43rd Street Green Line station and along the 43 bus route in Bronzeville, won Chicago Plan Commission approval in Bronzeville.Nevertheless, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office cited a 2020 analysis of developments that accessed TOD incentives between 2016 and 2019 that found that 90% of TOD projects were built in the North and Northwest sides and downtown, including the West Loop.\u00a0Bolstering transit-adjacent investments in the immediate area, several local CTA bus routes have been made eligible for TOD benefits under the new ordinance: the 2 Hyde Park Express, the 3 King Drive, the 4 Cottage Grove, the 6 Jackson Park Express, the 15 Jeffery Local, the 26 South Shore Express, the 28 Stony Island, the 43 43rd, the 47 47th, the 55 Garfield, the 63 63rd, the 67 67th-69th-71st and the 71 71st/South Shore.In a statement about the ordinance, Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Marisa Novara said that development near transit maximizes housing affordability and accessibility, as well as improves pedestrian safety and better connects people to their jobs. \"The passage of the Connected Communities Ordinance strengthens our commitment to development near transit that prioritizes people, safety and affordability, and is a big step toward more equitable outcomes by race and income across the city.\u201dThe ordinance also includes pedestrian safety standards on new construction near rail stations, incentives for putting in affordable units in TOD projects and protections against the loss of two- and three-flats near transit in communities facing displacement pressures by requiring special permission to replace multi-family homes with single-family homes.Steven Vance, an urban planner and the founding CEO of Chicago Cityscape, a real estate information platform, said that the ordinance\u2019s cost-reductions for developers \u2014such as by not requiring parking\u2014 could translate to savings for residents.\u201cThe idea is, Chicago has pretty good transit, we should allow more people to live near that good transit, so let's make it cheaper to build there,\u201d said Vance. \u201c(The ordinance) allows property owners to build more units than NIMBYism or zoning rules would otherwise allow, and require them to not build too much parking because cheap or free parking causes a lot of unnecessary trips by car, which ruins the pedestrian-oriented nature that the area around transit-dense neighborhoods should have.\u201dAdditionally, WTTW reports that an anti-aldermanic prerogative provision that would have allowed three-unit residences to be built in wealthy neighborhoods near transit hubs without City Council permission got stripped during the ordinance's committee hearing.The council also passed a measure creating the South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance.\u00a0The three-year pilot, which will utilize the DOH Troubled Buildings Initiative and the Chicago Community Loan Fund (CCLF), is beginning with the building at 6931-39 South Crandon Avenue.

It failed 18-26; King and Hairston voted for it, having pledged support for it last month out of concerns about equity.According to a January report from the University of Illinois-Chicago, a disproportionate number of tickets issued to drivers who broke traffic laws have come from red light and speed cameras in majority-Black and brown communities, and low-income neighborhoods.That same report, however, also associates the city\u2019s speed cameras (analyzing a period prior to the 6 to 9 mph ticket ordinance) with a 15% decrease in traffic fatalities and serious injuries. (The report examined the safety-impact of 101 speed camera locations from 2015-2017, comparing the rate of traffic accidents near the cameras to a period from 2010-2012, prior to when the cameras were installed.)\u00a0Deviating from local Alds., South Side Ald. Michelle Harris (8th) voted against the measure, noting pedestrian deaths in her ward due to speeding vehicles.\u00a0\"Speed kills,\" she said, recalling witnessing a pedestrian's death on Cottage Grove Ave., which she called an \u201cunofficial highway.\u201dThere are two cameras locally, both near Washington Park: at 536 E. Morgan Drive and 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave. Motorists caught speeding by the cameras are sent $35 fines.The council also passed an ordinance that would allow the Chicago Police Department to impound cars that have been used in drag races and other reckless, showoff driving and a revision to the city's ethics ordinance that ups the maximum fines the Board of Ethics can levy, expands conflict-of-interest provisions and disallows former alderpersons from being able to access the council floor to lobby incumbents.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "(Left to right) Sean Harden, Leon Walker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush and Samir Mayekar cut the ribbon for Friend Health's new Woodlawn Health Center, July 8, 2022.Editor(Left to right) Sean Harden, Leon Walker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush and Samir Mayekar cut the ribbon for Friend Health's new Woodlawn Health Center, July 8, 2022.After 25 years in Hyde Park, Friend Health is opening its new headquarters and flagship medical clinic in Woodlawn. Located at the corner of Cottage Grove Avenue and 63rd Street, Friend Health\u2019s new facility is expected to alleviate the area\u2019s severe shortage of health care providers when it officially opens in late-July.During the facility\u2019s July 8 ribbon-cutting, Friend Health CEO Verneda Bachus said the $43 million clinic will provide comprehensive primary care: family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, pediatrics and a pharmacy. Mammograms and ultrasounds will start being offered, as will a same-day-need clinic.\u201cThis is a day that will change the future of Woodlawn because it will change thousands of lives on the South Side of Chicago,\u201d said Bachus. She added that Friend Health intends for the facility to serve \u201cas a hub for community wellbeing\u2026 a place where the people of Woodlawn and the South Side of Chicago come, not only for healing, but to maintain and support healthy lifestyles.\u201dBachus estimates that the new clinic will serve 35,000 patients annually. Friend Health is also a federally qualified health center, meaning it receives federal funding and must provide affordable treatment regardless of insurance, financial or immigration status.At Friday\u2019s ribbon-cutting, Friend Health Board Chairman Sean Harden \u2014a lifelong South Sider\u2014 attested that Woodlawn residents have long lacked access to quality health care. He said this lack of access has contributed to poorer health outcomes compared to neighboring communities.\u201cThere's one study that suggests that just a few miles north of here, your life expectancy is 85-years-old. But for my residents, their life expectancy is 75-year- old,\u201d said Harden. \u201cThat can't go on. And today marks the first step in changing those statistics.\u201dIn addition to expanding health care access, Harden said the facility is expected to create 250 new permanent jobs.\u00a0After the project at\u00a0 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave. was first announced in May of 2020, Friend Health sought and received $8 million in tax increment financing (TIF) money for its development. In July of 2021, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) also sought and received $250,000 for the project in the appropriations process.\u00a0Rep. Rush also attended the event, along with Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) who stressed community-involvement throughout the project\u2019s development, was unable to attend due to an illness.\u201cFor far too long, communities like Woodlawn have gone without resources\u2026 There should never be a time in one of the wealthiest cities in the world, where the life expectancy of Black people in our city is 10 years less than any other demographic,\u201d said Lightfoot. \u201cWith the grand-opening of Friend Health\u2019s Woodlawn Health Center, residents of Woodlawn and others from the surrounding communities will finally receive the local access to vital health care that they have always deserved, and needed.\u201d\u00a0Lightfoot added that the $43 million center was also awarded by a $2.5 million Chicago Community Development Grant in May of this year, a development grant through the city\u2019s Covid-19 economic\u00a0 recovery plan.The project\u2019s developer, DL3 Realty, has been a key player in the development of the corner at 63rd and Cottage Grove over the past several years. DL3 Realty\u2019s managing partner Leon Walker said at Friday\u2019s ribbon-cutting that the Friend Health development is part of the firm\u2019s \u201cfour-corner strategy\u201d to revitalize the area.Walker said the team is now moving onto construction of the second-phase of its medical campus: a new 15,000 square foot annex building across the street, to be completed in the fall of 2022. This second building will house parking, retail and a dental suite for adults and children, serving Medicaid, Medicare, no-insurance and commercial patients.Friend Health was founded in 1997 by the merger of two University of Chicago clinics. It currently operates six locations on Chicago\u2019s South Side including Back of the Yards, Gage Park/West Englewood, Hyde Park/Washington Park, Woodlawn, West Elsdon and a school-based health center in Bronzeville. The low-income provider serves about 47,000 patients annually across these clinics, 96% of which are Black or Hispanic, while about three-quarters are under the poverty line.\u00a0\u201cThese services are a literal lifeline for individuals and families regardless of their ability to pay, their immigration status, whether or not they have insurance; none of that matters, because we all deserve to have access to quality health care,\u201d said Harden. \u201cWhether it's being responsive to critical life saving interventions, annual checkups or preventative care, that will all be here for everyone to take advantage of.\u201dEditorHannah graduated from Columbia College Chicago in 2019.

In the June 9 interview, Lightfoot said, \u201cWe're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers\u2026 Of course I love the way (the limestone) looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away.\"As a response, the Conservancy \u2014who have long advocated against proposals to replace the limestone with concrete\u2014 wrote in a letter to Herald on June 20, addressed to Lightfoot: \u201cWe would be pleased and honored to walk the Point with you sometime soon so you can see the condition of the revetment for yourself.\u201dAnd so they did. According to the Conservancy, they walked the Point\u2019s shore for an hour. Martina Hone, the mayor\u2019s Chief Engagement Officer, tweeted later that day of the visit: \u201cMayor recently shared how much she loved Promontory Point.

King (4th) lead the 4th on 53rd parade on Monday, July 4, 2022.On Monday morning, floats, marchers and politicians gathered in the parking lot of the Hyde Park Bank, 1525 E. 53rd St., preparing to step off for the annual 4th on 53rd parade. But shortly after 10:15 a.m., news broke that there had been a mass shooting at an Independence Day Parade in Highland Park, a northern suburb of Chicago, which left several dead and dozens injured.\u00a0With marchers queued up and scores of families lining 53rd Street, the parade organizing committee made the decision to continue with the event.\u00a0\"It was a pretty snap decision,\" said parade committee member David White. \"It shook us to our core\u2026 But we felt that it was important for us to continue.\"Though Governor JB Pritzker left the march for Highland Park, a number of elected officials remained; U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D), Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and local Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th). \u201cWe had the opinion that this was an isolated incident,\u201d said White, adding that the politicians\u2019 security details were not concerned about a threat in Hyde Park.And so parade preparations continued. Politicians and community members mingled and sought shade under one of the few trees in the bank parking lot, while the Kenwood Academy Marching Broncos arrived with its brass and percussion booming down S. Lake Park Ave. W.\u00a0Nearby, kids rode around on decorated bikes, forming the parade\u2019s iconic Bike Brigade, while a group of parents distributed signs reading \"Stop Gun Violence.\"Families gather outside the Hyde Park Bank, 1525 E. 53rd St., to watch the 4th on 53rd parade, Monday, July 4, 2022.It was warm and very humid, but a breeze came off the lake providing some relief. In another corner of the parking lot, Mayor Lightfoot posed with the Kenwood Marching Broncos and spoke with the press.\"Democracy, I think, is really on the precipice,\" said Lightfoot. \"But the Fourth of July and thinking about everything that's happened from our origins to where we are now, we have a lot to be proud of. But we also know our journey towards justice is not over.\"As a standard bearer carrying the U.S. flag, Girl Scout Troop 20089 member and Kenwood rising senior Ilona Edstrom has been in the vanguard of the parade for at least four years.\"I think it's a good way to get the community back together. We had so much time apart, \" said Edstrom as she waited for the parade to step off. \" There's a lot of stuff happening in the nation\u2026\u00a0 I think it's important to stay strong as a community.\"The parade kicked off at 11 a.m., with Grand Marshall Preckwinkle leading the way. Lt. Gov. Stratton, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kim Du Buclet and Alds. King and Hairston were at her side. Though they smiled and waved at the crowd, the politicians were understandably a bit subdued, a little less effusive in their engagement with the public than during past parades.\u00a0Members of the Broken Arrow Horseback Riding Club wave to spectators during the 4th on 53rd parade, Monday, July 4, 2022.\u00a0The parade flowed along its usual route (south on Lake Park Ave. to 55th St.,\u00a0east on 55th St. to E. Hyde Park Blvd., north on E. Hyde Park Blvd. to 53rd St. and then west on 53rd St.) into Nichols Park, where marchers and spectators alike enjoyed magic shows, musical performances, horse rides, face painting, refreshments and more.According to White, parade participants said the number of spectators lining 53rd street seemed much higher than in past years. Though the community celebrations pressed on in spite of the tragedy in Highland Park, White noted that future events may need to proceed with caution.\"What do you say to mad men who are willing to do anything to hurt?\" asked\u00a0 White. \"I think every parade now is going to have to really consider this, and bake in some sort of plan for the unthinkable.\"Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.\u00a0ReporterThe Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.\u00a0Local and state elected officials are aghast at the United States Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which has ended the constitutional, nationwide right to an abortion.Abortion rights are still protected in Illinois, however, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said today that he would call the General Assembly into a special session to further protect that right after the court issued its decision.\"We knew this day was coming,\" he said at a press conference in Rogers Park. \"The extremists on the Supreme Court have made an abhorrent decision, one rooted in partisanship, leaving an indelible stain on our nation.\"\"To the right-wing officeholders who today are cheering the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: get your iron boot off women's necks! Hop off your high horse and know that what you\u2019re calling a 'celebration of life' today will actually lead to death \u2014 the death of women in abusive situations, the death of women whose health is at risk, the death of women and girls who will still seek abortions\u2014ones that are unsafe and performed by unqualified back-alley butchers.\"He was non-committal about what legislation the General Assembly may consider beyond measures ensuring there are enough medical professionals to care for the people expected to come to Illinois to get abortions.WTTW reports that other bills under consideration may be ones to strengthen protections for abortion care and to provide resources for people coming to the state for abortions. Senators could also pass a bill to prevent state officials from disciplining providers for providing abortions.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in her own news conference, threatened lawsuits against states who would punish people coming to Illinois for abortions \u2014 threatening Indiana for allowing guns to be trafficked across the state line if a precedent exists for people to sue those who come to Illinois for abortions \u2014 and promised to protect abortion rights in Chicago.Lightfoot, Chicago's first openly gay mayor, has previously stressed the vulnerability of federal LGBTQ rights if abortion rights fell.Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said the court\u2019s decision will not prevent women from getting abortions.\u201cWhat this decision will do is force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, or seek dangerous and unregulated means for an abortion,\u201d Preckwinkle said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will disproportionately impact women of color and poor women, like all policies built on inequity. It also removes all women's right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Under this ruling, contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights are now under attack. Illinois and Cook County will remain a safe haven for women, but as we deal with this harsh reality, we must continue to strengthen our resolve and fight back.\u201dState Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) called the decision \u201ca threat to broader fights for justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ca gateway for the far right to start attacking so many important rights we have today,\u201d one that \u201cwill not reduce abortions, but only further penalize working class communities especially working class Black and Brown communities.\u201d\u201cIllinois continues to lead the country when it comes to protecting the reproductive rights of our residents, and I know we will be a welcoming, safe place for people from hostile states that may be seeking an abortion,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to the organizers and the movement who demanded that Illinois be a leader on reproductive justice, and I am committed to working with them and my colleagues to expand people\u2019s rights in Illinois, not restrict them. I want to be clear that this is the beginning of a much broader movements\u2019 plan to attack marginalized communities and we must not back down from this challenge, but stand up and step out.\u201dIn a statement released from his mayoral campaign, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) called the court's decision \"rooted in misogyny and extreme political views.\"He tied health care access to women, and particularly Black women, being on a path to economic opportunity, linking that with his co-sponsorship of Illinois' Reproductive Health Care Act. He promised to fight for women as mayor of Chicago.U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) noted that the decision will hurt poor, rural and disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, and added that \u201cit opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban.\u201d\u201cIf the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers and children instead of prohibiting healthcare access and oppressing women,\u201d Rush said in a statement.In an interview, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) said Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, who voted with the majority, should never have been appointed to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama from appointing Justice Antonin Scalia's successor after his death and then refused to follow a precedent they set after the 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\"I hope that people realize that elections have consequences,\" Kelly said. \"If people don't vote, this is what happens.\"In a statement, Ald. Sophia King (4th), a former vice chair of Planned Parenthood Chicago, said pro-abortion rights people would not retreat but double-down and \"use this moment to galvanize and expand our base.\"\"The conservative movement is not done,\" she said. \"We expect rulings that will curtail or outright gut programs like affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and other hard-fought rights and programs that have moved this country forward. This attack undermines all of those and more. This is why it is so important that we come together and use every vehicle possible to protect our rights. Let's start by leveraging our voting power.\"Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), an attorney, called back to the 20th century civil rights battles and said they are continuing today.\"To be a woman, and to be a woman of color \u2014 there's just no end to the attacks,\" Hairston said. \"They keep on coming.\"\"It's going to impact Black and brown people most, as has every law that's been enacted. What the Supreme Court did today is unheard of,\" she said. \"Taking away people's rights? And while I haven't read the opinion yet, Justice Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact that nobody has the right to privacy, so it's very serious to me. Are we going to start tagging women from other states to make sure that they don't cross state lines? What exactly does it mean and at what point is it enough? This is not only deadly, but it takes us back centuries.Hairston added that people \u201cneed to be organizing more than ever. We are back to the '60s\u2026 Anybody who was born in the '80s, '90s or even the 2000s has no idea what this means.\"Pritzker was similarly dire.\"They've just taken away rights from more than half of the population of the United States,\" he said. \"Is this serious? Is this one of the worst things that's happened in our lifetimes, that the Supreme Court has done? I've been alive 57 years. They haven't taken away rights in my entire lifetime, and they're aiming to take away more rights.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comUChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine's teaching hospital, issued the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization:\"As an academic health system based in Illinois, where abortion remains legal, and the only hospital-based abortion provider on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the University of Chicago Medicine plays an essential role for the community and for patients needing high-quality care.\"Our organization has a lengthy record of providing high-quality, evidence-based reproductive healthcare and a strong reputation of training the brightest future physicians to offer these clinical services to patients. This involves a broad range of medical care, including abortion, contraception/family planning, fertility treatment, care for general and high-risk pregnancies, and miscarriage management. These are common services that are integral to obstetrical and gynecological medicine and a vital part of comprehensive medical education for physicians in training.\"Our health system remains committed to providing the full spectrum of safe reproductive healthcare and is preparing for how we can best serve patients who travel to Illinois to seek our care and services.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The speed camera at 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.ReporterThe speed camera at 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.The City Council delayed a vote on an ordinance that would end the $35 tickets Chicagoans pay if traffic cameras catch them going six to 10 mph over the speed limit. Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) voted for the ordinance in committee on June 21, and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) also says she supports it.Mayor Lori Lightfoot's council allies used a parliamentary tool at the body's June 22 meeting to postpone a vote until the council's next meeting, scheduled for July 20.The speeding tickets went into effect as part of the mayor's 2021 budget, which King and Hairston voted for and Taylor voted against.Even if the ordinance passes the council \u2014 it passed the Finance Committee by a one-vote margin \u2014 Lightfoot could veto the ordinance.At the committee meeting, King said ordinance supporters do not want to reduce revenue or safety. She noted that the ordinance doesn't change the speed limit, just the threshold at which point people who are speeding will get a ticket.\"I just don't want to balance the budget on the backs of those who are least able to afford it,\" she said. \"In terms of equity, I think we definitely need to look at that.\" She compared DuSable Lake Shore Drive to 'the wild, wild West\" and said there are more opportunities for revenue and safety.According to a January report from the University of Illinois-Chicago, a disproportionate number of tickets issued to drivers who broke traffic laws have come from red light and speed cameras in majority-Black and brown communities, and low-income neighborhoods.\"I really want us to look at real equitable and safe solutions,\" King said. \"There are lots of places in this city that would be more equitable, that wouldn't just be in Black and brown communities, and we could make the city safer and make more revenue.\"Hairston said at the committee meeting everyone is committed to making sure people are safe.\"I see us collecting tickets seven days a week year-round,\" she said. \"We cannot say that we are not balancing the budget on the backs of the people, particularly the backs of the Black and the brown people, because that's where the data shows.\"People who are driving crazy will continue to drive crazy, and guess what? They will be ticketed, because they should be ticketed. So there's no question. I don't understand why there's no cameras in Lincoln Park. It's quite the assumption that people in Lincoln Park don't speed.\"Per the city's speed camera portal, the nearest cameras are located in the Bucktown and Lakeview neighborhoods.Lightfoot issued a statement after the meeting, saying in part, \"It is simply unconscionable that, after losing 173 Chicagoans to speed-related traffic fatalities in 2021, some aldermen are acting with so little regard for public safety. By state law, the revenues generated by these fines help pay for public safety, infrastructure, after-school programming in parks and schools, Safe Passage workers, and many more vital programs.\"WTTW reports that South Side Ald. Anthony Beale (9th) said the Lightfoot administration has generated between $40 million and $45 million from the speed cameras.Taylor, after the council meeting, echoed King and Hairston, saying people of color are bearing the cameras' price.\"We are taxing poor people again. If we hate poor people, just say we hate poor people,\" Taylor said. \"There are other ways to make money. Tax the rich.\"She said studies should be done on every speed camera in Chicago to gauge their effect on public safety.There are two cameras locally, both near Washington Park: at 536 E. Morgan Drive and 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Go get \u2018em!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0That was Sandra Bivens\u2019 rallying cry at the 13th annual Woodlawn Community Summit, a free networking event for business owners, city officials and residents to discuss housing, public safety and economic development in the community.\u00a0The summit, co-hosted and sponsored by the South East Chicago Commission, took place Saturday morning at the University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, 969 E. 60 St.Bivens, a Woodlawn resident and the executive director of the\u00a0Washington Park-Grand Boulevard based\u00a051st Street Business Association, kicked off the event with a mid-morning panel discussion centered on two topics: The City\u2019s development plans for the neighborhood, and available grants for businesses and homeowners to renovate their properties and develop new neighborhood amenities.These developments and grants come as the City prepares for the opening of the long-controversial Obama Presidential Center (OPC), now under construction at Woodlawn\u2019s east end.\u00a0\u201cWe want Woodlawn to have all the services and amenities you would expect in a healthy neighborhood,\u201d\u00a0 said Department of Planning and Development Commissioner Maurice Cox, a panelist. \u201cCulture, recreation, health care, public transit, retailers, restaurants\u2026 We\u2019re excited to be able to ride the [OPC\u2019s] coattails.\u201dBefore an audience of more than 100 attendees, Cox detailed the City\u2019s plans for \u201creimagining Woodlawn.\u201d He described a\u00a0 \u201ccharm bracelet\u201d approach by city planners to draw tourists from the OPC westward, deeper into the Woodlawn community.\u00a0It\u2019s at Cottage Grove Avenue where the City is hanging its first charms, according to Cox. A zone about 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the OPC\u2019s Jackson Park campus is already under development, anchored by the CTA\u2019s Cottage Grove Green Line station at 63rd Street. The area surrounding the station is a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district where more than $150 million is being invested in new construction.\u00a0That includes an overhaul of the CTA station; construction of the new 45,000-square-foot Friend Health headquarters and clinic; and a retail and residential complex called Woodlawn Park Station, to be built by private developer DL3. The first phase of Friend Health construction is nearly complete and the facility will open next month, Cox said. A second building is planned, along with a parking structure.\u00a0The Chicago Public Library\u2019s Bessie Coleman branch will move to the locale, and the Washington Bank building will be renovated for offices, retail stores and a food court.\u00a0Closer to the OPC, the City owns a two-block stretch of 63rd Street adjoining the Hyde Park Day School, 6254 S. Ellis Ave, and the University of Chicago\u2019s charter school at 6300 S. University Ave. Cox said the City plans to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for six new mixed-use buildings to be developed there, over the next seven to 10 years.\u00a0Vacant city-owned lots from 63rd to 65th Street will also be named in RFPs for the construction of new homes. \u201cWe want to fill in the missing teeth along those streets,\u201d Cox said. The City would dedicate clusters of residential parcels to specified types of housing: single-family homes, townhomes, or two- or three-flats.\u00a0Cox added that 30 percent of the residential units throughout these new developments would be affordable, meeting the requirements of the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which was created to help combat OPC-driven displacement of residents. The ordinance, passed as a compromise to a long-fought for community benefits agreement, mandates that, \u201con 25% of city-owned vacant land, 30% of units in each project must be affordable at 30-50% of Area Median Income.\u201dHe said the City will not designate individual parcels for affordable housing until larger plans for the surrounding area have solidified: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this piecemeal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Cox was asked about a sprawling development envisioned by J. Byron Brazier and his father, Pastor Byron Brazier of the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave. The megachurch has acquired much adjacent property, and in December of 2021, the pair presented a model of Woodlawn Central, an eight-acre \u201ccultural complex\u201d they want to develop at a cost of $600 million. Among its amenities would be a hotel, retail and office space, performance venues and up to 870 units of mixed-income housing.\u00a0Responding to the question, Cox said, \u201cThe market will do what the market will do. We can\u2019t control it\u2026But I would not lose a lot of sleep over this. I\u2019ve seen dozens of projects like this and, literally, in my two years as commissioner I have not seen a single one advance. It\u2019s one thing to hire an architect to do a vision. It\u2019s another thing to get it financed by a bank and get it constructed.\u201dThough the OPC is controversial, the dollars under discussion, available through a variety of grants panelists detailed, were real. Some of them are linked to Woodlawn\u2019s two TIF\u00a0districts. Others, including federal pandemic-recovery grants, are available to Chicagoans citywide. There are grants for new business and cultural initiatives, and for renovating existing homes and businesses. Low- and middle-income Woodlawn residents threatened with displacement may qualify for help with rent, mortgage payments or property taxes.\u00a0Bivens acknowledged the application process for grants can be intimidating, especially for first-time applicants. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared of these grants,\u201d Bivens said. \u201cYou do have to have a game plan. And a lot of people are going after these funds, so you may not get that first grant, but try it! You may surprise yourself.\u201d\u00a0Said Bivens to the group, \u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019ve been living in Chicago, you know how it works. You gotta know somebody.\u201d She nodded toward Cox as he pocketed the phone number of a young man looking for help with a nonprofit venture. \u201cNow you know somebody.\u201d\u00a0After the plenary session, an hour was devoted to breakout meetings on three topics: home ownership, sustainable development and public safety. The networking session for current or prospective homeowners was overseen by Associated Bank\u2019s Paula Grant, vice president for residential lending. The Chicago Police Department\u2019s 3rd District commander, Roderick Watson, led the public safety session focused on collaboration between police and community residents. The sustainability session was led by Naomi Davis, founder of Blacks in Green.\u00a0Members of Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP)\u00a0march outside the Crown Family School building, 969 E. 60th St. and attempt to disrupt Mayor\u00a0Lori Lightfoot as she speaks inside the building during the 13th Annual Woodlawn Community\u00a0Summit, Saturday, June 11.Midway through the summit, Mayor Lori Lightfoot arrived to give a brief address. Upon her arrival, members of the Woodlawn-based group Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) marched the sidewalk outside the venue, shouting and carrying signs that read \u201cwe demand affordable housing here.\u201d Since shortly after her election, the group has feuded with the mayor over the Obama Center and the changes it will bring to their neighborhoods.

  "text": "Members of the CBA Coalition rally at the intersection of Wrightwood and Kimball Avenues, down the street from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Logan Square home, Saturday, June 11.Members of the CBA Coalition rally at the intersection of Wrightwood and Kimball Avenues, down the street from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Logan Square home, Saturday, June 11.As construction on the Obama Presidential Library progresses in Jackson Park, community organizations and tenants continue to push for anti-displacement protections for Woodlawn and South Shore residents.On Saturday, members of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition brought their concerns about the lack of affordable and safe housing and the rising cost of living to Wrightwood and Kimball avenues, the intersection closest to Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s Logan Square home. Around 150 people gathered for the rally, forming a circle in the street\u2019s center and cheering, chanting and tending to young children.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had to come together more to have our voices heard under Lori Lightfoot than Rahm Emanuel,\u201d said Porsche Patrice, an organizer with Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP), a Woodlawn-based community organization and coalition member.The CBA coalition was formed in 2016, shortly after Jackson Park was selected as the site for the presidential center, to ensure surrounding residents would be able to have a say in and benefit from the influx of money and new development.\u00a0The City didn\u2019t concede on the agreement, and Barack and Michelle Obama declined to support the CBA or the coalition\u2019s efforts. But over the course of the next several years STOP, alongside KOCO, Not Me We, BYP100 and other groups, helped draft the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which required the city to set aside 52 vacant lots in Woodlawn for affordable housing, and dedicated $4.5 million toward expanding housing programs in the neighborhood, with a focus on low- and moderate-income families, among other provisions.At the Saturday rally, residents spoke in frustration about the City\u2019s slowness to move forward with delivering on the affordable housing development promised in that ordinance and about South Shore\u2019s near-total exclusion from City protections, during what one South Shore resident called the \u201cheight of crisis.\u201d South Shore and Hyde Park were cut out of the 2020 ordinance before its passage.South Shore, where more than three out of every four residents is a renter, has had the highest eviction rate in the city for 12 consecutive years. And although property rates and rental prices have skyrocketed, with single-family home prices nearly doubling in the last year alone, according to Redfin data, coalition members say that the neighborhood has not seen adequate protections extended from the city.\u00a0Among coalition demands are the allocation of city funds toward the preservation and rehabilitation of vacant single-family and multi-unit buildings to protect tenants and homeowners alike. They also list a \u201cRight to Return\u201d policy that prioritizes longterm South Shore residents who have already been or are about to be displaced from the neighborhood.\u201cThe first step is providing more affordable housing,\u201d said Woodlawn resident Marilyn Harper. She said that although she lives in a building owned by a family member, the rising property taxes put her and other family members at risk of rent increase. Other family members have sought out new rental units only to find units that they would struggle to afford even with jobs that pay above the minimum wage of $15 an hour, she added.\u201cWe are two blocks from Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s residence. Why is it that she lives in a beautiful neighborhood and lives in a nice home where she can see her children grow up, she can never worry about being displaced or facing eviction due to rising rent and property tax? We want the same agreement, to live in a community where the rent is affordable and still have money to enjoy the simple things in life.\u201d\u00a0Linda Jennings, a 64-year resident of South Shore, said that as a senior condo owner\u00a0 she feels particularly vulnerable to displacement. \u201cLiving in an elegant prewar structure built in 1928, we have rising infrastructure repair costs and other issues associated with an aging structure,\u201d Jennings said.\u201cThe building next to my condo had those costs. Those condo owners resided over 50 years in their condo. They believed when retirement approached they would have constant stability, living along the lake and that they would enjoy their golden years with a sense of security However it didn\u2019t occur. Rising costs of infrastructure repairs (and other issues) could not be covered by assessments.\u201cOwners fought hard to keep their homes but they lost. A property investor bought the building, paid owners below rate for their homes in an already red-lined neighborhood.\u201dRally speakers noted that neither Lightfoot nor Ald. Hairston (5th) were standing with residents at the rally (South Shore Ald. Taylor (20th) was also not present). Municipal elections will occur in 2023. Lightfoot recently launched a reelection campaign; Hairston has not commented yet on whether she will run for another term. Alds. Taylor (20th) and Hairston introduced the 2020 ordinance as a compromise to legislation introduced by the mayor.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe power structure is working with investors to take over our homes and that ain\u2019t right,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cThese people deserve to live in South Shore and I deserve to live in South Shore.\u201d\u201cYou have a city council and a mayor that is complicit in the changing of the demographic of South Shore. Your vote is not a giveaway.\u201dYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Kwame Raoul (D-13th) celebrates at Valois, 1518 E. 53rd St., after winning election to be Illinois attorney general, Nov. 7, 2018Keen political observers of candidates' ballot filings may have noticed something this primary season go-around: Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul's residence is no longer listed on Drexel Square.He maintained that home while his children were finishing college, and his youngest just graduated. And now, the University of Chicago Lab Schools graduate, two-time 4th Ward aldermanic candidate and former local state senator has moved with his wife to River North.\"Having lived in Hyde Park for the vast majority of my life, I'm in this weird state of no longer being a Hyde Parker, or no longer living or residing in Hyde Park,\" Raoul said in an interview. \"I think Hyde Park resides in me, having spent all my formative years in Hyde Park, attended school in Hyde Park, lived in Hyde Park when I went to college and law school and started working.\"\"It is strange for me,\" he said. He recently had his 40-year Lab School reunion and recalled that it was strange to walk around the neighborhood with old friends, most of whom had left Hyde Park long ago, when he had done it so relatively late in life.\"When I say something like 'Hyde Park is in me,' I'm not exaggerating that. There's just a character to the neighborhood that embraces diversity, enables one's capacity to communicate to different types of people in a way that many neighborhoods may not necessarily foster that just by way of your having lived there for so long,\" he said.\"You can walk down 53rd Street or down Hyde Park Boulevard or down 57th Street and interact with all different types of people. And that lends something to you, particularly for the career path that I've taken on.\"The area still remains a residence of a disproportionately high number of local politicians. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has lived here since she matriculated at the U. of C. Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) live in Kenwood. State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) and Samir Mayekar, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's deputy mayor for economic and neighborhood development, live in Hyde Park, as does Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell, a former state representative.And Raoul's state Senate predecessor, former President Barack Obama, still maintains his voting registration on Greenwood Avenue, though he has lived in Washington since 2009.Raoul may not build a center dedicated to his service as attorney general in the neighborhood after he leaves office \u2014 he is seeking reelection this year \u2014 but he said he will continue identifying with the neighborhood.\"It is me,\" he said. \"From preschool through most of my working career, I lived in Hyde Park.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) look on.Industrial Massillon, Ohio, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's hometown near Akron, was not an easy place to be gay in the 1960s and '70s, and even when she went to college at the University of Michigan, she didn't know many out people in Ann Arbor.She came out in Chicago, after she matriculated at the University of Chicago Law School in 1986.\"Ironically in the conservative U. of C. Law School, there were a lot of gay people,\" Lightfoot said in an interview with the Herald. \"I\u00a0 just really felt like, \u2018OK, this is who I am\u2019 . . . It was just feeling comfortable in my own skin and feeling who I was.\"In addition to that, Lightfoot's Hyde Park years were the first time in her life that she \"really felt Black,\" she said. Lightfoot did not say that this was because she was living in the overwhelmingly Black South Side, but \"because there were so many negative things about being Black in Hyde Park.\"She recalled southward-facing barbed-wire fences on 61st Street \u2014 \"That sent a really clear message: we don't want the surrounding neighborhood, which was overwhelmingly Black, to be a part of the university community.\"Each of her three years of law school included \"a pretty significant racial event\" that she said was either caused or exacerbated by the law school.Bigelow Fellows teach first-year U. of C. Law School students academic legal writing; in Lightfoot's class, nine out of 175 students were Black. A few of the Black students didn't do well on the fellows' first paper, and so one of the teachers suggested putting all of the Black students in a remedial writing course.\"There was a professor there who said around this whole issue that the law school had an obligation to make sure that we were just as good as the white students by the time that we'd graduate. Of course he was white: no Black or brown professor would say such an absurd thing,\" she said. \"The tonality of that really set the stage for really hard stuff.\"Lightfoot also described an incident with another Black student being interviewed by a recruiter from\u00a0 Baker & McKenzie, then one of the country\u2019s largest law firms, during their final year at the school. According to Lightfoot (and reported in the Tribune) the recruiter made a string of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments during the interview, such as using slurs and retorting to the student\u2019s interest in golf that there were \u201cnot many golf courses in the ghetto.\u201d Lightfoot, who was president of the Law Students Association, helped put pressure on the university to suspend the firm from campus for a year.Lightfoot said that Hyde Park today \"is a very, very different place now than what it was.\"\"There were very little amenities, very little restaurants, very few things for a young person, like myself, to really do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole social life was on the North Side.\u201d Lightfoot added that she was \u201ctraumatized\u201d by her time in law school.\u00a0She lived in the neighborhood all three years, but she recalled that the school had buses that would take people to the North Side on the weekends. \"My knowledge and orientation of the city was outside of Hyde Park, not in Hyde Park,\" she said.An exception to that rule was Promontory Point.\"Promontory Point was such an oasis for me when I lived in Hyde Park,\" she said. \"When I first lived in Hyde Park, I lived at 55th and Everett, so right around the corner. So it was so easy for me to get to Promontory Point, and it was just this magical place where you're out there on the lake, people are swimming in the water, and you can see the rest of the city. I have such incredibly fond memories of Promontory Point.\"The thing that concerns me now is it's being washed away,\" she said. \"It's being eroded.\"\"We're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers, and fix it in a way that we're not going to have to come back five years or 10 years from now,\" Lightfoot said.Would that long-term fix preserve the steps' beloved exposed limestone, or would they be replaced by concrete, as is in place on much of the rest of the lakefront?\"Of course I love the way it looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away,\" Lightfoot said.That may be a tough pill for some people to swallow.\"There's a reason it hasn't been fixed yet,\" Lightfoot said. \"I absolutely love Promontory Point.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comMayor Lori Lightfoot announced her bid for reelection on June 7, asking voters for more time to run a city racked by crisis after crisis and touting herself as a fighter who has met those moments who can meet the ones to come.\u201cI don\u2019t look or sound like any other mayor we\u2019ve ever had before, and I\u2019ve had to fight to get a seat at the table. And, like so many in our city, I\u2019ve had to fight to have my voice heard,\u201d Lightfoot said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never back down from fighting every day to turn your voice into action.\u201d\u201cWhen we got knocked down by COVID, we came together as a City and we got right back up. Because that\u2019s who we are \u2013 and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to make so much progress, despite all that\u2019s been thrown at us.\u201cOf course there are tough challenges ahead. We have a lot of work to do, because change just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But together, we will make our city safer, fairer, and more equitable for all. Now, let\u2019s get back to work.\u201dShe campaigned the next day in Greater Grand Crossing, touting her Invest South/West initiative that seeks to spur investment on South and West Side neighborhoods through a combination of private and public funds. The program has targeted corridors in Bronzeville and South Shore; along South Cottage Grove Avenue, it has been tied to the development of the 4400 Grove complex and Northwestern Medicine's planned $100 million outpatient care center.Next February's election has attracted an unusually high number of declared and potential candidates for an election with an incumbent Chicago mayor, including local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th).\u201cMayor Lightfoot has proven to be utterly ill-equipped to lead Chicago,\" he said in a statement. \"Carjackings and violence are at record highs, economic disinvestment is drying up our neighborhoods, our schools are under-resourced, our police department is over-extended and under-staffed. Instead of a public safety plan, she\u2019s raised bridges, put up barricades and demanded curfews.\"\u201cWhen Chicago votes for a new Mayor, they\u2019re picking a new direction for our city. I\u2019m a skilled negotiator who\u2019s brought people together to get things done and passed groundbreaking, comprehensive laws around clean energy, banning ghost guns, and public safety and justice.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Harper Ave.\u00a0Eligible 5th Ward residents overwhelmingly voted to pass two advisory referendums urging newly-elected officials to support a South Shore Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) and build more affordable housing in Woodlawn.\u00a0The two referendums appeared on ballots in several 5th Ward precincts located in Woodlawn and South Shore during the citywide municipal election on Feb. 28. Organizers behind the non-binding ballot measures say they are intended to show the incoming mayor and alderman how important issues of affordable housing and displacement are to 5th Ward voters and propose solutions.In South Shore, a referendum asking a new mayor and alderperson to support a South Shore CBA ordinance appeared on the ballot in nine of the neighborhood\u2019s precincts that border Jackson Park: precincts two through five and seven through 11.The referendum asked if elected officials should support the ordinance \u201cto prevent the displacement of renters, condo and homeowners in South Shore in light of the impact of the Obama Center and growing development in the area.\u201d It suggests that such an ordinance establish a fund for home repairs, provide property tax and rent relief, eviction protection, job programs and the development of 100% affordable housing on city-owned vacant lots.\u00a0Across precincts, 88.79% of voters (2,155 out of 2,427) voted \u201cyes\u201d on the referendum, according to the Chicago Board of Elections.\u00a0\u201cIt's overwhelmingly clear at this point that folks believe in what we're talking about, which is that folks should be able to stay in their neighborhood and benefit from the (Obama Presidential) Center,\u201d said Dixon Romeo, a leader of the CBA Coalition, the group of community organizations pushing for the ordinance. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a holistic package. A South Shore CBA doesn\u2019t prevent any business from happening, but does put things in place so that homeowners, condo owners and renters aren\u2019t displaced by the Obama Center.\u201d\u00a0In September 2020, after years of community conversations and campaigning by organizations in the CBA Coalition, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the Chicago City Council passed the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance. The ordinance required the city to set aside 52 vacant lots in Woodlawn for affordable housing and dedicate $4.5 million toward expanding housing programs in the neighborhood.\u00a0Since its passage, South Shore residents have called for similar protections against displacement in their neighborhood, which were ultimately cut out of the original Woodlawn ordinance.\u00a0In November 2021, the CBA Coalition announced its demands for a South Shore CBA; organizers say they\u2019ve gotten little response from the mayor or elected officials since.A referendum question asking whether the new mayor and alderman should support building affordable housing on the vacant lot at 63rd Street and Blackstone Avenue appeared on a few hundred ballots in Woodlawn.On ballots in the 13th and 14th precincts, the referendum asked if elected officials should support that the city-owned lot be \u201cat least 75% truly affordable housing \u2026 to ensure that residents can afford to stay in the neighborhood as housing costs soar.\u201dIn essence, the referendum urges city officials to develop this lot as part of the Woodlawn ordinance. Affordability, in this case, would require that renters pay no more than 30% of their monthly income towards rent.Signs the CBA has lined up along all city-owned lots they say should be set aside for affordable housing, 2022.Across the two precincts, 91.57% of voters (456 out of 498) voted in favor, according to the Board of Elections.On Election Day, Savannah Brown, a housing organizer with South Side Together Organizing for Power (STOP), a CBA Coalition member, chatted up voters outside of the 14th precinct polling place. She and other STOP organizers were out sharing information about the referendum.\u00a0She said the process to get the lots developed has been too slow. \u201cSince we got the (Woodlawn) ordinance passed, we\u2019ve been asking for these lots,\u201d Brown said.\u00a0 \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been holding onto that one (on 63rd) for some reason.\u201dBrown noted that the ordinance only guarantees these lots affordable for 30 years.\u00a0Activists with the CBA Coalition want to pre-select the city-owned lots to ensure that the developments are located in high-density areas, which would allow for the construction of large buildings (and more units). The 63rd and Blackstone site fits these parameters, and Brown said it will be the closest to the OPC out of the sites selected so far.\u00a0\u00a0Though the referendums are non-binding, \u201cit\u2019s literally going to be a number that says \u2018hey, this is what the people want,\u201d Brown said. She hopes that elected officials will \u201csee the value of using the (recommendations of) people that have lived here and actually giving them the opportunities that have been promised.\u201d\u00a0She is also hopeful that the referendum for a South Shore CBA will push local electeds to an ordinance, noting that the Woodlawn ordinance came after a similar referendum question for a CBA in the 2019 municipal election.Herald editor Hannah Faris contributed reporting.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

Lamont Robinson (D-5th) has emerged as the frontrunner to succeed Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, having won every precinct in the ward in the Feb. 28 municipal election.His failure to clear 50%, however, means he will likely face the apparent second-place finisher Prentice Butler, King\u2019s chief of staff, in an April 4 runoff.Robinson won around 46% of the vote in six of the ward\u2019s precincts in Hyde Park and Kenwood south of 47th Street, just below his ward-wide margin. He appears to have won a majority of the vote in nine of the ward\u2019s 28 precincts.Butler, meanwhile, won almost 18% of the local vote, exceeding his 15% margin across the ward. Third-place finisher Ebony Lucas, a real estate attorney, trailed him ward-wide by less than a percentage point but only won a little less than 13% of the local vote.Separated by a margin of 60 votes, a second place finisher won\u2019t be officially announced until the remaining mail-in ballots are tallied up.Butler and Lucas both polled some of their highest margins in Kenwood. Lucas came in second place in several of the ward\u2019s precincts, but Butler beat her in five of the six in Hyde Park-Kenwood.The probable defeat marks Lucas\u2019 third in the 4th Ward. She lost to King in a 2017 special election after the alderwoman\u2019s appointment to City Council and again in 2019, when she was King\u2019s sole challenger. Lucas won a smaller percentage of the vote this year than she did in her previous two elections.5th Ward aldermanic runoff candidates Desmon Yancy and Martina \"Tina\" Hone.Tina Hone, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s former chief engagement officer and a Hyde Park resident, owes her ticket to the 5th Ward\u2019s runoff election to voters in the neighborhood.\u00a0The overall top vote-getter, South Shore community organizer Desmon Yancy, won a lower percentage of the vote in Hyde Park than he did across the ward, 26.1% versus 23.6%. He nevertheless bettered Hone\u2019s 22.7% margin in Hyde Park; Hone got 17.8% of the overall vote.Yancy, outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston\u2019s endorsee, nearly swept the ward\u2019s South Shore precincts, losing one in the Jackson Park Highlands to businessman Kris Levy by a single vote. (Levy came in seventh place overall, after Woodlawn activist Joshua Gray.)Three other Hyde Parkers, attorney Renita Ward, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode and Jocelyn Hare, who works at the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris Policy Labs, came in third, fourth and fifth place in the neighborhood, winning 13.8%, 13.3% and 10.7%, respectively. Their ward-wide margins were 12.4%, 10.6% and 7.7%.Dee Perkins of South Shore, Marlene Fisher of Greater Grand Crossing, Gabriel Piemonte of Woodlawn and Robert Palmer of Greater Grand Crossing, finished out the pack. Piemonte, a former Herald editor, saw his support drop more than 20 points since the first round of the ward's 2019 aldermanic campaign in which he also ran. Palmer has twice been a candidate for Congress in Illinois\u2019 1st House district.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, who won around 34% citywide, took around 15% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote.Locally, outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot won 34% of the vote in Hyde Park-Kenwood \u2014 up 10% from her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election but down significantly from her margin in that year\u2019s runoff.Johnson and Lightfoot were the only two candidates to carry Hyde Park-Kenwood precincts. Johnson won all but one in Hyde Park, the neighborhood that gave him his highest support on the South Side, winning most of the area\u2019s precincts alongside a handful in Bronzeville, while Lightfoot won the vast majority of majority-Black South Side precincts.Lightfoot\u2019s margin in Hyde Park-Kenwood was slightly higher than her local performance in the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, but her citywide performance destined her to become the first mayor to lose in a primary since Eugene Sawyer, who was appointed to succeed the late Harold Washington, in 1989.In the runoff four years ago, Hyde Park was the only neighborhood in the city that backed Lightfoot\u2019s challenger, longtime local political figure Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County executive.Johnson also did well in racially diverse wards on the Northwest and Far North sides. Vallas carried predominantly white neighborhoods on the South and Southwest sides like Bridgeport, Mount Greenwood, Hegewisch and Clearing as well as downtown, North Side lakefront wards south of Uptown and predominantly white neighborhoods on the Northwest Side.The race presents a sharp ideological contrast between the two candidates. Vallas, who has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, is running a law-and-order campaign amid persistent fears in the city about public safety. Johnson, a former teacher backed by the Chicago Teachers Union and progressives like local state Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th), has called Vallas a closeted Republican.Outgoing local Ald. Sophia King (4th) won around 5% of the Hyde Park-Kenwood vote, up from her 1% citywide margin. State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), who lives in Bronzeville and represents a portion of Hyde Park-Kenwood in Springfield, won just over 2% of the local vote and 1.8% citywide.The other candidates' local margins spanned from less than a percentage point (outgoing 6th Ward Ald. Roderick Sawyer) to just over 9% (4th District U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia).While 45% of local voters turned out for the first round of the 2019 mayoral election, turnout in Hyde Park-Kenwood sagged almost 10 percentage points this year.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

This mayoral and aldermanic elections are rather frightening. The very politicized, very resentful and yes, often hateful CTU Chicago Teachers Union is making a major play to monopolize political power in our city and drag our city down to the worst years of the 1980s when Secretary of Education Bennet pronounced Chicago Public Schools THE Worst in the USA and Time Magazine featured a cover story asking \"Are Cities Dead\".I was and am still hoping we would elect an aldermen/woman that would represent our Hyde Park/U Chicago community as well as the poor, high crime areas to the South. It doesn't look like that will happen. Along with the OPC political takeover of a huge part of Jackson Park, it looks like we are headed for very dangerous, divisive times ahead in neighborhood, city politics, crime, education etc. Many, many good neighbors are now talking about leaving/fleeing.

Jeanette Taylor (20th)Incumbent alderwoman and Woodlawn resident Jeanette Taylor was reelected to her 20th Ward seat Tuesday evening in a comparatively small City Council race, beating out just two repeat challengers.\u00a0With 91% of precincts reporting as of press time, Taylor captured 53% of the vote, according to the Board of Elections. With over half of ballots cast in the ward race for her, Taylor avoided an April runoff election.Retired police officer Jennifer Maddox, who ran for the seat in 2019 and to be the ward\u2019s Democratic committeewoman in 2020, captured about 26.4% of the vote; Andre Smith, a minister and entrepreneur, captured 20.7%.Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) talks to a supporter at her election night party at Studio Imani, 5917 S. State St., Feb. 28.Prior to City Council, Taylor\u00a0was a community organizer\u00a0who fought for a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) for the incoming Obama Presidential Center in nearby Jackson Park and participated in the successful 34-day hunger\u00a0strike to keep Washington Park\u2019s Walter H. Dyett High School from closing.She was elected 20th Ward alderwoman in the 2019 runoffs after Willie Cochran, a three-term alderman, was\u00a0indicted by a federal grand jury\u00a0on corruption charges.\u00a0One of City Council's great firebrands, Taylor\u2019s first-term achievements include passing the\u00a02020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance,a\u00a0landmark piece of legislation\u00a0that contains a suite of housing programs designed to protect both homeowners and residents from displacement due to increases in housing prices and land value.She also\u00a0strove to \"turn power back to the community,\" specifically gaining constituent input in decisions around development and other ward business.\"I've been a woman of my word. I've stood up for my community; I've stood with my community,\" Taylor said in a September interview announcing her reelection bid. \"I still have a lot of work to do. You can't change culture and community in four years, but I feel like the community is moving in the right direction.\"A key issue in the last few months of the campaign has been the city's use of a vacant Woodlawn school as a shelter for migrants coming to Chicago.in early February, after several delays and amid opposition from community members, the city moved more than 100 men and women into the former Wadsworth Elementary School, 6420 S. University Ave.Taylor blasted the sudden move-in, saying Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration has pitted the Black and Latino communities against each other again \"through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands.\"Going forward,\u00a0Taylor said she wants Woodlawn to get resources in light of the systemic racism it has experienced from the city in the past and for Chicago \"to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Harper Ave., for expansion, including an outdoor patio space \u2014 and is part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's $1.2 billion post-COVID Chicago Recovery Plan.The building opened in 1924. The Washington Park National Bank closed seven years later, but the building remained an attractive location for offices for decades afterwards. The late Rev.

  "text": "Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) after a heated discussion in the back of the Chicago City Council chambers, June 23Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) after a heated discussion in the back of the Chicago City Council chambers, June 23Woodlawn is a beautiful community with a history of activism, resilience and care. It has been a home for Black residents escaping the racist South since the early 1900s. Though frequently met with violence, Black families remained and built a determined community. In more recent history, Woodlawn has welcomed Black residents, like myself, being displaced by the gentrification from other neighborhoods in our own city. In the spirit of this legacy, I am urging us to welcome asylum seekers and unhoused local residents to the vacant Wadsworth building. I hope that we can learn from each other, and continue our rich history of community collaboration.Too often, the City of Chicago has pitted Black and brown communities against each other. Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s administration has done just that through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands. I want my community to be respected and supported with resources after decades of racist disinvestment, AND I want our city to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life . We can do both. My office will be hosting a community meeting on February 16th to discuss WITH the community how we can welcome our new neighbors to Woodlawn and demand resources for longtime community residents.\u201dAs a response to what I heard in the previous community meetings, I offered the Mayor and her team the list of demands below to ensure Sanctuary for All in Woodlawn and the 20th Ward as a whole. So far, the Department of Family & Support Services has only agreed to open the shelter to both asylum-seekers and unhoused city residents along with vague commitments to provide immigration services to current 20th Ward immigrants through an existing program and engage Woodlawn neighbors in a community process to determine the use of other vacant Chicago Public School properties in the ward. The vacant Wadsworth building will go through a community process when the shelter closes. I am calling on Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s administration to agree to the following:Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.As a homeowner adjacent to the site, and probably the homeowner closest to the site, I couldn't agree more with Alderman Taylor. The former Wadsworth school is only available BECAUSE the city has not honored ANY of the promises and assurances made to the community since the school was vacated. The work began with a \"Daley-esque Meigs Field\" attempt to get the conversion well underway before notifying anyone, BECAUSE they knew it was wrong and intentionally so. Because I personally use the fields and greenspace and have personally removed glass, bottles, and even dead animal carcasses WHEN THE CITY NEGLECTED IT FOR YEARS ON END, I claim the right to have a say.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "(Left to right) Andre Smith Luis Cardona\u00a0block a bus transporting migrants to the temporary shelter at the former Wadsworth elementary school building,\u00a06420 S. University Ave., on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.(Left to right) Andre Smith Luis Cardona\u00a0block a bus transporting migrants to the temporary shelter at the former Wadsworth elementary school building,\u00a06420 S. University Ave., on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2023.The city has begun moving hundreds of migrants into the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn Thursday morning amidst continued resistance from some residents.Early in the morning on Feb. 2, a city bus arrived carrying about a dozen migrants to the temporary shelter at 6420 S. University Ave. Around noon, a second bus arrived but its path to the school was soon blocked by two male residents.\u00a0Wearing a bright yellow jacket, Andre Smith, who is running for 20th Ward alderman against incumbent Ald. Jeanette Taylor, and Luis Cardona, who lives in Woodlawn, stood in front of the bus for about an hour in protest of the city moving forward with the shelter despite opposition from the community.\u201cThis is a CTA bus. This is our tax dollars,\u201d said Smith as a dozen or so police officers looked on. \u201cWe (refuse) to move because the (city) did not work with the community, and we\u2019re not working with them.\u201dAs both men refused to budge, the bus driver reversed the vehicle down University Avenue and took an alternate route on Greenwood Avenue to another entrance.\u00a0According to a mayoral spokesperson Thursday afternoon, about \"100 men and women moved into Wadsworth. Due to capacity levels, these individuals were relocated from other facilities.\u201dAt a January community meeting about the shelter\u00a0with city officials, Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) Commissioner Brandie Knazze said the city plans to house about 250 men and women in the school for two years, after which the building will be turned back over to Chicago Public Schools.\u00a0Most of the repurposed school's inhabitants will be\u00a0Venezuelan asylum seekers, but it will also provide shelter to\u00a0unhoused local residents.Security contracted by the city will be on the premises 24/7, and an 11 p.m. curfew for those living at the shelter will be instituted. Chicago Police Department officers will also check the building frequently, paying \"special attention\" to the campus, according to\u00a0Roderick Watson, CPD's\u00a03rd District commander.The use of Wadsworth as a shelter is part of the city\u2019s response to the more than 5,100 migrants who have been bussed to Chicago from Texas and Colorado since August 2022. Another 1,500 people similarly seeking refugee or asylum status have also arrived to the city independently in that time.The city has so far set up 14 temporary housing accommodations in decommissioned libraries, vacant schools, churches and park facilities across the city. But new arrivals are coming every day, a spokesperson from\u00a0 the Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS), and the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.But plans for the shelter have been met with significant pushback from many Woodlawn residents. At the January community meeting, dozens of residents expressed exasperation to city officials at the project\u2019s moving ahead without community input and in a neighborhood many said the city has neglected for decades.Thursday's sudden move-in also comes after repeated delays of the shelter\u2019s opening and ongoing confusion from the city as to its plans. On Monday, a mayoral spokesperson told the Herald that the administration still had \"not determined a firm date on when this space will open for shelter for all those in need of support.\u201dOn Thursday, the mayoral spokesperson did not\u00a0answer additional questions from the Herald as to the shelter's\u00a0capacity, how long it will be used for and if there was communication from the city to residents regarding the move-in.Ald. Taylor issued a long statement that afternoon, noting Woodlawn's history as a home to Black Chicagoans displaced by gentrification and the complicated interactions between Black and Latino Chicagoans through the city's history. She said Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration has pitted the Black and Latino communities against each other again \"through their lack of transparency and unwillingness to address community demands.\"Taylor said she wants Woodlawn to get resources in light of the systemic racism it has experienced from the city in the past and for Chicago \"to be a real sanctuary for those in search of a better life.\"She also included a list of demands for the city in the statement, among them that 50% of hiring and contracting for the shelter to go to Woodlawn residents, businesses and organizations and for the Wadsworth building to be turned into a long-term community resource, alongside other community benefits.The Chicago Police Department\u2019s 3rd District weekly community meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at 10 a.m. at the South Side YMCA, 6330 S. Stony Island Ave. District Cmdr. Roderick Watson has scheduled another meeting for Feb. 16 to discuss the Wadsworth situation. Taylor\u2019s office is to have its own meeting on Feb. 16 as well.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Candidates for 5th Ward Alderman participate in a forum\u00a0at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023.ReporterCandidates for 5th Ward Alderman participate in a forum\u00a0at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 15, 2023.Fifth Ward aldermanic candidates have differing housing and development proposals, but the 10 who showed up to a Sunday, Jan. 15 forum agreed that trees in Jackson and South Shore Park should stop getting cut down.But much more of the debate at the forum, organized by the group Save Jackson Park and held at Hyde Park Union Church\u00a05600 S. Woodlawn Ave., focused on homeownership, protections for renters, reparations for Black residents and development.Economic development and housing affordability in the 5th Ward have long been concerns for constituents. But as investors buy more property around Jackson Park, especially in South Shore, gentrification worries have soared.Tina Hone, a former chief engagement officer for Mayor Lori Lightfoot, suggested that one means of combating displacement in South Shore is to make it easier for renters to become homeowners.\"The reason that people in South Shore are so vulnerable is because 77% of them are renters. The way that you free yourself from an unethical landlord is to not have to have a landlord,\" she said, suggesting more no-down-payment programs and more amenable mortgage-repayment programs.Down the forum\u2019s table, Gabriel Piemonte, a former Herald editor, countered that the solution to bad landlords isn't to buy a house: \"The solution to bad landlords is criminal prosecution, or maybe it's a civil suit. But one way or another, the problem is the landlord, not that you're a renter and you need to do better.\"He continued that economic development cannot happen without displacement and that policies should therefore be oriented around closing the racial wealth gap.That would include things like the South Side Community Federal Credit Union he helped found, and he suggested investing in financial cooperatives, perhaps by temporarily putting municipal funds in them to spur investment. He also called for a city-wide evictions moratorium, adding that it could be accomplished locally through \"individual interventions.\"Kris Levy, a South Shore wine and spirits distributor, and Hone both went on the attack against Piemonte, criticizing his outspoken support for reparations for Black Americans.Hone called reparations \"the ultimate economic enfranchisement,\" but questioned its feasibility. \"It's easy to say 'I'm going to fight for reparations.' Tell me how you're actually going to get there,\" she said. \"It's easy to say stuff, and it is way harder to talk about how you're actually going to get it done.\"She also accused Piemonte, who is white, of trying to \u201cout-Black everybody Black.\u201dRenita Q. Ward, an attorney, defended Piemonte, saying, \"If we look at the redistribution of wealth and we take into account systematic racism in this country, it is most-appropriate that Mr. Piemonte be the first and foremost to be talking about reparations and the redistribution of wealth from those that it was taken from.\"Ward went on to say that the panel's discussions around wages, affordable housing and small business support are \"all conversations that talk about putting liquid assets in the hands of people who need them the most\" and that the next alderperson would have to realize that support into reality.Other candidates stuck to their own backgrounds and platforms.Adrienne Irmer, a commissioner of the South Shore Special Service Area, said her first priority in office would be to foster inter-ward dialogue with other alderpersons whose wards cover specific community areas; she noted that Hyde Park and South Shore will be covered by three wards and that six wards divide Englewood.\"That is how you divide and dilute the power of a community and bleed it of resources, and leave it vulnerable to real estate speculators to fundamentally change the fabric of that community,\" she said. She proposed creating a comprehensive development plan for South Shore with the alderpersons of the 7th and 8th wards alongside similar plans for Greater Grand Crossing and Woodlawn.Desmon Yancy, a South Shore police accountability activist, noted that renters and homeowners alike deal with bad banks, unethical developers and house-flippers.He suggested that there be pathways to ownership through things like low-interest loans and mortgage assistance, alongside ordinances that prevent landlords from evicting tenants for any reason besides nonpayment of rent. He also suggested working with community-development corporations that do things like buy vacant properties for people to develop.Yancy also pointed to his past minimum wage activism and said he supports a $25 minimum wage and an increase for tipped workers' wages, saying, \"We can increase the money that people are bringing home so that there is more money at the end of the month than there is month.\" He also supports employer tax credits for hiring formerly incarcerated people.Levy said South Shore needs rent and property tax protections for its renters and homeowners as well as long-term subsidies to prevent eviction or mortgages. He also wants a trade school and business corridor in the neighborhood. He also advocated for the Obama Foundation to sign a community benefits agreement (CBA) for South Shore.Hone said every community in the ward has opportunities; in South Shore, she said \"on-the-precipice\" 71st Street needs parking. She proposed enlisting recently out-of-incarceration people to clean streets early in the morning, saying, \"You can't build a destination if it's filthy, and 71st Street right now is filthy.\"Wallace Goode, former head of the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, called for a comprehensive \"Marshall Plan\" for the ward targeting all affordable housing, violence and the wealth gap at once. He noted that his campaign is based around economic development, education, the environment, youth engagement, health care access and criminally targeting of gun-runners.Marlene Fisher, a cybersecurity administrator, said people should be asked why they do not want to become homeowners and that Section 8 voucher-holders should be made to take financial literacy programs and housing simulations as a requirement of the program.She recalled realizing as a tenant that her $800 rent was akin to a mortgage payment. So she sacrificed: \"Sometimes, you've just got to pull up our pants and do it. We've got to go without. We've got to save our money, build our credit so that we can afford to buy houses. I'm not going to make excuses; everyone can do it.\"Jocelyn Hare, who works for the U. of C.\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy, said her experience as \"a mixed-race queer girl\" made her \"understand what it's like to be unseen, be unheard, to be exposed to violence and trauma at a very young age without the support and resources I needed.\"\"Too many folks feel this way. You need somebody who understands these impacts,\" she said.And Dee Perkins, a corporate tax auditor, said she is already a community resource for people who need public and private social assistance. \"I'm not a community activist; people just feel comfortable with me, and they know that I get things done,\" she said.Candidates Joshua Gray and Robert Palmer did not attend.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Dorchester Ave.The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015Woodlawn residents gather for a\u00a0heated meeting with city officials about the Wadsworth migrant shelter on Thursday night, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015After several delays of the city\u2019s plan to house migrants in a repurposed Woodlawn school, hundreds of residents gathered for a community meeting last week to voice their frustrations and demand answers from officials.During a heated two-and-a-half hour meeting Thursday night, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave., city officials presented their latest plan for housing migrants, most of which are Venezuelan asylum seekers, at the vacant Wadsworth Elementary School, 6420 S. University Ave.These plans were met with significant pushback from residents, who later in the evening took to the microphone \u2014 or raised their voices from the crowd \u2014 to express exasperation at the project\u2019s moving ahead without community input and in a neighborhood many said the city has neglected for decades.\u201cThis is beautiful, to go in and create a shelter for people \u2026 But what about the people who have been here for the last 20 years?\u201d said Keith White, a 25-year resident of Woodlawn. \u201cWhy is it just now that (Wadsworth) is being fixed up?\u201dAs of now, the city plans to start moving about 250 men and women into the school starting the week of Jan. 23. The school will be used for about two years, after which the building will be turned back over to Chicago Public Schools. There will also be a \u201cprogressive increase\u201d of individuals housed at the shelter; the city does not yet have an official capacity limit.(When the city first proposed this plan in late October, 20th Ward Alderman Jeanette Taylor \u2014 whose ward includes the shelter \u2014 reported that she was informed that the city was working to repair the building to provide accommodations to upwards of 500 people.)Security contracted by the city will be on the premises 24/7, and an 11 p.m. curfew for those living at the shelter will instituted. Chicago Police Department officers will also check the building frequently, paying \"special attention\" to the campus, according to\u00a0Roderick Watson, CPD's\u00a03rd District commander.He added that the campus\u2019 parks and walking paths will remain open to the public and security cameras will be installed around the school\u2019s vicinity.As for supports, health care and mental health services, english classes and connections to support networks \u2014 such as faith-based organizations \u2014 will be provided to the asylum seekers by the city. Case management services will also be provided daily on site.\u201cShelter is not the last step on the journey, we want people to go out into (other) housing, so we\u2019re helping them work through that next step,\u201d said Brandie Knazze, the commissioner for Chicago\u2019s Department of Family and Support Services.Since Aug. 31, more than 5,100 people have arrived in Chicago from Texas, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) buses migrants out of state in protest of federal immigration policies. Some asylum seekers have also begun arriving on busses from Colorado and another 1,500 have arrived independently.The city has so far set up 14 temporary housing accommodations in decommissioned libraries, vacant schools, churches and park facilities across the city. But new arrivals are coming every day, Knazze said, and the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.Plans for the Wadsworth shelter have been delayed several times since first announced in mid-October, when Ald. Taylor was informed that CPS spent $1.5 million on plumbing, heating and other rehab work at Wadsworth. On Oct. 25, the mayor\u2019s office announced that there were \u201cno plans\u201d to use Wadsworth as a temporary shelter. Months later, on Dec. 28, Taylor reported being \u201cblindsided\u201d at a community meeting the city held in Woodlawn, where the mayor\u2019s office once again said it was planning to use Wadsworth as a shelter; she requested more meetings to take place before people moved in. On Jan. 6, the mayor\u2019s office announced that plans were once again delayed.Over the last few months, many residents at Thursday\u2019s meeting said, the city was not transparent about its plans nor did it seek community input.\u201cI know we didn\u2019t get the ask right the first time before we came before you, and for that I am truly sorry,\u201d said Knazze. \u201cThat oversight was a huge mistake.\u201dBut many weren\u2019t satisfied with just an apology and questioned the point of the meeting.\u201cNothing I say here tonight is going to change anything, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said White.Taylor spoke briefly at the beginning of the meeting, reminding the audience that: \u201cit is not about \u2018(migrants) versus us,\u2019 because at the end of the day the system is mistreating all of us,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cThis is about making sure that this situation that is being pushed upon us is safe for everybody.\u201dAt the end of the meeting, she took to the podium again. \u201cFolks do not want this in the community \u2026 and this conversation is not over,\u201d she said. \u201cTo Mayor Lori Lightfoot, y\u2019all are going to learn to listen.\u201dYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Jeanette Taylor (20th) are blaming Mayor Lori Lightfoot for \u201cchaos and division\u201d resulting from her plan to house hundreds of migrants at the former Wadsworth Elementary School in Woodlawn.They held a press conference outside the building, 6420 S. University Ave., on Sunday, Jan. 8, with Alds. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th) and Andre Vasquez (40th) of Pilsen and Ravenswood, respectively.\u201cLori Lightfoot\u2019s latest maneuver proves that she\u2019s incapable of bringing this city together,\u201d said Buckner, who is running for mayor, in a statement. \u201cHer latest decision, executed without a thoughtful and collaborative plan, caused chaos and pitted communities against each other, while she sat back silent and unaffected.\u201dPeters, in a statement, said, \u201cHistorically our city leaders have made decisions that intentionally pit Black and Latinx residents against each other, and the way Mayor Lightfoot has approached this process has contributed to that.\u201cRather than making each community feel respected and valued and lifting them up together, Lori Lightfoot\u2019s \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach has been one of divide and conquer instead of unite and prosper. We must be bold and fight segregation and not play games with people's lives.\u201dSaid Taylor, \u201cMayor Lightfoot\u2019s approach has been the same from day one, despite being called out for it. She thinks she knows best and that everyone else is wrong, against her, or both. If she had valued community input, together we could have found a solution that worked for everyone.\u201dSigcho-Lopez, for his part, criticized U.S. Rep. Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-4th) another mayoral candidate, for being \"silent\" on the issue.\u201cMayor Lightfoot and Chuy Garc\u00eda have offered no leadership and they haven\u2019t prioritized working with the federal government to help the asylum seekers make their home in Chicago.\u201d he said in a statement.The elected official\u2019s press conference comes on the heels of a Jan. 5 protest held by 20th Ward aldermanic candidate Jennifer Maddox, in which several speakers asked Lightfoot to withdraw her decision to house migrants in Woodlawn.A meeting with Ald. Taylor and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 12, at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Just before the League of Women Voters Chicago 5th Ward aldermanic forum at Montgomery Place, 5550 S. Shore Drive, Sunday, Jan. 8ReporterJust before the League of Women Voters Chicago 5th Ward aldermanic forum at Montgomery Place, 5550 S.

Shore Drive.All candidates support the municipal landmarking of Promontory Point and reestablishment of the Chicago Department of the Environment. All but one said they support \"streamlining city and county public transportation agencies\"; Dee Perkins said she was unsure about the issue, pending information from the agencies.Marlene Fisher: A cybersecurity administrator, she noted the construction of housing in Woodlawn with 30% affordability set-asides and the number of empty lots where housing could be built.

Said the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS) should be reimagined.Jocelyn Hare: Longtime Hyde Park and neighborhood homeowner; said closing small businesses and rising rents motivated her 2015 run against Hairston. Concerned about prices for tenants and homeowners rising because of the OPC, which she said should be addressed with \"resources.\" Wants to focus on supporting small businesses as well as fostering local entrepreneurship through job incubators. Proposes establishing a ward council to vote on positions related to local issues. Wants to engage the community for its opinion on public schools and to visit local schools.Tina Hone: Said her commitment to civil rights, social justice and equity stems from her lived experience as a biracial person.

Kwame Raoul's (D-13th) staff. Currently a member of South Shore's special service area (SSA) and directed money to the neighborhood's commercial corridors. Said the OPC\u2019s diverse hiring and contracting bodes well for future economic development once the center opens and that corresponding economic development and preparation for local small businesses should be going on now. Would allocate TIF money to benefit local entrepreneurship and to help fund CBA-bound developments. Said she would \"amplify\" the policies of the coming Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability and elected police district councils and do oversight over police hiring in order to have officers that reflect district demographics. Would attend LSC meetings and forge relationships with representatives. Would support CPS school board candidates with support from residents and teachers, not those \"supported by corporations\" who support charter schools.Kris Levy: A wine-and-spirits company sales coordinator, native South Sider and 15-year Jackson Park Highlands resident, he said his private sector management skills would benefit the ward; public safety, economic development and community services are his top issues. Concerned about current ward residents benefitting from OPC. Would decide how to spend ward TIF money with community involvement, in light of often-competing affected local interests. Wants more youth programming in neighborhoods. Wants more police foot patrols and to target loitering in local businesses.Robert Palmer: The special education/diverse learners teacher, Special Olympics and baseball coach, and Chicago Teachers Union member said ward residents are tired of not receiving adequate city services or effective communication with the government, largely depending on what area the residents live in.

She wants to have a \"community-peer patrol team,\" ward-wide WiFi, a website for ward residents, protections for seniors, youth engagement and the encouragement of entrepreneurship and local development. She is a corporate tax auditor and professional boxer. Wants more transparency for TIF funds and the use of those funds for homeowners to buy vacant properties to rehabilitate them. Her patrol team would consist of volunteers and employees, tasked with being present in the community to prevent crime. Said charter schools that receive public funding \"should be treated like public schools.\u201dGabriel Piemonte: The former Herald editor who ran against Hairston in 2019 wants discussions of public safety to include discussions of employment and housing insecurity, noting high evictions and the high homicide rate in South Shore. He would focus on Black Chicagoans' housing crisis in terms of eviction, foreclosure and high property tax assessments. Wants a more accountable CPD, in light of its annually increasing budget and relatively low rates of solving criminal incidents. Said the Obama Foundation \"has never felt like they have to listen to us\" and that the OPC should never have been built in Jackson Park. Concerned about diverse-hiring practices at the construction site, particularly the number of African Americans working there. Complained about the deteriorated Stony Island Avenue bus line service because of construction. Called charter schools \"a disaster for the public school system\" that should be systematically dismantled, with exceptions for those \"that are working now.\" Called the CPS appropriations system \"a disaster\" and wants to abolish TIFs.Renita Ward: A U. of C. Divinity School graduate and attorney for Northwestern Medicine, she said her professional background would enable her to perform an alderperson's myriad duties. Is focusing on youth, economic development, education and responsive, efficient government for the ward. Said OPC-related transportation development will depend on the aldermanic office and community being good partners while holding the Obama Foundation accountable. She would garner feedback from communities recognized to have been affected by systemic racism to see what policies and resources they need. Wants a tighter strategic partnership with the CPD, the U. of C. Police Department, local block clubs and community organizations. Cautioned against closing charter schools to which enrolled students may be attached.Desmon Yancy: The labor and community organizer and policy advocate was part of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) coalition that mobilized to pass a significant police accountability ordinance in City Council in July 2021. Said he is running out of concern for Black Chicago's future. Wants city capital for Black-owned small businesses and city resources like tax credits or job-training programs for formerly incarcerated people. Would work with the forming community commission and police district councils, established by that 2021 ordinance, to foster better police-community relations. Disappointed, as a South Shore resident, about the closure of Cornell Drive and thinks the Obama Foundation has not been communicative about the OPC's effect on transportation; supports \"much more robust\" community engagement thereof, instituted by the aldermanic office. As a former schoolteacher, he is against charter schools and said adequately funding CPS would negate their need.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

The city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201d He is seen above next to the former Pioneer Bank at North Avenue and Pulaski Road, a site for city redevelopment.Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who oversees a revitalization effort there, criticized the relatively limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have received much more.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades.\u201d\u00a0Amalia Nieto Gomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, says: \u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Bill Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez, a community organizer who took part in the city's Invest South/West planning process, called it \"a facade, it's a veneer. The city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201d He is seen above next to the former Pioneer Bank at North Avenue and Pulaski Road, a site for city redevelopment.This story was originally published by the Illinois Answers Project.When Joyce Brown was told the Invest South/West program was coming to her South Shore neighborhood, she and other residents did just what city officials told them to do \u2014\u00a0they started making their wish lists.Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s highly touted program plans to spend $750 million citywide in neighborhoods starved for investment and development, and Brown hoped some of that money could build up the community where she has lived for nearly 40 years. A grocery store here. A dry cleaner there. A new bakery for residents.\u00a0Instead, Brown says after numerous back-and-forth debates during community meetings with city officials, her South Side community is getting housing it didn\u2019t ask for.\u201cWe were told [the city] can\u2019t build those things until people come,\u201d Brown said about her suggestions. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is preserve my community.\u201dWhen the mayor unveiled the program just months into her term, she extolled the initiative as the city\u2019s best effort to bring public and private investment and development to 10 neighborhoods that have received little of it in recent decades.\u00a0Lightfoot promised a collaborative, \u201ccommunity-based planning and development strategy that will ensure equitable investment in the South and West sides.\u201d\u00a0Without it, South Shore and the other nine community areas would likely continue to go without major developments.Many residents have praised Invest South/West\u2019s goals of revitalizing long-neglected Chicago neighborhoods. The initiative has given hope to neighborhoods and energized them, they say.\u00a0But interviews by the Illinois Answers Project with almost two dozen stakeholders and community groups reveal a common thread of complaints. While the city vowed to involve locals, residents say they\u2019ve felt shut out of any real decision-making.In a process that was supposed to be transparent, it\u2019s often unclear, residents say, how the city selects winning projects. Even some alderpersons say they\u2019ve been left in the dark.\u00a0Stakeholders worry that winning developments are often about dollars and cents \u2014\u00a0what is the most financially viable with the least cost to the city \u2014\u00a0while neglecting the community\u2019s wishes. Despite assurances from the city that it wants to bring in new, smaller developers to the table, some of those firms say they\u2019ve lost out to the familiar, bigger players who appear favored by the city.Community stakeholders in at least four Invest South/West target neighborhoods said city officials overrode their requests and chose anchor developments that didn\u2019t have strong community backing.In South Shore, the long-neglected intersection at 79th Street and Exchange Avenue will become home to a $47.3 million project including housing, retail and a museum space to be built by a team including the Chicago developer responsible for Englewood\u2019s Whole Foods, now shuttered.In Auburn Gresham, some residents criticized city officials after Lightfoot announced the selection of a $43 million affordable housing development in early 2022, despite a wave of requests for commercial businesses.\u00a0\u00a0On the West Side, Austin community groups flagged a selection process they called unfair to neighborhood-based developers. Ultimately, the city chose a $37.5 million project to renovate the former Laramie Bank to include a blues museum, bank branch, caf\u00e9 and business incubator.\u00a0And for one Humboldt Park site, the city broke a tie between two proposals, choosing what one resident called a \u201cvague\u201d plan for a $53.9 million rehabilitation of the former landmark Pioneer Bank.Those stakeholders and others said the goals of Lightfoot\u2019s plan are on target, but the execution diminished their optimism about its outcome.\u201cA lot of people ended up saying, \u2018At least we\u2019re getting something.\u2019 But why promise people things then do what you want to do anyway?\u201d Brown asked.Many of the details of how the city picked winners and losers remain unclear.\u00a0The city has refused to release many documents related to the program, including such basic information as detailed responses from developers, the top three plans for each site and even who sat on most of the selection committees. The Better Government Association, the publisher of the Illinois Answers Project, is suing the city to obtain those records after the city denied or ignored Freedom of Information Act requests for them.Peter Strazzabosco, a spokesman for the city\u2019s planning department, said it \u201cvalues all public\u00a0comments and suggestions during RFP [requests for proposal] development and review\u201d and other suggestions from residents are \u201cbeing fulfilled\u201d through city grant programs.\u00a0Ultimately, some requests aren\u2019t reflected in final projects because of concerns surrounding financial viability, he said.\u00a0\u201cSome neighborhood goals, depending on the area, are not feasible during this phase of Invest South/West due to local market conditions that preclude private-sector participation,\u201d Strazzabosco said in a written statement. \u201cInvest South/West is intended to improve local market conditions so all neighborhoods enjoy similar private and public amenities.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The city announced Invest South/West in October 2019 and held kickoff celebrations featuring fanfare starting in December.\u00a0The celebrations drew alderpersons, organizers and community members enthusiastic about having the chance to sit at the table with city planning officials, rather than \u201chaving the city come down\u2026 and tell communities \u2018we're doing this for you, and we're doing it this way,\u2019\u201d which Lightfoot described as \u201cthe wrong way to do anything\u201d at the one-year celebration of the program in October 2020.Residents were excited to tell the city what they envisioned for blighted business corridors in their neighborhoods, completing surveys and needs assessments provided by the city.\u00a0Some residents, like Brown, showed up not just with community wish lists but with corridor studies and existing quality of life plans \u2014 to show they\u2019d already done their homework and knew their communities\u2019 needs.The city convened roundtable processes, led by officials from the Department of Planning and Development and other city departments, to \u201censure the neighborhood voices are heard and integrated into the priorities\u201d of the initiative and hear feedback, according to the city.\u00a0In the months following the mayor\u2019s announcement, Planning and Development Commissioner Maurice Cox publiclyechoed the idea that existing community plans would be the cornerstone of Invest South/West developments.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t believe in top-down planning,\u201d Cox told Curbed Chicago in December 2019. \u201cPeople cannot come from the outside and tell a community what to do.\u201dEarly on in the community roundtable process, the city said it had three main evaluation criteria for Invest South/West proposals, focusing on building community wealth, \u201cprofessional competence\u201d of developers \u2014 a category that includes responding to community priorities, design excellence as well as innovation and creativity \u2014 and the economic feasibility of the potential project.\u00a0Beyond those criteria, the city has provided little additional details.As Lightfoot announced winning project bids, residents say they saw no scorecards, no breakdowns of ownership or equity structure for the winning developer and project, and there was scant explanation as to why the winner was selected.\u201cThe roundtables are a start at engagement, but if all we're doing is presenting to a table of folks but there\u2019s no involvement in the decision-making and no explanation then it's falling short,\u201d said Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who runs a neighborhood revitalization effort there.Bernard Loyd, a longtime Bronzeville resident who oversees a revitalization effort there, criticized the relatively limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have received much more.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades.\u201d\u00a0DPD first activated the initiative in three neighborhoods. In August 2020, the city released requests for proposals for project sites in Auburn Gresham, Englewood and Austin, and the process that followed was contentious.\u00a0In Auburn Gresham, community residents pushed back on an affordable-housing development initially selected by a committee that critics said did not represent neighborhood voices.Ald. David Moore (17th) held an emergency meeting where attendees scolded city officials, saying they needed to worry less about bringing new people to Auburn Gresham and more about keeping business in the neighborhood.Moore told Illinois Answers that roundtable meetings with DPD mainly included neighborhood groups with existing ties to City Hall, and residents may feel left out because city officials \u201cdon\u2019t want so many voices in this meeting that [they] don\u2019t get any progress.\u201dBut according to Moore, the neighborhood campaign challenging a low-income housing plan was \u201cdetrimental\u201d to community support for a plan that he ultimately thinks will provide more sustainable housing options for residents in his ward.\u00a0Janetta Pegues, an active resident of the Englewood community who attended Auburn Gresham\u2019s roundtable meetings, said she was frustrated that more moderate voices weren\u2019t amplified to \u201ccounter those who were insistent on pushing this narrative that really wasn't reflective of the whole community.\u201d\u00a0The $43 million development, spearheaded by the Imagine Group and Evergreen Development, broke ground in August.\u00a0Strazzabosco said in Auburn Gresham alone there were 30 community meetings on the request for Invest South/West project plans.\u00a0To address community concerns about \u201cpotential over-development\u201d of the initial location, a second site was added to provide additional public amenities and the city is offering incentives to help reopen a Save A Lot grocer \u2014 a response to community input, he said in a written statement.In Englewood, a coalition of community organizations, dissatisfied with city plans, partnered with Ald. Stephanie Coleman\u2019s 16th Ward office to strategize how to fund and support existing development concepts in the community.\u00a0Asiaha Butler, co-founder and CEO of Englewood\u2019s resident association, R.A.G.E, said Coleman\u2019s process has been more inclusive than the city\u2019s which \u201cdoesn't feel like a roundtable, it\u2019s a table where the city is just throwing out information.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it just from working in Englewood \u2014 [the Department of Planning and Development] just operates as its own entity with developers, sometimes with aldermen, sometimes with communities, sometimes not \u2026 they work with who they need to work with \u2014 whether that be the community or not,\u201d Butler told Illinois Answers.On the city\u2019s West Side, longtime organizers like Jackie Reed, former CEO of the Westside Health Authority, say that Lightfoot\u2019s and Cox\u2019s approach excluded residents and community groups in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0The Austin-based development organization Reed is involved with bid on the Invest South/West site at West Chicago and North Laramie Avenues but lost and protested for months after the winning proposal was announced.\u201cThey act like they have community support but they have not had that support,\u201d Reed said.Of the 21 members of\u00a0 selection committee that awarded the Laramie State Bank site to Heartland Housing and Oak Park Regional Housing Center, all but one were city employees at the time, according to city records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.The city denied a request for similar records for the other Invest South/West neighborhoods. In a written statement, a spokesman for the planning department said three \u201ccommunity-based evaluators\u201d were part of subsequent project proposal review processes after the first three sites were chosen.\u00a0Athena Williams, head of the Oak Park Regional Housing Center, said when the request for proposals was first released she went to groups, including Westside Health Authority, to form a partnership.\u00a0That group told her they didn\u2019t need partners for their bid and ultimately Heartland Housing was the only group that wanted to partner on a proposal.She didn\u2019t hear a lot of pushback on the submitted plan and she \u201ctalked to a lot of individuals.\u201d Williams said she\u2019s urged Heartland to do community meetings to hear from residents and ensure the project continues to address what\u2019s needed most. Despite complaints, she\u2019s excited for what the project could provide to the community.\u201cThis is stellar \u2014 this is unseen support that should have happened many administrations ago,\u201d Williams said of Invest South/West. \u201cAt this point, the fact that my project has received roughly $39 million from the city \u2013 the West Side has not seen that during my existence. Let\u2019s celebrate that.\u201dAld. Emma Mitts (37th) told Illinois Answers that she initially thought she\u2019d have more leverage in selecting a winning bidder for the Austin project but was not made privy to the city\u2019s decision-making process. Mitts said COVID-era restrictions made for a rocky start to the city\u2019s engagement efforts but hoped things could now improve.\u00a0After the first round of requests for plans was released, the city changed its model for engagement to include a community resident on the committee responsible for selecting the winning project.Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, said the process in her community is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d Her organization has teamed up with others to comment on the city\u2019s new master city plan, especially as it concerns developments.\u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done,\u201d Nieto Gomez said.Amalia Nieto Gomez, executive director of Alliance of the SouthEast, says: \u201cMy thing is, it\u2019s great that the investment is here, but at the same time, considering the scale of it, more needs to be done.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Others who spoke on the condition of anonymity said engagement efforts were often one-size-fits all and failed to meet the unique needs of each community.Some community meetings lacked Spanish translators. The city at times did little outreach beyond sending emails to established groups. Seniors received limited technical assistance to complete online surveys that were often their only chance to provide feedback.Strazzabosco said the organization that provides the city\u2019s private translation service has \u201cbeen unreliable for certain events, due to staffing issues,\u201d but officials are working to \u201censure these meetings have the relevant translation available.\u201dBeyond the community meetings and publishing the requests for proposals, the city emailed residents who expressed interest in participating, hosted other meetings related to the Invest South/West project \u201cupon request and through sister agencies\u201d and summarized milestone and spending information in annual reports in its efforts toward transparency, Strazzabosco said.Some involved in the evaluation process question whether proposals that don\u2019t excel in a category focused on putting money back into the community but ask for the lowest amount of city financing get preferential treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Shaka Rawls, principal of Leo Catholic High School in Auburn Gresham, said when the city invited him to participate in discussions about things like youth centers, local retail and sit-down restaurants, he expected that input to be reflected when a winning development was announced.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat is not what happened,\u201d he told Illinois Answers. \u201cIt\u2019s a funding issue. Now it\u2019s \u2018how do we fit this round peg in a square hole?\u2019\u201dCity-backed projects are often harder for smaller developers to secure because they have to ask for more financial support.\u00a0Christyn Freemon, a consultant to a development team that lost out on one project, says as long as city departments like planning and others consider that a weakness of these proposals, community-based developers will continue to be left out.\u201cThe process is not as inclusive or equitable for smaller developers,\u201d Freemon said. \u201cIf we're talking equity the city should be willing to make a bigger investment in a place that it has disinvested in for years.\u201dIn response to criticism that small developers were not a bigger part of Invest South/West, Strazzabosco said in a written statement projects that \u201cmay have addressed community needs but were otherwise non-viable\u201d were not selected.\u00a0\u201cA primary goal of Invest South/West is to support minority and emerging development entities that reflect the communities in which they are building,\u201d Strazzabosco said.Many Invest South/West sites feature familiar developers who have worked on some of the largest or more prominent projects in the city, despite the city\u2019s promise to cast a wider net.In Humboldt Park, the city chose two business corridors \u2014 one on North Avenue and another on nearby Chicago Avenue \u2014 for development.\u00a0That meant two roundtable processes for community members to pick a site and creating \u201ca community-driven survey \u2026 to see what the community wanted,\u201d said William Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez, who participated in the North Avenue committee.Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said the planning department\u2019s request for proposal release marked a change in the community\u2019s relationship with the city.There were two main bids the selection committee considered, he said. One hit all the bullet points of the RFP the community worked together to create, while the other was \u201cvery vague \u2026 but asked for less [tax increment financing] money.\u201dThe two proposals received nearly the same score from the evaluation team, records shared with Illinois Answers show.\u00a0Ultimately, the department of planning awarded the North Avenue project to Park Row Development, All Construction Group and JGMA. That group \u201cdidn't really know the community and didn't really do much to engage with the community\u201d prior to submitting the bid, Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said.Engagement was limited to mostly communicating with Ald. Roberto Maldonado (26th) and a representative from the Puerto Rican Cultural Center rather than with the community at large, Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. Neither JGMA nor Maldonado responded to requests for comment.\u201cInvest South/West is a facade, it's a veneer,\u201d Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe city talks about engaging communities, but they drag you along and then do what they want in the end.\u201dJGMA, along with Park Row Development and All Construction Group, will create the Team Pioneros project, a $53.9 million planned rehabilitation of the vacant Pioneer Bank, filling it with an entrepreneurial incubator space, Latino cultural center, and office space for JGMA, according to the city.JGMA has developed the Chinatown branch library and the Humboldt Park Wellness Center. The group was recently chosen to develop the city\u2019s casino.\u00a0Another site north of the bank will also be redeveloped to include 75 affordable residential units, offices for Humboldt Park Family Health and a potential library branch, according to the city.Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the process and its outcome, in the end.\u201cThat\u2019s my critique of Invest South/West,\u201d Smiljanic-P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThe city tries to be about equity, but, when you push them on that, you realize what they really want to see is growth and sites that make money versus the community groups pushing for things that are better for their communities.\u201dIn North Lawndale, the city selected as the developer Related Midwest \u2014 known for luxury apartments and condos as well as for building the city\u2019s $7 billion \u201cnewest neighborhood\u201d the 78 \u2014 to develop a site with 548 Development, an MBE-certified \u201cup-and-comer\u201d in the city\u2019s development world, Cox told the Chicago Sun-Times.That 20.8 acre development will include two community centers and public, open space featuring art and a solar-powered industrial complex, according to the city.A plan for another site in the neighborhood, which will be a collaboration between GRE Ventures, Imagine Group and 548 Development, features 60 mixed-income apartments, three market-rate townhomes, as well as retail and restaurant space, and a community center.Imagine Group is part of the development team on the Invest South/West Auburn Gresham apartments planned for Moore\u2019s ward.KMW Communities and LG Development, in a $19.2 million joint venture, will develop a project chosen for Bronzeville\u2019s business corridor, called The Legacy District, along with Bronzeville Community Partners, according to the city.\u00a0That project on a city-owned corner of 47th Street and Vincennes Avenue is slated to include 12,000 square feet of commercial space and 25 mixed-income residential units. The project is slated to create 174 permanent jobs and 140 construction jobs.KMW and LG are likely best known for their home and apartment developments. KMW submitted the winning proposal to build The Ave. on West Chicago Avenue in Humboldt Park.DL3 realty, which developed the now closed Whole Foods in Englewood, was chosen to develop the Thrive Exchange project in South Shore along with Revere Properties and Claretian.\u00a0\u201cIt seems to be the same developers, it\u2019s always the same big dogs, it\u2019s never the little developers in the city,\u201d Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to the people, we don\u2019t try to spread the wealth in the city \u2026 they don\u2019t really value what the people in the community think.Taylor said the city\u2019s approach to Invest South/West \u201cexposes that we\u2019re not as transparent and not as community friendly as we should be.\u201dAld. Pat Dowell (3rd) said the city and developers on the Legacy District project have \u201cdone very little to engage the community\u201d or her office on the anchor development coming to her ward.\u00a0While she likes that the city has tried to engage the community through the roundtable process, she remains concerned about delays.\u201cThe Invest South/West concept is good, what it's trying to achieve is needed on the South and West sides, but at least in my community it's been short on results,\u201d Dowell said.The initiative has been slow throughout the 10 communities chosen for development, as reported by Crain\u2019s Chicago. The first of the flagship developments, in Auburn Gresham, didn\u2019t break ground until last August.\u00a0Despite the slow start, Lightfoot\u2019s mayoral campaign featured a clip of her and others in an ad breaking ground at that development among others as part of her push to convince city residents she deserves another term.For most people active in the 10 communities targeted by Invest South/West, this isn't the first time hearing political promises of revitalized city-owned lots and revamped business corridors \u2013 what have been an eyesore for longtime residents who once knew those areas as thriving hubs.\u00a0While the mayor\u2019s initiative is still in its early stages, the work and plans to bring business back are decades old. Some who spoke with Illinois Answers say their frustration with city officials has only been exacerbated by Invest South/West \u2013 seeing a missed opportunity to not just offer a place in the conversation but also in the decision-making.\u00a0A South Shore resident since 1989, Jacquie Jakes-Johnson said she's attended every meeting for the Invest South/West project coming to her neighborhood and was invited by Ald. Greg Mitchell to join the committee overseeing the Thrive Exchange project earlier this year. The roundtable hasn't met since September, she said.She said there's a \"50/50 split between people who are excited ... who believe in this development\" and others who \"say we get promised these things and funding is always yanked back.\"DL3 Realty, which will build the Thrive Exchange, revised its proposal and added a bodega to the plan, signaling to Jakes-Johnson that the company did listen to the community.Mitchell is working on bringing a grocery store to the area and the condos that are slated to be built will \"bring in more people with disposable income, and you need that in order to bring in more of the things residents need in South Shore,\u201d Jakes-Johnson said.But when she thinks of the funding available through Invest South/West, Jakes-Johnson questions whether it\u2019s fair.\u201cWhen I think about the limited amount of funding, especially for South Shore, it's not equitable because other areas do receive what appears to be unlimited TIF-funding while we are barely scraping the barrel to get the necessities we need to thrive and keep going,\u201d Jakes-Johnson said.Loyd and others who spoke to Illinois Answers took issue with the limited pool of funds available for Invest South/West projects when other city-backed projects have gotten many more dollars.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re battling over nickels and dimes while other communities are getting $100 bills \u2014 and have been for decades,\u201d Loyd said.Craig Chico, the head of the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council which manages the corridor project for New City, said the reality is \u201c[the city] can't give everything to everyone, and some requests and desires aren't relevant to what this money can be used to do.\u201dThe city chose Chico\u2019s council as well as other community-based organizations to work with its agencies and local partners.\u00a0Each gets an $80,000-a-year contract over five years funded by tax increment financing dollars from the districts along each development corridor.Chico, whose family moved to Back of the Yards in the 1920s, an area that falls in the boundaries of New City, said he watched the commercial areas \u201ckind of die\u201d over the years as malls moved in but people, and other businesses, moved out.He\u2019s not an expert as to where the money \u201cis going and where it\u2019s coming from, but it\u2019s spotlighting areas that need it.\u201d\u201cWhen this corridor was dying and rotting and there were vacancies, no one paid attention to it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a priority,\u201d Chico said, adding that the neighborhood\u2019s project, called United Yards, is \u201cone of the key pillars to get people to stick around\u201d or come back to New City.Having that cornerstone will allow the city and community to \u201cfocus on other pieces like safety and economic development,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m hoping this can be more sustainable,\u201d Chico said. \u201cYou can't invest in one community at the expense of another. Not every community is going to be Sauganash, but all should have basic amenities for people to feel good about where they live. [This initiative] is more than just a financial investment, it's a life investment.\u201dMalcolm Crawford, corridor manager for the Austin area, said he believes city officials have \u201cthe right intentions and I think that change is coming.\u201dAlong with the redevelopment of the old Laramie Bank building, the city also plans to revamp adjacent land with a mixed-income, multi-story rental building that includes a green roof, public plaza, social spaces and outdoor art.Tucked between Oak Park and West Humboldt and Garfield Parks, disinvestment in the Austin community, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, made it a prime target for Lightfoot\u2019s effort.\u00a0But Crawford, who is the executive director of Austin African American Business Networking Association, said the mayor\u2019s attention has brought excitement to his West Side community.\u201cWe\u2019re [one of] the largest community [areas] in the city and for years we\u2019ve gotten the least resources and that\u2019s evidenced by what we\u2019ve seen for years,\u201d Crawford, a 20-year resident of the area, said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the potential of what can happen in the community and I believe something has to happen.\u201dThe winning project for Austin\u2019s Invest South/West corridor is a renovation of the Laramie Bank building and is expected to create 150 construction jobs and 22 full-time jobs.He brushed aside criticisms of the initiative as forcing communities to fight over a limited pool of funds or continuing the top-down development process that has plagued the city\u2019s neighborhood projects saying \u201csomething beats nothing.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never had the amount of a voice that we have now,\u201d Crawford said.\u00a0Loyd, the Bronzeville resident, said neighborhoods like his lack the resources to address the basic needs of residents.\u00a0He said the goal of the Invest South/West initiative is \u201cright on\u201d because communities need \u201cmuch more systematic\u201d levels of investment, but Bronzeville and others tagged for projects need even greater levels of investment for the program, and their neighborhoods, to succeed.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe fundamental issue of Invest South/West . . .\u00a0 is, until we can create vibrant communities of color, Chicago will never be truly successful.\u201dContributing: Emeline PosnerThis article first appeared on Illinois Answers Project and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015For the second time after reports of the imminent opening of the former Wadsworth Elementary, 6420 S. University Ave., for migrants, Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration says \"the city has not determined a firm date on when this space will open for shelter.\"\u201cAs a welcoming city, we are committed to receiving asylum seekers with dignity and respect. We have worked with county, state, local leaders and community-based partners to explore all options for temporary shelters to respond to the urgent needs of our new arrivals. The city is continuing to engage with the Woodlawn community and is committed to carefully balancing the needs of both our residents and new arrivals,\u201d spokesman Ryan Johnson said Friday in a statement.Senior communications officials in the mayoral administration have declined on-record interviews on the subject.The Texas government has sent thousands of migrants over the past months to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 so named because their local law enforcement departments do not enforce federal immigration laws \u2014 like Chicago, which has taken in nearly 4,000 migrants and asylum seekers in this way since August.A meeting with Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and city officials is planned for 6 p.m. Thursday at the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave.Jennifer Maddox, who is running against Taylor in the 20th Ward aldermanic election, organized a rally of about a dozen people on Thursday morning, Jan. 5, to protest the decision to house migrants in the old Wadsworth school.\u00a0\u201cWe are tired of being shut out and dumped on as residents in Woodlawn and the South Side,\u201d Maddox said in a statement.Taylor distanced herself from the protest, during which a speaker who declined to self-identify suggested that the migrants instead be housed in the majority-Latino Little Village neighborhood, the Chicago Tribune reported.\u201cThis type of localized nationalism does nothing to uplift working class communities of color and only feeds the worst of right wing politics,\u201d State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) said Thursday in a tweet about the protest.\u00a0But Taylor did articulate a sense of frustration that Woodlawn, with its decades-long problems around homelessness, blight and substandard delivery of social services, was being asked to host a facility she said it is ill-prepared for.\"What I want us to think about is, these folks have already been through a traumatic experience. We're going to take them another one without having the resources and real support for them?\" Taylor asked. \"The city has a responsibility to have sanctuary for everybody, for all. So I hear people on both sides, but this is not a time for us to pit Black and brown against each other.\"She noted the sprawling 20th Ward's Latino population, in Back of the Yards, as well as the solidarity among Latinos and African Americans in her days of activism against school closures. (She noted that Wadsworth was one of the public elementary schools the city closed in 2013, which she said \"traumatized\" the surrounding community.\")\"The thought that this country is just busing people to different states because they don't want to be bothered says something about this system, and we're just caught up in it in our emotions,\" Taylor said.The alderwoman wants residents and institutions of the area around the Wadsworth building to have input in the planning. She is also having a closed meeting on Monday with representatives of the Chicago Police Department and Chicago Public Schools as well as selected local stakeholders.\"People are watching this and seeing that I'm the sacrificial lamb for this, and what I say can make or break me, because either 'I'm not Black enough,' or 'I don't like migrants.' I'm being thrown under the bus either way.\" Taylor said. \"I get Black people's anger altogether, because I'm that person. If I'm nothing else, I'm a Black woman first. But that does not make me hate any group of people. That does not make me say 'don't take care of them.' We're caught up in this thing because the City of Chicago has not done its due diligence with its own homeless population.\"\"We cannot be fighting each other because of something that we're inheriting. Folks from El Paso are sending these buses to Chicago intentionally, but that does not mean we don't work together and come up with a plan that makes everybody safe and that everybody understands,\" she said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Kam Buckner debuts his new mayoral campaign headquarters at 5401 S. Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.Kam Buckner debuts his new mayoral campaign headquarters at 5401 S. Wentworth Ave. on Tuesday, August 30.In October, Chicago Police Department officer who had been investigated for affiliating with the white nationalist Proud Boys organization was found to have given false statements about it and given a 120-day suspension.A reporter subsequently asked Mayor Lori Lightfoot about why the department had not fired an officer affiliated with the far-right, anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic organization that participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the United States Capitol; Lightfoot said that characterization was overstated.Two years ago today a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to take down democracy. This mob included the Proud Boys \u2014 an extremist group Mayor Lightfoot excused in October when she said it was an \u2018overstatement\u2019 to call them anti-Semitic and anti-gay, and defended the Chicago Police Department\u2019s decision not to fire an officer with known links to the Proud Boys.Mayor Lightfoot cannot even say once what I\u2019ve said multiple times since that moment in October: Proud Boys have no place in our police department. Period.Public trust in the police is at an all-time low, and it\u2019s a slap in the face to every CPD officer dedicated to constitutional policing to have a mayor who defends Proud Boys\u2019 racism.There\u2019s a clear difference between Mayor Lightfoot and me: She defends the indefensible while I\u2019m inclined to action. But today is the perfect time for her to right her wrong and apologize for brushing off the very real danger of far-right extremists infiltrating the ranks of those who are meant to keep us safe.Buckner, a local state representative since 2019, is running for mayor.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "Desmon YancyReporterDesmon YancyOne of the public faces of the successful campaign to create an elected board for civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department, Desmon Yancy is running to be the next alderman of the 5th Ward.Yancy, who co-founded and is the spokesperson of the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) and the subsequent Empowering Communities for Public Safety (ECPS) coalitions, has long been involved in work around police accountability and public safety.\"We've still got a long way to go in a city that's had issues around policing on paper since the 1960s and, with this current consent decree and the failures of the city to meet these deadlines, it's clear that it's a big boat to turn around,\u201d said Yancy. \u201cBut I'm happy to do my part.\"Born in the 8th Ward and a 1989 graduate from Kenwood Academy, Yancy is the son of a Chicago policeman who worked on Harold Washington\u2019s mayoral campaign and a mother who did medical billing and was an active volunteer with their church. After spending a year at DeVry University, he worked in sales and served in AmeriCorps VISTA, as a teacher's assistant at Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St., in the mid-1990s. He said the experience showed him the difficulties schools face when they are not adequately funded.In 2007, he got into union organizing with SEIU Healthcare and eventually created a program there that taught labor leadership and organizing.\"The gist of it was really to make sure that union workers could go home to their communities and provide the same leadership,\" Yancy said. \"When you're thinking about the housing crisis, when banks abandoned homes in formerly great neighborhoods, or fighting to raise the minimum wage across the city, these leaders played often-key roles in organizing their own community outside of the union work.\"He worked with SEIU until 2013, leading canvassing teams with the union in support of both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns in Chicago, Northwest Indiana and Wisconsin. In 2014, he worked on a local voter registration project with 13 coalition partners, which he described as both challenging and \"a first taste of how important it is for organizations to work across the city in order to have change.\"Following the police murder and coverup of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in fall 2014, a coalition of community organizations came together to form Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability in 2016. Yancy was a co-founding member of the coalition, and would become its policy coordinator.Over the years GAPA, in partnership with groups like the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression (CAARPR), other public safety coalitions and community organizations, would push for the City Council to create a platform for civilian oversight of the police. In July 2021, City Council created the citywide Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability (CCPSA) and 22 district councils, elected for each of the city\u2019s police districts.\"A lot of it was 'slow and steady winning the race' and being true to your convictions, especially when we ran up against opposition from Mayor Lightfoot,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cShe was fully in support of our proposal for police oversight in Chicago and then at a point got cold feet, because she thought that district councils would have too much power\u2026 But we stayed true to what we felt was really a key principle of the work that we were doing, which was transparency and accountability.\u201dShould he be elected alderman, Yancy would like to push the city towards creating more policy accountability and oversight, which he said is still lacking even after the commission and councils' creation. He named outgoing Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th), Roderick Sawyer (6th) and Harry Osterman (48th) as well as Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) and North Side Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) as particularly hard workers behind the July 2021 measure. But Yancy said more needs to be done to support it behind the scenes.\"Like I said, I'm the son of a police officer, but at the same time I've been working on police accountability for the last six years,\u201d Yancy said. \u201cI certainly understand the work that needs to be done and look forward to being able to support that work on council.\"Lightfoot appointed seven interim commissioners in August; Yancy said he has been working with them to develop talking points about issues like the police budget. He said the interim CCPSA is looking to make an immediate impact. It will eventually play a role in hiring and removing a police superintendent, Police Board members and the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA) chief administrator, as well as approving departmental general orders, enacting its own policies and supervising the department, COPA and the Police Board.Asked how he would work with law enforcement in the 5th Ward, Yancy noted that he worked with the CPD in passing the oversight ordinance. \"Those conversations aren't easy, but they're important,\" he said. \"It's a slow process to get the police department bought into police reform efforts.\"He said police are largely responding to rhetoric like \"defund the police\" but he can work with them, with his personal background and his perspective that law enforcement is a partner in public safety that should not be othered.Neighborhood safety \u2014 residents' safety and police officers' safety \u2014 should be paramount as individuals in either group do not currently feel safe, Yancy said.\"It is helpful when police officers hear issues from people who have families deeply impacted by police misconduct,\" he said. \"One officer I was talking to who was in leadership at the time told me about how he, as a teenager, was assaulted by a police officer, which motivated him to become a police officer.\u201cThere's more to it, and as long as we look at it from our polls and don't look at it in terms of what the actual goal is, which is public safety, then we're going to have a much more difficult time.\"He wants to have the authority of an aldermanic office to motivate those conversations with more people, to do away with fear and build community support \"for the right efforts.\"Yancy is currently directing organizing and advocacy for the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, overseeing and facilitating the organization's policy and advocacy agenda. He continues to live in South Shore and is the father of an 8 year old.Promontory Point is one of their favorite places to walk, and Yancy is concerned about South Shore lakefront property owners affected by the lake's erosion and flooding. He called Hairston's July-passed South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance, \"a great start.\" He said more programs like it are needed, especially ones that are easily accessible to everyday people.Asked about constituent services, Yancy talked about modernizing the 5th Ward office. He would seek to hire young staffers to engage youth around things like political education, aiming to decrease distrust in government, as well as longtime 5th Ward residents, to add credibility to the office. He also talked of creating an \"office-on-wheels\" to bring constituent services to all four neighborhoods the ward covers.\"There's some level-setting that needs to be done with constituents,\" he said, setting the goal to under-promise and over-deliver. \"I think there are many constituents who think that alderpeople have particular power in their wards that they don't.\"Hyde Park's commercial corridors look different than South Shore's, which are beset by empty lots. \"As we look at that and look at the lack of employment, there's a direct correlation,\" he said. \"I would love to see grants or funding to small businesses, to capitalize them.\"As construction continues on the Obama Presidential Center, Yancy said he would like to see a mix of national and local businesses flourish along Stony Island Avenue, similar to 53rd Street's commercial mixture.\"I would just love for South Shore, Woodlawn and Greater Grand Crossing to feel like the same sort of community,\" he said. \"I know it's not anything that's going to be achieved in one, two or even three terms. However, I think setting the groundwork legislatively to ensure that those funds are there to capitalize businesses, offer some business support and use the weight of the office to encourage economic development will be important.\"Yancy wants to ensure the ward is attractive to new families and college graduates as well as longtime residents. He called for a balance between affordable housing and transit-oriented developments to curb runaway inflation in housing costs. He would like to see something like Hairston and Taylor's Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance for South Shore.Mental health is another issue of importance to Yancy. He said more resources should go into homelessness prevention, particularly in Woodlawn and South Shore. That call for equity would also include funneling resources to the ward's schools, so that, as he put it, Revere Elementary School, 1010 E. 72nd St., and Murray Language Academy, 5335 S. Kenwood Ave., could perform at the same level.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head.

Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S.

A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers.

Woodlawn Ave.ReporterLeft to right: county Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and her wife, First Lady Amy Eshleman, at the 10th Annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence in Hyde Park on Sunday at Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave.Mayor Lori Lightfoot endorsed the effort underway by some Democrats in the state legislature to ban assault weapons in Illinois at a Sunday night vigil for victims and survivors of gun violence at Augustana Lutheran Church.All local state legislators and Gov. J.B. Pritzker support banning the weapons in Illinois. A House committee held a meeting on Monday on a bill by Rep. Bob Morgan (D-58th) \u2014 whose district includes North Shore suburb Highland Park, where a gunman killed seven people and wounded dozens more at a 4th of July parade with an AR-15-style semi automatic rifle \u2014 to ban assault weapons and other high caliber weapons. Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) is co-sponsoring that bill.\"As we solemnly recognize the 10th anniversary of the Sandy Hook tragedy, this is our opportunity,\" she said, noting the 1 million Americans who have been killed or wounded by gunfire in the decade since the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school. \"This of course is an absurdity that in this country, with all our wealth, with our economy, that we can't solve this problem that plagues every community in our nation.\"She teased a city pilot program to provide more support to gun violence survivors in addition to banning assault weapons, saying it's about accountability and \"making sure that we're doing everything possible to make our communities safe.\"The Illinois General Assembly is considering a bill to ban assault rifles statewide in its January lame duck session. In a Monday interview after a state House committee's subject matter hearing on the topic, Buckner noted the Sept. 13 mass shooting in Washington Park that killed two and wounded seven more. No assault rifles were used then, and Buckner said discussions at the meeting included what to do about handguns modified with \u201cswitches\u201d to function like automatic weapons.Those are already largely illegal in Illinois, though criminals are altering those guns at home, often with parts bought online. Buckner got legislation passed earlier this year banning \"ghost guns,\" unserialized weapons often sold as a kit for at-home construction.\u00a0\"I don't know if that's going to actually make its way into this bill, but I think for communities where violence has plagued us for a very long time, that is a pertinent conversation that people are starting to bring up,\" Buckner said. \"I think we're a way's off from what the final piece of legislation will look like. We've got a chance for some amendments, fixes and some things that will make it more palatable to folks, and more effective. But I think that the appetite is definitely there.\"Buckner said he thinks legislation against gun switches would help, but he said he wants to have more conversations with violence-interruptors and law enforcement about how such a ban would work in practice.State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) spoke of the exhaustion that he and other advocates and policymakers face after years of mass shootings that make national news and \"shooting on the streets due to gang violence.\"\"We've been advocating the same solutions over and over and over again,\" he said. \"I'm tired of the fact that our approach to gun violence is to point at the community. Interpersonal violence is of itself a problem, but it is not the only problem,\" he said. \"Every time a bullet hits somebody, that is somebody's stock price going up. Every time there's a mass shooting, you look at Wall Street, and an investor is making a buck. It keeps happening, and those same people, those same investors, tell us, 'It's an individual's fault. It's your community's fault.'\"There is a clear correlation between mass shooting events and spikes in gunmakers' share prices. Peters said assault weapon bans would \"go after the fault of the problem: there are people making money hand-over-fist in this country when it comes to gun violence.\"Peters also said public safety means access to education, jobs, housing and transportation, not lock-them-up carceral policies. He praised anti-violence legislation in Illinois, which funds third-party programming in youth intervention services, violence interruption and trauma treatment. And he praised the University of Chicago Medical Center's new legal services for trauma victims (see story on page 7), saying more initiatives like that are necessary.The Rev. Nancy Goede, pastor of Augustana Lutheran Church, 5500 S. Woodlawn Ave., hosted the vigil. Her local colleagues Rabbi David Minkus of Congregation Rodfei Zedek, 5200 S. Hyde Park Blvd., and the Rev. Veroica Johnson of Hyde Park Union Church, 5600 S. Woodlawn Ave., who chairs the Interfaith Anti Violence Task Force of Hyde Park-Kenwood, also spoke.Johnson prayed to comfort victims' families, friends and communities. \"Unless we lament, which simply means 'cry out honestly about our pain,' we run the risk of normalizing this violence. We run the risk of getting numb by it and not getting moved by it,\" she said.\"Refuse to be silent,\" she said. \"Refuse to be silent about your loved ones. Refuse to be silent about guns. Refuse to be silent about all the causes of violence, including the historical lack of investment in our communities and young people. Cry out from your souls, and refuse to be silent.\"Chicago Survivors, which helps families affected by gun violence, organized the event. U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, Cook County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) and representatives from anti-violence and grief support organizations also spoke.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A view of Promontory Point from the northwest, August 1, 2021.\u00a0ReporterA view of Promontory Point from the northwest, August 1, 2021.\u00a0The Promontory Point Conservancy has requested that the Commission on Chicago Landmarks list the historic peninsula park as a city landmark, preferably at its Dec. 8 meeting.The request comes after more than a year of renewed advocacy efforts by community groups for a preservation-based approach\u00a0to needed repairs at the Point, instead of the replacement of limestone revetment with concrete and steel, as has been done along much of Chicago's shoreline.Though a preservation-based approach has been endorsed by elected officials \u2014 local Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th),\u00a0\u00a0Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot \u2014 a landmark designation also gives the Commission authority to review building permits for landmarks, to ensure that any proposed alterations will not negatively affect the character of the landmark.Beyond maintaining the Point's historical value \u2014 the limestone revetment dates back to 1939 \u2014 the conservancy argues that preservation of the stone steps is also be cheaper. The nonprofit points to three\u00a0locally commissioned studies from the early 2000s that found that preservation would cost less, be stronger and more aesthetically appealing than dismantling the limestone and replacing it with concrete.\u00a0The conservancy issued the draft report by preservation and urban design consultant Julia Bachrach for its request, which details the Point's history and argues for its listing as a city landmark.The report begins with the Point's conception in the 1890s by Daniel Burnham and eventual construction in the mid-1930s, when the federal government gave funds to the Chicago Park District to build it. Workers drove timber pilings bound together with steel into the lake bottom, after which construction debris and sand was used to form the peninsula. The step-stone limestone blocks were put into place around its perimeter.Prairie School architect Alfred Caldwell planned the landscape, head park district architect Emanuel V. Buchsbaum designed the park's pavilion, and a private donor commissioned the Wallach Fountain, by husband-and-wife sculptors Frederick C. and Elizabeth Haseltine Hibbard. The park opened in 1939.Anti-war activity around the placement of the Nike missile site in Jackson Park and a radar area on the point, installed in the 1950s, led to their removal in the early 1970s, and an activist group, \"Friends of the Promontory Point,\" began pushing for renovations in the mid-1980s.The landscape and pavilion were restored in 1989 and 1990, respectively. The work to save the Point's limestone began in the 1990s; the Park District, city and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would eventually plan a $300 million replacement of revetments along the entire lakefront. Activists opposed the replacement of the limestone with concrete and steel throughout the 2000s, but no federal dollars came for a preservation approach. The conservancy achieved its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.Bachrach\u2019s report says the Point meets several criteria for inclusion on the city register. It has value, she says, as an example of city heritage as part of Burnham's \"1909 Plan of Chicago\"; its limestone revetments are an enduring example of the city's \u201cpioneering and sustainable coastal engineering projects\"; and South Siders have enjoyed it for decades.She calls it a work of important architecture, in terms of both the architects attached to it and because of its Prairie School landscape and retainment of some of the city's last stepped limestone revetments. And she argues it is a distinctive visual feature along the lakefront with a high degree of historic integrity.An agenda for the Commission on Chicago Landmarks' Dec. 8 meeting will be released to the public this Friday.\u00a0Herald editor Hannah Faris contributed.\u00a0herald@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Michigan Ave. Per a March needs assessment conducted by the center, residents of the Near South Side, Bronzeville, Douglas, Oakland, Grand Boulevard, Fuller Park and Washington Park said that the \u201cmost desired services\u201d were group and individual counseling, followed by education programs and youth services.These centers are a direct result of the 2011 Community Expanded Mental Health Services Act, which gives residents the ability to create community funded and approved mental health centers under the city\u2019s Expanded Mental Health Services Program (EMHSP).\u00a0Members of the Coalition to Save Our Mental Health Centers and other area groups have been organizing to re-establish fully funded centers since 1991, when Mayor Richard Daley closed seven of the city\u2019s 19 public mental health centers. In 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel closed half of the remaining clinics. Of the five centers still operating today, only one is accessible on the mid-South Side: Kenwood\u2019s Greater Grand Mental Health, 4314 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0The groups said they gathered signatures the last two summers in order to get the referendum on the ballot.\u00a0Though the location has yet to be determined, in an August interview with Herald, Rebecca Jarco, assistant director of the coalition, said the location will be centrally located and accessible by public transport.\u00a0Similar referendums to establish a community mental health clinic also appeared on the ballot for residents of West Town, which residents passed with 85.43% \u201cyes\u201d votes.\u00a0Next steps include the creation of a governing commission of nine residents and two mental health professionals, appointed by Governor J.B. Pritzker and Mayor Lori Lightfoot, to manage the funds and assess needed services.Arteberry said that creating the center is a \u201ctwo to three year project,\u201d and that the commission will also be tasked with selecting the location and holding public meetings.\u00a0George and Tanger Fielder, South Shore residents who organize with the coalition, said that community needs will include treatment for post-traumatic stress disorders from community violence, depression and the stress that comes from living in poverty.\u00a0\u201c(The referendums) sets a good and effective precedent for a way to engage the community to address its own needs, and even to go a step further, to help provide the funding that we do need for our own situations that need to be remedied,\u201d George Fielder said.\u00a0\u201cThis could be a good vehicle to use in the future, so that we\u2019re more connected to the political system, and we don\u2019t have to feel like people in political offices can\u2019t hear us or can\u2019t attend to our needs,\u201d he added.\u00a0staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

  "text": "Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th)ReporterAlds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th)The City Council Committee on Public Safety has voted down the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified bans on no-knock warrants and other sweeping changes to the Chicago Police Department\u2019s search and raid policies.\u00a0The committee voted 4-10 to reject the ordinance in a Nov. 10 hearing, despite the testimony of its namesake at the meeting.Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th), a committee member, introduced the ordinance in February 2021 with the backing of the other Black women in the council\u2019s Progressive Reform Caucus, including local Alds. Sophia King (4th), Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th).The ordinance was introduced after a botched raid that affected social worker Anjanette Young in 2019. During the raid, multiple male officers entered her house incorrectly on a no-knock warrant while she was nude, ignoring her protests that they had the wrong location for 40 minutes. (The council approved a $2.9 million settlement for her last December after national outcry that the city was stonewalling its recompense.)\"Do the right thing,\" Young said at the November hearing, recounting the continuing mental health harm that the raid has caused. After the loss, Young told reporters that the fight would continue until the ordinance passes.In March 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the CPD leadership introduced policy changes requiring teams of officers to identify any potentially vulnerable people like children who may be at a site where they have a warrant. Guns are not to be pointed at children. Investigations leading to warrants must be documented. Warrants also require independent investigations to verify that information used to obtain them are accurate, with a review for wrong raids.\u00a0No-knock warrants are banned unless lives or safety are in danger; the Sun-Times reports that their use has been \u201csignificantly limited.\u201dWest Side Ald. Chris Taliaferro (29th) opposed the ordinance but fulfilled his 2021 promise of letting it come up for a vote before the committee he chairs.The Lightfoot administration argued against the ordinance, saying the CPD policy reforms were enough and that the federal consent decree monitors wrong and flawed raids. Hadden and University of Chicago Law School Professor Craig Futterman dismissed this, saying that the consent decree did not conflict with the ordinance.After the hearing, Taylor, who is not on the committee but attended its meeting, said that the vote showed that some alderpersons \"have not learned anything\" despite the reckoning that the nation has endured over race and police violence since 2020.\"They don't care about anything, and they definitely don't care about the people they represent. And they're not thinking about accountability,\" Taylor said. \"This is not me hating the police. This is not you being disrespectful to the people who are paid to serve and protect us. This lady is clearly telling you, as a social worker, what she's been through, how the city hasn't contacted her for any services or anything.\u201d\"They don't care,\" she repeated. \"This is why the police get to do what they do. This is why they get away with stuff, because they're not held accountable. They're made to be seen like they're above the law.\"Taylor discounted the CPD warrant policy changes, saying they did not meet the gravity of the moment and that police accountability promises are repeatedly broken. She said she could have called parents to testify about the police raids conducted in their homes in front of young children.\"We would have been devastated to hear how those young people feel. But we don't do that, because we don't want to know the truth,\" she said.The ordinance would have required a 30-second wait for police before they entered after knocking and for them to avoid with \"all available measures\" executing a warrant when children younger than 16 were present. Police would not be able to handcuff or point guns at children, and they would not be able to restrain or handcuff their parents or guardians unless they were immediately presenting a threat of physical harm. Pointing guns at adults would have been prohibited unless the target was an imminent threat of death or injury.The alderwoman is running for reelection next year and said she will continue advocating for the ordinance.\"I will never stop fighting for change. What am I here for? I could have stayed a community organizer,\" Taylor said. \"The fact that I have to fight with my coworkers for what is right in and around these communities is a problem.\"Looking ahead to the 2023 mayoral election, Taylor said she wants a mayor who is open to dialogue, conversation and collaboration with alderpersons: \"I want a person who will sit down with us and compromise.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (9th) chairing the Nov. 9 City Council Education Committee meetingThis story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.Some Chicago alderpersons want school district officials to meet with City Council quarterly, but a proposal to make that happen failed to pass Wednesday, Nov. 9.Under the ordinance, the measure would have temporarily withheld city money for certain school projects if Chicago Public Schools officials didn\u2019t show up. That turned out to be a deal breaker for many aldermen on the committee, which held a virtual meeting Wednesday.The vote was tied \u2014 and therefore, failed \u2014 with seven voting in favor and seven voting against.\u201cI currently have three projects in the hopper and I don\u2019t want to get in the way of my own best interest,\u201d said Ald. Susan Sadlowski Garza (10th), a former school counselor and Chicago Teachers Union member. She said quarterly meetings are \u201cnot a huge ask.\u201dAld. Sophia King (4th), who is running for mayor, put forward the ordinance during a committee meeting after being frustrated with the district\u2019s lack of response to her budget questions.\u201cThe threats of resources being withheld could very easily be waylaid, if CPS would just show up,\u201d King said, noting that she reached out to district chief Pedro Martinez \u201cquietly and subtly\u201d to try to get questions answered about the school district\u2019s budget \u201cto no avail.\u201dChuck Swirsky, senior advisor to Martinez, called it a \u201charmful ordinance\u201d that would jeopardize school construction and infrastructure projects.\u201cYou have our numbers, and we answer each time you call and I mean no matter what time of day it is,\u201d Swirsky said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly value the genuine relationships and partnerships that we have fostered with City Council members.\u201dBut Chicago Public Schools officials rarely appear before aldermen in public meetings. The Committee on Education and Child Development also rarely meets, despite attempts by council members to call meetings.It was the first time King led a meeting as the vice chair of the Committee on Education and Child Development, which has been without a leader since June when Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th) resigned to take a job in the private sector. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has since appointed Scott to the school board and attempted to appoint an ally and bypass King.The discussion comes after a report, prepared by the district with help from a consulting firm, released last week outlined the costs the city could shift to the school district once it transitions to an elected school board. It outlines hypothetical cost shifts on everything from school construction funding to water bills to summer programs.The city already started shifting costs to Chicago Public Schools in 2020 when it started requiring the school district to pay into a city pension fund that covers some school employees.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

Leslie Hairston (5th, right) speaks to Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd, left), chair of the City Council Budget Committee, and Ald. Sophia King (4th), Monday, Nov. 7On Monday, Chicago City Council voted 32-18 to pass Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s $16.4 billion 2023 budget. Like the City Council, local alderwomen were divided.Alds. Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th) both voted to pass the budget at the Nov. 7 City Council meeting, while Ald. Sophia King (4th), who is challenging Lightfoot for her mayoral seat in February, voted against.\u00a0The council also narrowly voted 29-21 to pass the mayor\u2019s property tax levy, which does not include a property tax hike to keep up with the rate of inflation, which Lightfoot had initially proposed in September.Notably, it's the first of Lightfoot's budgets Taylor has supported and the last budget Hairston will have voted on before ending her 24-year aldermanic career.King, speaking from the council floor, agreed with the budget\u2019s supporters that there were good things included in it, namely hundreds of millions to pay down the city's pension debt and for housing, but said it fell short on meeting the city\u2019s priorities, specifically public safety.\"I do not think that this budget addresses gun violence in a significant way,\" King said, noting an allocation of $85 million last year towards public safety, most of which has not been spent by Lightfoot\u2019s administration.Only $5 million of that $85 million in the last budget has been spent. King said alderpersons have asked the administration for details about anti-violence spending but have received none in turn. (She suggested the city spend $200 million on those efforts.) She said she herself has asked for more information about city funding for Chicago Public Schools but has received none.King said there should be money set aside for jobs training for young men of color, trauma-informed care and non-police responses to certain mental health 9-1-1 calls for service \u2014 all anti-violence initiatives \u2014 but that there is none. And she complained, alongside other alderpersons, that no Department of the Environment would be established in this time of climate change, something the mayor had campaigned on creating in 2019.\"This budget is not equitable,\u201d she said. \u201cThe resources, especially this year in our budget, spent towards African American contracting is down.\"\"Even low-hanging fruit, like having blocks in Black and brown communities just be clean \u2014 those are our city blocks..\"Taylor, for her part, said she was happy to see Black organizations get anti-HIV funding and to get an assurance that the Chicago Torture Justice Center, a Woodlawn nonprofit borne out of the city's history of police torture that plans a memorial for its victims, will get $250,000 in funding.\"They would raise $2 million \u2014 I got that in writing,\" Taylor said of the city's promises, adding that she was also happy to see no rise in the city's property taxes. But she still said that the city needed to do a better job in equitably funding street repairs in her ward and others like it, observing that South Side wards are bigger than North Side ones, due to lower population density, though funding levels do not recognize these physically larger areas.\u00a0As alderpersons pontificated on the floor before the vote, Hairston claimed in an interview that \"a lot of the comments being made are being made by people who didn't actually attend the budget hearings (and) did not submit amendments to the budget.\"Hairston said she has worked to get a transfer of the $15 million the city allocated in July for at-risk and in-need-of-repairs South Shore condominiums and co-ops.\u00a0\"Anybody can hold a press conference and say something. Actually getting it done is different,\" she said. \"The work is at the beginning, the middle and the end to make sure that everything is tied up to make sure that it actually happens.\"Hairston actually voted against the budget in committee last month and said her vote was motivated by the city making efforts to fix long-identified infrastructural issues in the 5th Ward. \"That doesn't discount the rest of the budget,\" she said.Despite the divided vote, Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), who chairs council's Budget Committee, received widespread acclaim from her peers at council for her leadership during the process.In her statement after its passage, Lightfoot praised the city's continued ratings upgrades from Fitch, purchasing of hundreds more emergency vehicles and millions of dollars for new police equipment, station renovations and public safety cameras. The budget ups the Chicago Police Department funding by $64 million to nearly $2 billion.While a Department of the Environment was not established, an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity was with $1 million in funding. Lightfoot's administration has proposed reviving the Department of the Environment in the coming years.More than $200 million is going to homelessness support services, including the construction of \"supportive\" housing and housing programs. Nearly $90 million was allocated for mental health services. The city has paid down $747 million in its outstanding debt.\u00a0\u201cOver the past three years, we have steered our city through some challenging fiscal storms,\u201d said Lightfoot in the statement. \u201cHowever, each and every time, we came together to collaborate on how to enhance the quality of life for all of our residents, and emerged to become the stronger, more vibrant city that we are today. This budget is a reflection of our hard work and values.\u201dIn her speech to council, Lightfoot said that $2 billion will have been made in economic development programs by the end of the year, touting her Invest South/West initiative.\"From streetscapes to vertical construction, retail, health care, affordable housing, community gathering spaces, and more, these are transformative, catalytic investments,\" she said. \"When we raise the fortunes of the South and West sides, we raise the fortunes of the entire City.\"At the post-council press conference, Cecilia Cuff, co-owned of the Bronzeville Winery, 4420 S. Cottage Grove Ave. in the Invest South/West 4400 Grove project, praised the mayor for her investments. (The winery received city funding.)\"I'm sure that funding like the Invest South/West initiatives has acted, for other businesses across Chicago, like a springboard,\" she said, praising the public-private partnership for the confidence it gives entrepreneurs and the additional capital it attracts from banks.\u00a0Without it, Cuff said it would have been hard to find funding for \"a space that doesn't seem like it's investment-worthy.\" And she praised the city for improving the neighborhood by developing businesses \u2014 ones where local workers can get paid a good wage in their own community.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

This ain't just about low-income housing; this is about housing for everybody,\" she added.The project is being developed under the conditions of the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which Alds. Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th) negotiated with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the City Council passed in 2020 to address concerns about gentrification and displacement in the neighborhood.\u00a0In her speech, Taylor expressed gratitude to the activists and organizers who fought for the Housing Preservation Ordinance \u2014 a process that began with activism for an OPC community benefits agreement. She also thanked the project\u2019s developers, and the Woodlawn homeowners and renters who provided feedback on the project alongside community organizations and churches.\u00a0\"Too often they use us to fight against each other, so this was the first time that we got to see us actually work together. And look at the finished product,\" she said.\u00a0Park Station is being built with $19.4 million in low-income housing tax credits, $5 million in tax increment financing (TIF), and $6.5 million from the city. BMO Harris Bank is providing additional financing for the project's total cost of $35 million.The Michaels Organization, a national affordable and mixed-income housing developer, is developing the property with Black-owned DL3 Realty, 90 E. 103rd St. Brook Architecture, 2101 S. Michigan Ave., is also Black-owned and the project architect alongside Loop-based FitzGerald Associates. Ujamaa Construction, 7744 S Stony Island Ave., and Brown & Momen, 823 E. Drexel Square \u2014 both part of the Lakeside Alliance building the Obama Presidential Center (OPC) \u2014 are the general contractors.DL3, led by managing partner Leon Walker, has been involved in a number of Woodlawn ventures, among them the award-winning Jewel-Osco at 61st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, as well as the new Friend Health headquarters at Cottage Grove and 63rd Street.In his groundbreaking speech on Wednesday, Walker recalled taking the \u201cL\u201d train from the long-since-demolished Jackson Park station at Stony Island Avenue to go downtown to shop. He then said that Park Station, itself a transit-oriented development right next to the Cottage Grove Green Line station, \"will lead a catalytic renaissance in this community.\"\u00a0\"There's something significant here,\" he said. \"Not only is this one of the first projects ever to have a Black developer in the leading role on a 90% tax credit project, but there's also a team with a Black prime (general contractor). We don't see that.\u00a0\"There's a new Chicago in many ways,\" Walker said. \"Yes, we are excited about the families that will be living here in a quality, luxury building \u2026 but it will be affordable to all of Woodlawn's residents.\"B.J. Stewart of Sunshine Enterprises, 503 E 61st St., the nonprofit set to offer business development classes to local entrepreneurs in the Park Station business center, said he was happy to be bringing \"resources that unlock and empower a tremendous force to community transformation\" to Woodlawn.\"Aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners in under-resourced communities face three gaps,\" he said. \"First is a relationship gap. These entrepreneurs don't have the resources and relationships they need to garner the resources that they need.\u201d\u00a0Stewart then identified a knowledge and information and, \u201cmost commonly,\u201d a financial gap caused by a lack of adequate capital. He said Sunshine would host a Business Community Academy to support micro-enterprise startups and early-stage businesses alongside training, coaching and mentorships through its business acceleration service and liaisons to capital.\"Thriving businesses lead to thriving communities,\" Stewart said. \"My team and myself at Sunshine Enterprises can't wait for Park Station to open, providing an additional launchpad for small businesses right here.\"Lightfoot praised Walker for his efforts to spread wealth to Black Chicagoans and Taylor, with whom she has tussled with on several issues in city government, for their shared commitment to getting the project right.\"We knew we had to get it right,\" Lightfoot said, recalling her 2019 community meeting about the OPC, land speculation and displacement at the South Shore Cultural Center, 7059 S. South Shore Drive. \"We had to roll up our sleeves, listen first and make sure that we came forward with community-featured recommendations.\"She called Park Station the \"first of many projects that are going to come to the benefit of the people of Woodlawn\" and her and Taylor's shared concern about the lack of affordable multi-bedroom housing for families. She also noted that residents will be able to go downstairs to the building's businesses to have their commercial needs met.\u00a0She added that the project will create 280 temporary and 12 permanent construction jobs, with hiring priority placed on Woodlawn residents.\"That is also the important investment that the city will continue to make in communities on the South and the West sides, and Woodlawn is going to be the beneficiary of that,\" Lightfoot said.\u00a0The afternoon after the groundbreaking, 50-year-plus Woodlawn resident Larry Johnson praised the project while sitting on an abandoned house's stoop across Maryland Avenue from the project with friends. He noted that the city-owned land Park Station is being built on was once a public aid office where his mother had gotten welfare payments that has since been vacant for decades.\"Look at all the people who are out here who don't have nowhere to live,\" he said, pointing to people sleeping at bus stops and others occupying\u00a0 vacant houses.\"I would love to see more development, because this is what we need. The more developments and things we have would eliminate a lot of homelessness and hanging-out in these old vacant lots,\" Johnson said.\"I don't want to be on anybody's property if I'm not supposed to be on it,\" he added.\u00a0 But \"people need to find somewhere to go,\" Johnson said, observing that life is about change and again welcoming the changes coming to Woodlawn. \"We need the change.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallReporterChicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown, Hyde Park \"Collabooration\" organizer Bennie Currie and Mayor Lori Lightfoot at an Oct. 27 press conference in City HallYouth anti-violence group Good Kids Mad City (GKMC) filed a federal lawsuit seeking to lift the city\u2019s 10 p.m. curfew for minors on Halloween night. The organization filed the suit so that young activists with the group \u2013 many are younger than 18 \u2013 can safely observe the police and try to keep the peace as they monitor the expected crowds of teenagers who come to 53rd Street every holiday.But at an Oct. 27 press conference, Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown said the curfew is unlikely to apply to the GKMC volunteers, as their actions are protected under the ordinance, which includes a protection for youth out past curfew who are engaged in First Amendment activities.\"There's plenty of opportunity in the ordinance itself for them to do exactly what they're saying they want to do,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'll let the court and the lawyers decide it, but there's nothing that prevents people who are active and engaged (from) staffing events from being out in the city. The curfew ordinance doesn't stop that.\"The ordinance, which passed City Council on May 25 of this year, does not apply to minors \"participating in, or returning home immediately after, a ticketed or sponsored event and has documentary evidence of their attendance,\" such as a ticket stub or wristband.\u00a0Minors are also protected if they are expressing their constitutional First Amendment rights, including assembly and the freedom of speech.The lawsuit, however, states, \"Despite the existence of a First Amendment affirmative defense, the text of the ordinance provides no guidance for how a CPD officer should evaluate whether a young person is engaging in First Amendment activity.\u201d\u00a0Per the ordinance a CPD officer can choose to enforce the curfew if they reasonably believe \u2018'that an offense has occurred and that, based on any response and other circumstances, no defense is present.'\u2019The lawsuit further cites the special order CPD issued after the curfew time was changed, which states that an officer can issue curfew violations when an \u201cofficer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred\" absent the aforementioned protections for youth who were at events or engaged in First Amendment activities. (A carveout for youth commuting to or from work also exists.)The GKMC lawsuit argues that the CPD special order does not give officers a clear process for \"recognizing, inquiring about, and/or analyzing First Amendment activity.\"Activists from GKMC and other organizations like the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights have monitored Halloween in Hyde Park for the past several years. Oct. 31 has seen rowdy crowds of youth come to the neighborhood since 2016. Halloween night in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 saw violence, property damage and arrests; the nights of 2020 and 2021 did not see arrests and were altogether less violent than the previous years.Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) began meeting with the police department-wide leadership as well as the local 2nd District, 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., and the University of Chicago Police Department to craft a less-heavy-handed law enforcement response to the youth disorder. Police began wearing, for instance, regular uniforms instead of tactical gear while patrolling in the neighborhood that night.A key development in the neighborhood has been the \"Collabooration\" effort that began in 2019 and aims to have Hyde Parkers out in front of their homes so that a good-willed and watchful public presence will defuse chaos before it starts. Its founder, local financial planner Bennie Currie, spoke at the press conference.\"We're building community block-by-block,\" he said. \"We have 25 blocks that we call 'activated' in Hyde Park. People like myself in orange shirts are block-activators, and they will be making sure that our residents are Halloween night are being very hospitable, that they have the lights on.\"\u00a0Currie pointed to the planned increased presence on 53rd itself, acknowledging that many of the youth there on Halloween night are from other South Side neighborhoods who come to Hyde Park because of its relative safety.Brown said there will be more officers deployed citywide this weekend than in the past. He said that the response in Hyde Park this year will be similarly collaborative, saying, \"I will point back to the last couple of years, where we've collaborated with Hyde Park and all the stakeholders (and Collabooration).\"\"It cannot be a police-only solution to community safety,\" he said. \"We'll be obviously much more visible and present in collaboration with all those celebrations. We'll be present at the celebrations, where we've been having gatherings, as well as with increased patrols.\"\"Police cannot resolve community safety alone. We need you,\" Brown said. \"We want everyone to have fun. We want you to enjoy being out. But we also want you to be safe.\"After the press conference, Currie said the police do not plan to have a line of patrol cars with blue lights lit up this year and noted that GKMC is partnering with Collabooration this year.\"We're just trying to make sure that we have people doing what we want them to do, to be welcoming and to be giving things to kids and celebrating, creating an atmosphere. And that's really what our focus is,\" he said. \"(Police) told us if something happens, yeah, the blue lights will be on, and I would greatly appreciate that.\u00a0\"But in terms of how they handle the curfew, that's not really what I'm focused on,\" Currie said, noting that most youth are out of the neighborhood by 10 p.m. anyway.The city's online resource with holiday safety tips and activities is chicagohalloweek.org.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) talks to reporters during the Oct. 26 City Council meetingMayor Lori Lightfoot speaks at an Oct. 26 press conferenceOct. 28 \u2014 This article has been updated to mention that Ald. Sophia King (4th) has set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.City Council rejected by a 29-18 vote an attempt by Mayor Lori Lightfoot to install Uptown Ald. James Cappleman (46th) to head the Committee on Education in its Oct. 26 meeting.\u00a0The proposed appointment bypassed Ald. Sophia King (4th), the vice chair of the committee and acting chair following the June resignation of its previous chair, former West Side Ald. Michael Scott Jr. (24th). King is running against Lightfoot in next year\u2019s mayoral electionFollowing the resolution\u2019s swift rejection by City Council, King rose to speak, criticizing the vote and the mayor. She also said her repeated requests for Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez to appear before City Council have been ignored.\"This is exactly what people don't want,\" King said. \"You know and I know that I've been asking the CEO of Chicago Public Schools to meet, to have quarterly meetings. That\u2019s 'bringing in the light.' That\u2019s transparency.\u00a0You saw with my colleagues today, they would like to have him come here, because we contribute millions of dollars every year.\"I didn't want to turn it into politics, but that's what it is right now. We really need to have a transparent government where we allow folks to understand and hear from one of the most important bodies in our city, and that's Chicago Public Schools.\"King identified herself as acting chair of the committee and said she assumed that Martinez was not returning her calls upon Lightfoot\u2019s orders.\u00a0Lightfoot in turn denied any knowledge of King's contact with Martinez, admonishing King for speaking about \"what is clearly a political issue for you.\"King said in turn that she had communicated with Lightfoot and her chief of staff over her request, adding, \"Quite frankly, if you would spend more time attacking problems than people, we\u2019d all be better off.\"Lightfoot ruled her out of order, saying that they could talk about the issue but that a council meeting was not the time nor place for it.In an exchange with reporters after the vote, King called the council rejecting the mayor's appointment of Cappleman \"a referendum on her leadership.\u201d She said she has been reaching out to CPS leadership for a date on which the CEO and his administration could report to alderpersons about the state of the district.Changing committee chairs is Lightfoot's administration's attempt to block transparency, King alleged, pointing out the dearth of Education Committee meetings. The committee had only met seven times between May 2019 and April 2022 despite an annual $175,000 budget, Crain's, The Daily Line and WBEZ reported.King had asked Lightfoot to be named chair of the Education Committee in May, after Scott announced his pending resignation. The alderwoman called the mayor's attempted appointment of a new chair \"retribution\" for her attempt to schedule a committee meeting with the CPS leadership.\"It wasn't a political speech. It's true,\" King said. \"I said exactly what people are thinking, that, if this mayor spent the same amount of time that she spends attacking people attacking problems (instead), our city would be much better off.\"In her post-council meeting press conference, Lightfoot said the rejection of her choice for committee chair, an uncommon occurrence, \"is a reflection of the politics that we live in right now.\" She noted that Cappleman, like King, has experience as a teacher and said he has her full confidence.\u00a0\"What happened was politics at work, but we've got to get back to do the business of the people,\" Lightfoot said. \"I'm confident that we will get him approved as Education chair.\"Asked if the council's rejection of Cappleman was less about the alderman and more about the process through which Lightfoot tried to appoint him, Lightfoot incorrectly said her appointment had cleared the Rules Committee the day before.In an interview before the press conference, South Side Ald. Michelle Harris (8th), the Rules Committee chair and mayor's floor leader, whose ward covers a section of South Shore, said the mayor's would-be appointment was directly introduced to the full council, not the Rules Committee.\u00a0\"Generally, every mayor since I've been here for 16 years has introduced their chairmen through this process,\" she said. She said whether she agreed with the process means less than her belief \"that mayors have the right to put in leaders of their choice.\"Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) also voted against the appointment. Ald Leslie Hairston (5th) was not at the council meeting because she is on jury duty.King and Lightfoot have clashed during a council meeting before, in May 2021, when the mayor ruled her out of order as she attempted to call a vote on her proposal to rename Lake Shore Drive for Chicago\u2019s founder, Haiti-born trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable. A compromise was reached the next month, renaming the expressway DuSable Lake Shore Drive.On Friday, King set a meeting for the Education Committee for Nov. 9.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015ReporterThe former Wadsworth Elementary School building, 6420 S. University Ave., in October 2015It's she-said, she-said with Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) about a plan to house hundreds of migrants bused to Chicago from Texas at the vacant Wadsworth Elementary School building in Woodlawn.\u00a0In an email to constituents on Monday, the alderwoman wrote that she learned at an Oct. 20 meeting with the mayor's office and the Department of Family and Support services that the city had identified the former Wadsworth building, 6420 S. University Ave., as a site to receive migrants.That building has been unoccupied for years since the Chicago Public Schools Wadsworth and Dumas elementaries were combined in 2013 and the UChicago Charter School's Woodlawn campus vacated in 2017.Taylor was also informed that Chicago Public Schools was working to provide the building with running water and heat, and that Lightfoot was asking for accommodations for 500 single women and men in the 20th Ward \"for a couple of months.\"Taylor wrote that she looked \"for alternatives that will make this transition more comfortable for our new residents as well as our current residents\" and said Spanish-speaking community organizations were helping her office \"find housing where individuals will be closer to the services they provide and have more independence due to the ease of navigating their surrounding community.\u201d She also admonished the mayor for lack of proper notice or request for community input.\u00a0On Oct. 25, however, the mayor's office announced that there are no plans to use Wadsworth as a temporary shelter. Lightfoot addressed the issue at her post-City Council meeting press conference the next day.Since Aug. 31, more than 3,500 people have arrived in Chicago from Texas, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) buses migrants out of state in protest of federal immigration policies. As it stands, the city has set up temporary housing accommodations in shelters and hotels, though Lightfoot said the shelter system is getting increasingly overwhelmed.\u00a0\"The fact of the matter is that obviously since the first busload of migrants, we stepped up as we should, because we are a welcoming city. And we can't be a welcoming city in word only; we have to be that in deed,\" the mayor said during Wednesday\u2019s press conference. \"Obviously as the number of buses came, we worked feverishly \u2014 around-the-clock in many instances \u2014 to make sure that we had adequate facilities to accommodate the residents who were coming from the border to our city.According to WTTW, on Friday, Oct. 24, Lightfoot began asking alderpeople to identify \u201cvacant warehouses or big box stores that could shelter between 500 and 1,000 people.\u201d\"As part of that process, we identified opportunities across our city to open up additional housing and support options, and we looked at a number of spaces, one of which was a closed school in Ald. Taylor's ward,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cThat's where it is: we looked, we evaluated it, we conferred with her and conferred with community members. I'm hoping, frankly, that we will continue to see no more buses coming to our city, but we're going to continue to work hard and make sure that we support the migrants.\"Though Wadsworth is set to remain empty, the proposal stirred up strife and frustration in a neighborhood that has been in a years-long struggle with the city to preserve affordable housing.\u00a0\"We acknowledge the irony of the mayor rushing to create housing in the same community where we have had to struggle with her to meet the urgent call for support from residents that are being displaced due to rising rents and property taxes,\" Taylor wrote in her statement on Monday. \u201cThroughout our push for the Woodlawn Housing Ordinance, the mayor and the Department of Housing attempted to convince us that the city did not have the resources to meet the need for deeply affordable housing with vacant land and properties.\"An earlier version of this article misidentified which Wadsworth Elementary School building was discussed as housing for migrant immigrants. It was the former Wadsworth building, now vacant, at 6420 S. University Ave., not the one the school currently occupies at 6650 S. Ellis Ave. The Herald regrets the error.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Pat Dowell (3rd) listen as Mayor Lori Lightfoot reads a note of congratulations to Williams from the city of Chicago on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0Artist Amanda Williams poses in front of tulip garden beds laid out in the footprints of 21 demolished residential buildings near the intersection of 53rd Street and Prairie Avenue for her new project \"Redefining Redlining\" on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's huge and it seems surreal, but it\u2019s also like you can stand here and see it,\" mused artist Amanda Williams on a brisk Oct. 15 morning as she watched volunteers plant 100,000 red tulip bulbs across several vacant Washington Park lots.The volunteers stooped over the dark topsoil of four brownfields surrounding the intersection of Prairie Avenue and 53rd Street, burying the bulbs six inches below the surface in an effort to dissuade thieving squirrels.The brownfields had been divided by Williams into 21 garden plots laid out in the footprints of 21 residential buildings that had once stood at the sites. Decades ago the dwellings had gone into disrepair and been torn down as a result of redlining, the racist federal practice of mortgage insurance denial that resulted in credit denial to residents of predominately non-white neighborhoods.\"We can't see policy, infrastructure, whatever,\" said Williams, \"but those weird shapes (the residential building footprints), they are just such a strange landscape.\"The tulip plantings are part of Williams\u2019 new project, \u201cRedefining Redlining,\u201d which she explained is being developed in part so that people can both visualize the magnitude of the impact of redlining and see that its impact is manageable.Volunteers from Brown & Son Landscape and Snow Removal plant red tulip bulbs in brownfields surrounding the intersection at Prairie Avenue and 53rd Street in Washington Park on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0Williams, a recent MacArthur Fellow honoree, is creating the project in collaboration with Emerald South Development and its\u00a0Terra Firma\u00a0initiative, which is actively cleaning and beautifying 205 acres of empty lots in the Washington Park, Woodlawn and South Shore neighborhoods.In its\u00a0biography of Williams, the MacArthur Foundation wrote, \"Amanda Williams is an artist who uses ideas around color and architecture to explore the intersection of race and the built environment. Her works visualize the ways urban planning, zoning, development, and disinvestment impact the lives of everyday residents, particularly in African American communities.\"\u201cRedefining Redlining\u201d isn't the first time Williams has put these ideas into practice on the South Side.From 2014 to 2015, Williams \u2013 covertly and without permission \u2013 painted a series of homes in Englewood that were slated for demolition. The paints for her project, \u201cColor(ed) Theory\u201d were saturated and eye-catching, born of a process to develop a \u201cunique, culturally coded, monochromatic color palette based on hues found primarily in consumer products marketed toward Black people along commercial corridors on Chicago\u2019s South Side,\" she wrote in her artist\u2019s statement.\"The project emphasized how colors have socially constructed associations that are inextricably linked to race and class,\" she continued.Photographs of the houses painted during the \u201cColor(ed) Theory\u201d project are in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the National Museum of African American History & Culture in Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago.All eight of the featured houses have since been demolished.The practice of artists converting vacant spaces into productive and community changing places has a significant history on the South Side.In the late 1990s, the self-taught sculptor Milton Mizenberg took 12 chainsaw-carved wooden sculptures out of his studio and placed them in two empty lots near his house at the intersection of 41st Place and Berkeley Avenue, in Chicago\u2019s Oakland neighborhood. He dubbed the impromptu collection of sculptures The Oakland Museum of Contemporary Art.\"There was a Hell hole here at the time,\" explained Mizenberg in a\u00a0short 2011 documentary. \"It was so terrible that lots and streets were full of cans and bottles.\"\"Something hit my heart and told me... go outside, go outside,\" he continued. \"So I said, \u2018Well, why don't I put some sculptures on these lots with cars sitting around\u2026 And the first thing to do was to get out the door and do it. You can\u2019t do it inside. You got to go out, and that\u2019s what I did.\u201dMizenberg began carving sculptures outside on the lot itself, \u201cin front of people, gangs and everybody,\u201d he added. \u201cI told them this artwork is yours; I don\u2019t own it\u2026 And that's what started me seeing the change in the Kenwood and Oakland area.\"Williams was raised in the city\u2019s Auburn Gresham neighborhood and now lives in Bronzeville with her husband and children.The genesis of \u201cRedefining Redlining\u201d lies in a conversation Williams had with her husband, Jason Burns, about the practice of options trading within commodities markets.During that conversation, Burns used the Dutch Tulip Market Bubble \u2013 also known as Tulipmania \u2013 of the 17th century as an example of how speculative markets function. Inspiration struck Williams.\"This idea of the bulbs, the speculation of the possibility of the bulbs, (just) made sense,\" she said. \"Like you do this thing, and it's going to be this other thing.\"\u00a0It was a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d Williams added, to imagine that one \u201ccan literally make a line (of tulips) to think about redlining.\u201d\u00a0As she thought about the project and a \"groundswell of opportunities\" began appearing that could bring it into existence, Williams said she settled on \"actually showing the houses that should still exist, were that policy not in existence.\"She found the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps, which, according to the\u00a0Library of Congress, were produced from 1867 to 1961 and contain detailed information about properties and individual buildings in approximately 12,000 cities and towns in the United States, Canada and Mexico.And since the Sanborn maps \"give us a pretty accurate sense of what buildings were here just at the time that redlining probably is really starting to entrench itself,\" she said, Williams used them to define footprints of the residential buildings that had been lost through redlining.(Left to right) as artist Amanda Williams, her daughter and Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) listen as Mayor Lori Lightfoot reads a note of congratulations to Williams from the city of Chicago on Oct. 15, 2022.\u00a0As Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd) joined the volunteers and planted tulips in the gardens on that brisk mid-October morning, Williams reflected on her efforts and those of the multitude of other artists and developers who currently are working in nearby South Side neighborhoods within the intersection of development, history and art. These include Emmanuel Pratt with Sweet Water Farms, Bernard Loyd with Build Bronzeville, Dorian Sylvain and Rahmaan Statik with various mural projects, Bill Hill with the Dorchester Botanical Garden, Theaster Gates with Kenwood Gardens, the Luv Institute and its Parade of Hearts, Tonika Johnson and the Folded Map Project and others.\"We'll look back and this would have been a moment,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe understand the power, it's coming from every angle, creativity.\"The tulips are expected to bloom sometime in April.Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.Redlining is as strong as ever.

  "title": "Lamont Robinson, state rep. (5th), running for 4th Ward alderman",
  "text": "State Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)ReporterState Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th)Rep. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) is running to replace Ald. Sophia King (4th) on City Council, leaning into his experience as a two-term state legislator and work in the private sector as an insurance salesman and former adjunct business professor.\"I'm hoping to take my statewide experience to the City Council to continue to improve the safety, equity and wellbeing of my local neighbors in the 4th Ward,\" he said in an interview. \"I see that there's a void in my community by Sophia King running for mayor, and I want to be able to fill that void.\"Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle's 4th Ward Democratic Organization has endorsed his candidacy.In terms of his track record in elected office, which he\u2019s held since 2018, Robinson is proudest of his advocacy to save Mercy Hospital, now called Insight Hospital and Medical Center Chicago, 2525 S. Michigan Ave. He also noted his legislation to remove lead pipes across the state with a requirement for minority-owned firms to do at least 11% of the contracts, as well as work to secure resources for public safety and to build centers for seniors, LGBTQ people and job-workforce development in his district.Robinson's district runs from River North down through the Loop, South Loop, Bronzeville and Washington Park, with a portion of South Shore. The 4th Ward runs along the lakefront from South Loop to 53rd Street in Hyde Park.If elected, Robinson would be the first openly gay Black male alderman and the second over all, after Rogers Park Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).Mercy Hospital\u00a0Robinson said he brought community groups, labor unions and religious organizations together to protest the planned closing of Mercy Hospital.Its former owner had reported millions of dollars in monthly losses and capital serious needs; the Insight Chicago nonprofit in turn promised to run the facility as a teaching and community hospital through at least 2029 after purchasing it for $1.\"We were out there for a year protesting, in the rain, sleet, snow,\" he said. \"I was at the forefront of that. I pulled together my neighbors; I pulled together the faith-based community; I pulled together the unions. And we kept that in the news, and there was national attention we got on that closure. And we were able to keep it open. Jobs were saved, and we don't have a health care desert in my community.\"Lead pipesRobinson's Lead Service Line Replacement and Notification Act establishes a Lead Service Line Replacement Fund administered by the Illinois Environmental Replacement Agency. It became law on Jan. 1 and requires owners and operators of community water supplies to develop an inventory of lead water service lines and implement a replacement plan. Chicago has reported 522,571 lead connections.The federal government's bipartisan infrastructure plan includes $15 billion to replace lead pipes nationwide. The Chicago Department of Water Management is accepting applications to replace lead service pipes for households with income below 80% of the area median income ($83,350 for a family of four) or for homeowner occupants, noting the high likelihood of houses and two-flats built before 1986 having lead water service lines. (More information is available at leadsafechicago.org.)Progress in Chicago has been slow, however, with WTTW reporting last month that less than half of 1% of 400,000 service lines, 154, have been replaced, though Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration said the city would remove 650 pipes by the end of last year through $15 million in federal grants.Robinson said he wants to be on City Council to spearhead efforts to replace the lines, adding that he has worked with Illinois U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth to procure federal resources.\u00a0Community centersRobinson pointed to the lack of a Chicago Senior Center in the mid-South Side and the number of seniors who live in the ward. \"I was able to secure $10 million for that effort,\" he said.\u00a0Site-selection is ongoing, as it is for the job-workforce center that is to run with the nonprofit Community Assistance Programs employment agency, 11717 S. Halsted St. He said it will be in Bronzeville and do workforce development in services and trades. It will also have a housing component akin to college dormitories, though there will be no age cap.Robinson also got funds for a to-be-built South Side LGBTQ community center, to be run with Howard Brown Health.He noted the millions of dollars in violence-prevention money he got from the state for the South Side, saying, \"That money has been out, and it has been in the hands of community-based organizations.\"\u00a0Public safety\u00a0According to Robinson, gang, drug and gambling activity is still common on 35th Street due to a lack of police engagement, namely giving out tickets and visiting local businesses. He said that is changing, though because of meetings with the area's alderwomen and Chicago Police Department leadership. Arrests and officer patrols are up.\"That's what we need to do on all the retail corridors in the 4th Ward,\" he said. \"I look forward to continuing to work with police to ensure that we have a safe community, but I think it's also important that we can close these gaps around violence when we engage the community \u2014 when we come together and make sure that we're calling 9-1-1 and reporting incidents.\"To ensure a bigger police presence would not lead to over-policing or racist incidents, Robinson highlighted the importance of community policing: having the same officers assigned to a corridor so that they can know residents and businesses.\u00a0More resources are needed. If elected, he said he would like to see greater utilization of the Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of Chicago's resources, especially their surveillance cameras and police forces.\"We look at Bronzeville, at 35th Street \u2014 there are local businesses there, and we need to make sure that we bring in new businesses, that folks are able to walk that retail corridor and feel safe, \" Robinson said. \"I think that that is needed because we haven't been able to see the needle move with respect to 35th Street.\"The 35th Street corridor does not have a special service area, the city's business improvement districts that use local tax revenue for beautification and to attract new developments. (SSA #61, aka Downtown Hyde Park, covers the 53rd Street corridor in coordination with the South East Chicago Commission.)\u00a0Robinson was a commissioner on SSA #47, on 43rd and 47th streets and Cottage Grove Avenue, which runs with Quad Cities Development Corporation (QCDC), 4210 S. Berkeley Ave., and claimed the 2014-opened Shops & Lofts at 47, 747 E. 47th St., as an accomplishment. Bringing in retail and affordable housing and removing blight is the goal on 35th. He also wants to advocate for the Chicago Park District to clean up its local properties after events.Robinson began his Allstate insurance agency\u00a0on 47th Street in Kenwood in 2007. (It's now at 5050 S. Indiana Ave.) He joined QCDC\u2019s board in 2009. He said he could utilize the relations he has as a state representative with large corporations in Illinois as an alderman.\u00a0He spent eight years at Kenwood Academy running the Kappa Leadership Institute mentoring program, which he said has sent hundreds of young men from Chicago high schools to college nationwide, and he taught business at Harold Washington College.Education is important to him, and he wants to work for the ward's schools from Printer's Row to Hyde Park. That means boosting neighborhood schools to attract students and projecting safety around them, which he called his ultimate responsibility.\u00a0\"As the current state rep., I have met with all of my neighborhood schools. And I look to continue doing that work as an alderman,\" he said. \"We can lean on Chicago Public Schools to give us those resources, or we can go out and get those resources ourselves.\"When King College Prep, 4445 S. Drexel Blvd., needed iPads, he connected the principal to Apple. He liaised the school leadership with the U. of C. to help it establish a health care and engineering education track.He runs his district office, 5048 S. Indiana Ave., with three dedicated staffers, including one who works on senior services, and interns from the U. of C. They phone banked seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic to gauge their needs, including food deliveries, and direct them to testing.\u00a0Should he be elected, he said he would bring his three staffers to run his ward office and work to create an app to inform constituents of goings-on in the ward and take in service requests. He said he would gain constituent feedback from coffee meetings across the ward.\u00a0\"I've been accessible as a state rep.; I'm going to be accessible as an alderman. I think that those are the things that people need to see (so they) want to stay in the 4th Ward and move into the 4th Ward,\" he said.\u00a0Robinson said he wants \"to put the community in the center of all decisions,\" including polling them to see what kind of housing and commercial developments they want. In addition to a local affordable housing shortage, he pointed to a shortage of local affordable commercial space. He would continue engaging with the advisory board associated with the development of the Michael Reese Hospital site and wants himself to get more information about the project's timeline.Working as a state legislator and liaising with various state departments would benefit his work as an alderman, particularly in terms of getting potholes filled. Being able to get the state to clean up the Dan Ryan Expressway would be similar to fostering clean-up efforts on King Drive or Cottage Grove.He said his personal background enables him to understand how marginalized people feel voiceless and the need to advocate for them in government. He nearly lost his business during the Great Recession and seeing it endure today is a testament to his work ethic and will to do whatever it takes to be successful \u2014 qualities he brings to his legislative work and would bring to the job as alderman.Robinson grew up in Chatham, the son of a public schoolteacher and a building inspector who died when he was 17. He attended Mount Carmel High School, Clark Atlanta University and National Louis University, where he earned a master's degree in business administration.He has a partner of 13 years who also sells insurance. Should he be elected, Robinson said his partner would continue running the business and that he would still work there, saying that the arrangement has not led to conflicts of interest in Springfield.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "King promises new CPD leadership, more officers if elected mayor",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Mayoral candidate Ald. Sophia King's (4th) newly released public safety platform calls for firing incumbent police Superintendent David Brown and hiring hundreds of retired officers and detectives to, respectively, do non-dangerous duties and improve the city's crime clearance rate.She would also turn back many of Mayor Lori Lightfoot's law enforcement initiatives, namely her establishment of citywide task force units, and return the 875 officers involved to full-time neighborhood patrols.King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0That proposal is similar to recent state action, including an Illinois Office of Firearm Violence Prevention that coordinates with and funds anti-violence community organizations. King also wants to create an Office of Gun Violence Prevention and expand money given to violence intervention programs that aim to give at-risk youth of color economic opportunities.\u00a0While some studies question the effectiveness of violence interrupters at preventing community violence, King said funding violence intervention programs \"at scale\" would be more preventative.Similar to the state's creation of a mental health first-responder system in coordination with the federal government's new 9-8-8 number that connects to suicide and crisis hotlines, King also calls for expanding responses to substance abuse-, mental health- and extreme poverty-related 9-1-1 calls that would provide non-law enforcement responses to nonviolent situations. (The city, meanwhile, began programs piloting mental health responses to emergency calls last year.)As more surveillance cameras have been installed throughout Hyde Park in response to a spate of violent crime last year, King proposes to do the same citywide, claiming that they and drones would be useful when physical pursuits or investigations could be dangerous to law enforcement or civilians.King also wants officer body cameras to automatically start recording upon officers unholstering their firearms.\"Why don't we have that technology?\" she asked in an interview. \"When officers are in a situation, one of the last things they're probably thinking is, 'Oh, I've got to turn my body-worn camera on.' They shouldn't be thinking about that; they should be thinking about community safety.\"She said she has been in conversation with violence prevention organizations and current and retired officers, including three past superintendents, though she declined to name them.King said not even $5 million of the $85 million set aside for violence prevention in last year's city budget has been spent; she proposes spending $200 million more on violence prevention over the next two years.\"We're in a unique situation where we've got millions of dollars of federal funds that will run out in a few years,\" she said, recalling the money the city got through the 2021-passed American Rescue Plan Act enacted to counter the financial, health-related and social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We should use that money wisely, put a dent in the real problems and scale up these programs.\"King proposes enacting all changes mandated by the Chicago Police Department's consent decree, enacted because of the police murder of Laquan McDonald, by 2027. In March, the department and the Illinois attorney general extended the deadline for reforms to 2030 instead of 2027.Fundamentally, \"We need to start distributing police more equitably, but we also need more police,\" King said, hence her proposal for recruiting 1,000 retired officers into a \"Chicago Reserve\" to work at festivals and the academy and on case management and desk duty. Adding more than 200 detectives could be done, she said, by internal promotions and hiring back retired detectives.That said, CPD is facing ongoing difficulties in filling its extant open positions and issues with burnout among officers. King said many retired officers are doing security work and wondered why they would not return to the force to do similar work \"for a city that's in peril.\"Her plan also proposes adopting $10,000 in home down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers on CPD and a $5,000 hiring bonus. She also proposes compressing the officers' workweek into one where they work two 10-hour shifts over four days, which would give them multiple three days off in a row every week instead of canceled time off and six days of work on end.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Review: 'Punch 9' offers sweeping look at Harold Washington's life and legacy",
  "text": "EditorEditor's note: This review was originally published on October\u00a022, 2021.\u00a0At the beginning of \u201cPunch 9 for Harold Washington,\u201d a television interviewer asks the former mayor what he would like a future historian to write about his administration.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019d probably say, \u2018That was a turning point \u2014 that was a turning point,\u2019 \u201d Washington responds.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPunch 9,\u201d a new documentary covering Harold Washington\u2019s time as mayor from 1983 to 1987, takes this idea seriously, examining a brief and near-revolutionary interlude in Chicago with an eye sharply attuned to its historic nature \u2014 both the awareness of the people living through it that they were making history and their reflections, 30-plus years after the fact, on the hard-fought triumph and melancholy aftermath of Washington\u2019s short reign.\u00a0Harold Washington and the documentary\u2019s director, Joe Winston, both have deep connections to Hyde Park: The mayor lived in the neighborhood during his time in office, while Winston grew up here and attended Kenwood Academy. Winston\u2019s previous work includes a documentary adaptation of \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?\u201d, the 2004 best-seller by Thomas Frank \u2014 another former Hyde Parker \u2014 examining the groundswell of populist conservatism in the American heartland.(Locally, or at least in the Herald\u2019s offices, Winston is best-loved for \u201cThis Week in Joe\u2019s Basement,\u201d his public access television show that ran in the late 80s and early 90s out of his parents\u2019 house.)\u00a0Political journalism is not new territory for Winston, then, and \u201cPunch 9\u201d \u2014 available to screen virtually at the Chicago International Film Festival through this weekend \u2014 deftly sets up its stakes at the beginning. Into the mid-'70s, Chicago is governed by Mayor Richard J. Daley, who presides over a vast and tentacular patronage system that privileges white ethnics and neglects Black neighborhoods. \u201cThe trains ran on time, but the schools were still segregated,\u201d runs one commentator's description.\u00a0Daley\u2019s sudden death in 1976 creates a power vacuum. Fellow Bridgeporter Michael Bilandic takes over, but not after a turbulent interlude during which Ald. Wilson Frost, the Black president pro tem of City Council, tries to declare himself acting mayor. Washington, then an Illinois state senator, observes that Frost would have become mayor if he were white.\u00a0During the terms of the next two mayors \u2014 the hapless Bilandic, undone by a 40-hour blizzard, and Jane Byrne, depicted in the movie as someone who betrayed the Black voters who delivered her into office \u2014 Black activists and politicians begin looking around for someone to run for the office. They settle on Washington, who had attempted an unsuccessful primary campaign against Bilandic in 1977 and was elected to the U.S. House in 1980. Reluctant to give up his D.C. sinecure, he asks for 50,000 new registered voters; with the help of Black activists like Timuel Black, who passed away on Oct. 13, 2021, that number is easily surpassed. (In a moment the film, to its credit, doesn't play up, Washington also says of the mayoral post that \u201cit might kill you but, boy, you\u2019d sure look good sitting in the saddle.\u201d)\u00a0The archival footage of Washington on the campaign trail and in press conferences makes for the film\u2019s most compelling moments. It\u2019s like bearing witness to a force of nature \u2014 not just for the power of his easy charisma and eloquence, but for how inevitable he makes his own ascent appear. He mocks Byrne charmingly during a primary debate; he\u2019s seen kidding around with a young boy at a campaign rally. \u201cReporters have to carry around their dictionaries to figure out what he\u2019s saying,\u201d recalls Hyde Parker Jacky Grimshaw, just before we see Washington call federal housing codes \u201cantediluvian.\u201dThe documentary is crafted almost wholly out of archival footage and contemporaneous interviews with notables like David Axelrod, Jesse Jackson and Valerie Jarrett. It makes for an immersive experience \u2014 watching grainy news reels, I felt lifted back in time to a city both familiar and a little strange, with its older cars, frumpier fashions and more overt racism.\u00a0When I spoke with Winston in 2019 while he was fundraising for the documentary, he said that he was worried that Chicagoans were beginning to forget some of the realities of Washington\u2019s time. \u201cHarold Washington, if we do nothing, is in danger of becoming just sort of an icon, a Santa Claus,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a simplified figure that people can evoke when it\u2019s convenient, without taking into account who he was or what he did.\u201dTaking its cue from this concern, \u201cPunch 9\u201d focuses much of its attention on the harsh realities of racial politics, and the implacable opposition of white politicians and residents to Washington\u2019s campaign and subsequent mayoralty. Bernard Epton, Washington\u2019s Republican opponent in the 1983 general election and a state representative from Hyde Park, used the campaign slogan \u201cEpton for Mayor...before it\u2019s too late\u201d \u2014 hardly a subtle nudge to white ethnic enclaves in the city. (One of the film\u2019s most interesting interviews comes with Epton\u2019s guilt-ridden, lachrymal son, who compares his father\u2019s campaigns events to Nazi rallies at Nuremberg.)\u00a0Even after Washington\u2019s narrow victory over Epton, his time in office is difficult, to put it mildly. He is obstructed at every turn in City Council by a bloc of 29 aldermen, all but one of them white, led by Eddie Vrdolyak and Ed Burke.Vrdolyak, on the night of the election, had reportedly told the precinct captains under his command that \u201cIt\u2019s a racial thing \u2026 don\u2019t kid yourself. I\u2019m calling on you to save your city \u2026 We\u2019re fighting to keep the city the way it is.\u201d While neither he nor Burke were interviewed for the film, the assurances from then-allies like Dick Mell that the issue was more about power than race ring hollow.\u00a0Washington is able to work around this deadlock at times, implementing the anti\u2013machine Shakman decrees and instituting affirmative action in city hiring. (The reality of Washington\u2019s relationship to the patronage system is perhaps a little more complicated than we\u2019re led to believe, as the political scientist Anne Freedman showed in a paper written shortly after his death.) He is also able to move funding toward a more equitable, neighborhood-first model.\u00a0City Council does eventually flip in his favor and he wins a second term, but Washington never really gets a chance to enact his full agenda: On Nov. 25, 1987, he slumps over at his desk during a discussion with his press secretary; he is pronounced dead of a heart attack that afternoon. \u201cPunch 9\u201d shows us the scenes from a prayer vigil downtown, where hundreds of people gather and begin to grieve after the news of his death is announced.\u00a0Part of the tragedy of Washington\u2019s untimely passing, the documentary suggests, is what came after \u2014 an unraveling of anti-patronage measures and the re-marginalization of the South and West sides, as Richard M. Daley assumed the city\u2019s mayorship in 1989 and proceeded to hold it for a record-setting 22 years. It is difficult to reconcile any of this with the determination and joy of the ascent; watching it, a gloom begins to set in.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the film, we are shown present-day footage of Black Lives Matter and Defund the Police protestors from the last several years, alongside an excerpt of Lori Lightfoot\u2019s 2019 victory speech on the night she became the third Black mayor of Chicago: \u201cOne day, you will stand on my shoulders, as I stand on the shoulders of so many...the shoulders of political giants, like the late, great Harold Washington.\"This is a strange juxtaposition \u2014 are these meant to represent two hopeful aspects of Washington\u2019s legacy? If so, we should admit that they are in tension; many of the participants in the recent social movements are deeply suspicious of electoral politics, and Lightfoot herself criticized protesters on multiple occasions last summer. But the film seems reluctant to acknowledge this, and the coda feels more like a half-hearted stab at hopefulness than a reflection on our continuities and breaks with the past.\u00a0If we return to Washington\u2019s words at the beginning of the film \u2014 that his administration represented a \u201cturning point\u201d \u2014 we might take them as a fact, and search our present, often in vain, for the progress he promised. But we might also hear them as a wish, unfulfilled through no fault of Washington's own. Then the film becomes something deeper and sadder, an archival examination of a city swept up in a movement that promised radical change, and watched with the knowledge that much of that change failed to materialize. By showing us history in vivid detail, \u201cPunch 9\u201d inhabits the spirit of a time whose promise still haunts us.\u00a0\u201cPunch 9 for Harold Washington\u201d is showing at select AMC theaters in Chicago through Oct. 14. Visit punch9movie.com\u00a0for more information and showtimes.\u201cPunch 9\u201d focuses much of its attention on the harsh realities of racial politics, and the implacable opposition of white politicians and residents to Washington\u2019s campaign and subsequent mayoralty.EditorChristian Belanger graduated from the University of Chicago in 2017.

  "title": "Martina Hone, city\u2019s former chief engagement officer, stresses long experience in government in 5th Ward aldermanic run",
  "text": "Tina HoneReporterTina HoneMartina Hone, chief engagement officer for the City of Chicago since 2020, has stepped down from her role to run for 5th Ward alderwoman. An attorney who has spent decades working on Capitol Hill and in City Hall, Hone joins a crowded field of candidates to replace outgoing Ald. Leslie Hairston.She was born in Hyde Park to a white father and a Black mother who met on the former 57th Street bridge between the beach and the Museum of Science and Industry. Her father once noted that she can walk into a room without people making racialized judgments about her and that her experience is different from most other Black people\u2019s.\u00a0\"I don't want to diminish and disrespect the very real challenges that people who are much more visibly African American face, including the people in my family like my sister and my mom. They face the real discrimination of being followed around the store. My nephew was stopped for 'driving while Black,'\" Hone said. \"It's a very real experience that is not part of my experience, but vicariously and very painfully, seeing what's happened to my family and to other people I love.\"She recalled how mean the landlord of their building at 54th Street and Dorchester Avenue was to her single mother after her parents' divorce before their move to Chatham and then Roseland.Hone said seeing the disparities between her father's white experience on the North Side and her mother's Black experience on the South Side, \"That whipsaw, that very visible seeing it, experiencing and feeling it is what made me such a fierce social justice warrior.\"\u00a0She eventually moved back to Hyde Park for college at the University of Chicago before moving west for law school at the University of California, Berkeley. After a few years working at law firms, she taught middle school in the Bay Area through Teach for America, which in the early 1990s was a new organization.She moved to Washington, D.C. after that, hoping to work in education policy but wound up taking jobs in the House Judiciary Committee (with a focus on immigration policy), the Commerce Department (specifically the 2000 census) and the American Legacy Foundation, an anti-tobacco use organization. In total, Hone spent more than 20 years working at the Capitol.Hone moved back to Hyde Park six years ago after her first husband died; she worked at YWCA Metropolitan Chicago for three years, ending as chief equity officer. In September 2020, she began work as Mayor Lori Lightfoot's chief engagement officer; she did not work on her 2019 mayoral campaign.In mid-September she left Lightfoot\u2019s administration to launch her aldermanic bid. As a four-year member of the Fairfax County School Board in Northern Virginia, she is the only declared candidate thus far who has experience holding an elected office.She said her experience in Congress matters as much as her experience in local government. \"All of the roles matter, because what you come to understand is it's easy to grandstand, make empty promises and say what you're going to do, but the actual task of getting things done is far more complicated and far more nuanced,\" she said.Hone was the only Black person on a school board for an affluent district in which Black and brown students made up a third of enrollment. She created an organization, Coalition of The Silence, composed of parents of color and parents of students with disabilities to advocate for their children's needs. Hone said they got third grade reading levels measured as a marker of student progress as well as kindergarten readiness considered and discriminatory discipline policies changed. She also got more people of color elected to the school board.\u00a0\"Understanding how to work in coalition and understanding how to listen to all views\" comes in handy, Hone said, in the \"incredibly complex\" 5th Ward. She noted that it contains five community areas: Hyde Park, Kenwood, Woodlawn, South Shore and Greater Grand Crossing. \"To be able to represent every part of this ward, one really has to be open enough to hearing a diversity of views,\" she said.\u00a0To do that, Hone said she would create a community council made up of representatives of all community areas and not solely comprised, she said, of \"the usual suspects.\" Not that she has anything against them (\"They become the usual suspects because they do something\"), but because there are important, smart and thoughtful people who are nevertheless apolitical and therefore are not getting their views expressed in public discourse.\"I actually would spend the time, as I did as chief engagement officer, trying to find the people who may not traditionally be at tables and give them space at the table,\" she said.\u00a0Echoing other declared candidates, Hone said public safety is a top concern of 5th Ward voters she's spoken to, adding that it\u2019s not a problem she believes can be solved with increased policing.Better policing, like shorter response times, is needed \u2014 she noted staffing shortages in the Chicago Police Department and suggested different assignments or restructuring \u2014 but she said that law enforcement will not be the thing that makes Chicago safe. She noted generational trauma's role in crime and the \"enduring results of economic disenfranchisement in the Black community.\u201d She noted the importance of entrepreneurship programs and others to help developers and contractors to counteract this, but she also wants a \"meaningful\" job program.\u00a0\"There are vacancies in the city of Chicago that could be prioritized for not the Black community, but communities that have been experiencing the most chronic levels of unemployment and the lowest levels of income,\" she said. \"Not surprisingly, those end up being predominantly Black communities.\"\"One of the hardest parts of governing is that you are generally dealing with competing legitimate interests,\" she said, recalling the town hall meetings she ran on the city's planned casino to be built in River West that has upset nearby residents. Hone said community input is an important part of the decision-making process but not dispositive.While Hone is an alumna of Lightfoot's administration, she emphasized that she is running as Tina Hone. \"Among the reasons it was incredibly important for me to step down is because I wanted to be sure that the people of the 5th Ward understood that I am not here as anyone's puppet,\" she said.She nevertheless said she has a good relationship with Lightfoot, who is running for reelection, and said of the mayor: \u201cI wish people understood her better\u2026 Like all people, she loses her temper. But in my experience, it was as constructive a work environment as I\u2019ve ever worked in.\u201d\u00a0This contrasts with the working relationship many alderpersons say they have with Lightfoot. Ald. Sophia King (4th) has been motivated to challenge Lightfoot for her job based in part by how bad she said relations are with City Council and how low in esteem alderpersons are held as partners in governing the city.Regardless of who wins the mayoral election, Hone noted the huge number of vacancies coming to City Council, calling the incoming number of freshmen alderpersons \"a fresh start.\"\"I think it's a great opportunity to have a restart button where City Council members can have a more active role in not just representing their wards but being partners in the governing of the city,\" Hone said.\u00a0In terms of local development, Hone said she is a supporter of the Obama Presidential Center, but hopes the engagement process going forward \"is broader than just the communities just directly around the Obama Center,\" noting the effect the closure of Cornell Drive will have on Far South Side communities like Roseland.\u00a0Hone believes the OPC will lead to the revitalization and redevelopment of South Shore, and she wants to ensure that any benefits that come are equitably shared. \"It's important that we put development dollars into neighborhoods that have been completely disinvested in,\" she said. \"71st Street should be as vibrant as 53rd Street.\"Many South Shore residents and community organizations, such as Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) \u2013 a member of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition \u2013 however, have repeatedly raised concerns that the \u201credevelopment\u201d of the neighborhood could lead to widespread displacement as housing costs rise. Calls for the development of more affordable housing in the neighborhood \u2013 such as what was guaranteed in the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance \u2013 and stronger protections for renters have largely been ignored by the City.When asked about maintaining affordability in Hyde Park, Hone said homeowners should be able to take advantage of increasing property values without the risk of losing their homes. She said that large rental companies like Mac Properties and Pangea Properties operate like monopolies, decrying the declining number of mom-and-pop resident landlords and calling it \"a much more important piece of the affordable housing puzzle\u201d than most people recognize.\"When you're in the neighborhood and it's your building, you're going to take care of that building in a different way than being an absentee investor who just bought up a lot of six-flats,\" she said. \"We need to figure out how to make mega-developers accountable for the things that they're doing and are able to do in terms of increasing rents subtly.\"Incentivizing landlords to buy and operate locally and at a small scale through financing is something the council should investigate, she said.Hone said her experience in government would give her a leg up in handling constituent services, particularly in the Byzantine city bureaucracy. Not only does she know who to call, but she said she has existing relationships with people in local departments and agencies. She said she would like to open a service office in a central location in the ward.And she said she would be a steady advocate for Promontory Point, which holds personal significance to her as a native Hyde Parker. \"I really, really believe there is a way to preserve the point with the limestone and beauty that it is. And it'll be a priority to me,\" she said.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.Mayoral candidate Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner unveils plan for Chicago Public Schools outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side on Thursday, September 22.This story was\u00a0originally published\u00a0by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at\u00a0ckbe.at/newslettersMayoral hopeful Kambium \u201cKam\u201d Buckner is promising to transform Chicago Public Schools by funding schools based on need, not enrollment; staffing every school with a nurse, librarian, and social worker; and expanding universal preschool to all 3-year-olds.\u00a0Buckner is the first 2023 mayoral candidate to hold an event releasing his\u00a0education platform. He detailed the plan outside the shuttered Laura S. Ward Elementary School in Garfield Park on the West Side, one of the 50 schools closed in 2013 by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\u00a0Buckner is\u00a0one of seven people\u00a0planning to challenge Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who is seeking a second term. Three aldermen and\u00a0former CPS CEO Paul Vallas\u00a0are among the candidates.\u00a0The Chicago Teachers Union has yet to throw their support behind a candidate. Cook County Commissioner Brandon Johnson, a former teacher and union organizer, last month said he was exploring\u00a0a possible run for mayor.\u201cAs mayor, I will continue to work with Springfield to hold CPS accountable for directing state funds to schools based on need, and not on any other criteria,\u201d Buckner said, adding that funding should not be strictly based on enrollment.Currently, schools get a set amount of money per student, plus a few centrally-funded positions, such as principal and school clerk. This system \u2013\u00a0implemented in the wake of the 2013 closings\u00a0\u2013 has been\u00a0criticized by the Chicago Teachers Union\u00a0because it\u00a0penalizes schools with fewer students\u00a0and sets them on a downward spiral of declining enrollment and disinvestment.\u00a0 Others \u2013\u00a0including former CPS CEO Janice Jackson\u00a0\u2013 have said the method is more equitable because money follows students.\u00a0Chicago\u2019s schools have seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past two decades. Though this year\u2019s official enrollment numbers have yet to be released, preliminary data\u00a0posted to the city\u2019s data portal\u00a0and\u00a0first reported by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times\u00a0indicates there are roughly 320,000 students in CPS. Twenty years ago, there were more than 438,000.\u00a0\u201cWe have to have a plan forward on how we maintain the number,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cBut to bring more young people into our school system, we have to provide better options, better choices in our neighborhood schools.\u201d\u00a0The proposed switch in how schools are funded also comes with a promise to staff every school with at least one nurse, one librarian, and one social worker. Currently,\u00a0many social workers\u00a0and\u00a0nurses split time across two or more schools\u00a0and librarians are becoming something of an endangered species in CPS, with about\u00a090 librarians\u00a0across more than 650 schools.\u00a0Chicago Public Schools has added about 90 school social workers since 2020, going from around 500 positions to roughly 590 this summer, according to a Chalkbeat analysis of\u00a0staffing files posted on the district\u2019s website. The number of nurses on staff is more difficult to track because the district\u00a0hires different types of school nurses\u00a0and relies on outside agencies to provide school nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Buckner\u2019s promise to expand universal preschool to 3-year-olds comes as the school district\u00a0continues to recruit families to enroll their 4-year-olds. This is the first year Chicago has offered universal access to preschool, regardless of income, a push\u00a0set in motion in 2018\u00a0by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also expanded public preschool to 3-year-olds,\u00a0using a windfall of federal stimulus money.\u00a0\u00a0Dwayne Truss, a\u00a0former member of the Chicago Board of Education, introduced Buckner, who stood in a vacant lot across from the abandoned elementary school, and endorsed Buckner\u2019s education plan. Truss previously told Chalkbeat he was asked to continue on the board after his term expired, but was replaced by Lightfoot. Truss was critical of a plan for a new high school on land intended for public housing.Buckner declined to comment specifically about Truss\u2019 ouster but said the school board should be composed of representative voices that reflect the community, are passionate about education, and who aren\u2019t afraid to push back.\u00a0\u201cDwayne Truss is a lifelong Chicagoan,\u201d Buckner said. \u201cHe understands the South Side and the West Side. He has worked to better education around the city for a very long time. Not listening to somebody like him is a huge detriment to all of us in the city.\u201dBuckner currently serves as Illinois House of Representative for the 26th District, which includes Bronzeville, Douglas, the Gold Coast, Near South Side, South Chicago, and South Shore. He has been in office since 2019.The state representative was raised in Roseland and Washington Heights. His mother was a public school teacher for more than 30 years. She worked at Scott Joplin Elementary School in Auburn Gresham and Alcott Elementary in Lincoln Park before retiring about five years ago, he said.Buckner previously worked as an aide for\u00a0Sen. Dick Durbin and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. He also worked as a manager of neighborhood and government relations for the Chicago Cubs, and executive director of a youth development nonprofit World Sport Chicago.Becky Vevea is the bureau chief for Chalkbeat Chicago.

  "title": "Ald. Taylor seeking reelection in 20th Ward that will contain part of Hyde Park",
  "text": "Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th)ReporterAld. Jeanette Taylor (20th)City Council will see tremendous changeover next year, with the likelihood of some incumbents losing reelection and the large number of alderpersons retiring.\u00a0But one of the body's great firebrands, first-term Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), of Woodlawn, wants another four years, saying she has listened to her community and delivered for it after decades of wayward political leadership.\"I've been a woman of my word. I've stood up for my community; I've stood with my community,\" Taylor said in an interview. \"I still have a lot of work to do. You can't change culture and community in four years, but I feel like the community is moving in the right direction.\"She said she has turned power back to the community over her three-plus years in office, specifically gaining constituent input in decisions around development and other ward business.\"There's a community development team. Those are 15 people who I didn't know before I got into office, and they look into development with me,\" Taylor said. \"So I don't meet with developers one-on-one; I meet with them with the team, and they actually reach out to the community, to get them to have two community meetings and decide whether they want the development to be in the ward or not.\"Development team members volunteer their time; Taylor said they live across the ward and meet two or three times a month. Developments haven't been turned down per se; the team gives feedback and asks developers to revise plans.\u00a0They asked DL3 Realty and Michaels Development, for instance, to include more family units in the $30.8 million Park Station development to be built at 63rd Street and Maryland Avenue. Forty one of those units will be affordable; Park Station is the first to be built under the terms of the Woodlawn Affordable Housing Ordinance Taylor and Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) passed with Mayor Lori Lightfoot in 2020.She also said she is ensuring that developers do construction work considerately: \"You've got to keep it clean, or you're getting a ticket. You've got to start after 8 o'clock, or you're getting a ticket.\"\"We have plenty of business developers who come to our ward who want to develop. It's about them being able to get up in the community,\" she said. \"One of the things I hear clearly when I knock doors is 'I'm tired of coming home and there's a new business or development that I knew nothing about.' So (I make) sure that I inform the community and they're at the table when we're talking about this. And that takes longer, because the developers have to knock doors, and we have to make time for people to participate and have community meetings.\"Taylor, who has made a habit of giving her personal cell phone number out to anyone who wants it, said she is at her office, 5707 S. Wentworth Ave., for open meetings from noon to 7:30 p.m. on Thursdays. She also hosts a monthly ward night.\u00a0She said her ward office has made a practice of following up on 3-1-1 city services requests constituents tell them about. \"You call this office, we make sure we follow up,\" she said. \"It's not a thing of you saying, 'Hey, there's a hole in the street.' I'm asking you to send me that service request number so that we can follow up. And we follow up with the community to make sure those things happen.\"\"I have a personal relationship with the people in the ward,\" she said. \"When they feel that their needs aren't met, that's a conversation they can have.\"Taylor called public safety one of the ward's most-pressing concerns, adding that she wanted to see constituents take more responsibility for the issue and not pass all problems on to the police. She said she has highlighted organizations focusing on violence-prevention, education and youth development to ensure constituents know about their services, specifically touting newer ones like the Woodlawn Restorative Justice Hub, 602 E. 61st St., or LaTanya & The Youth of Englewood, 3135 W. 63rd St., on top of more established ones.\u00a0In terms of quality of life, Taylor said \"the ruckus and mess\" on 63rd Street's intersections with Cottage Grove Avenue and King Drive, spots that have had issues with drug-dealing, shootings and loitering, have declined as she has engaged with the state Department of Children and Family Services, community organizations and local churches.Absent the drug-users getting sober \u2014 which remains a goal \u2014 Taylor said she would like to have a community conversation about opening some kind of location where people could go off the street, like a small park.\u00a0She said public safety conversations with constituents reflect that the solution often lies in community efforts and investment, as opposed to more policing.\u00a0\"I've been willing to work with the community, CPD and the community organizations to say, 'How can we work together to create change and get people what they need?'\" Taylor said. \"We've done it. We don't want to be 53rd; we want to be 63rd. People forget what 63rd used to be like. 63rd used to be a place you could shop and get anything that you needed right in our own community, and that's what we want to go back to. But better yet, we want to own the institutions, and we want institutions that look like us in our own community.\"Politically, Taylor is not Lightfoot's ally on City Council: The alderwoman has voted against the mayor's budgets, and the two made headlines for their heated June 2021 discussion on the council floor over the terms of the city's settlement with Anjanette Young, the social worker who was victimized by CPD during a mistaken raid of her home in 2019.\"I can agree to disagree with her, but that doesn't mean I don't have to work the floor,\" Taylor said, adding that the two have a working relationship: \"We are two Black women in a space where there's not a respect for Black women anyway, and so what will my community gain by fighting with her? Absolutely nothing.\"Taylor said she has learned to trust people more in order to turn the gears of government \u2014 both her colleagues and workers in the city's bureaucracy. But \u2014 no surprise, coming from someone who cut her teeth in community activism \u2014 she said \"the squeaky wheel gets the oil\" in regards to delivering municipal services.\"After my first budget meeting, when I went off on a lot of these departments and I told them I'm not a person you can't talk to. I'm not a person who's not willing to work with you; I just want to make sure those services get done. I really don't have any problems,\" she said.The once-a-decade ward redistricting process was chaotic, however. Taylor's constituency, the 20th Ward, will geographically change. Traditionally Woodlawn's ward, it still contains most of that neighborhood after the council's post-census remapping, alongside the southern half of Washington Park and portions of Englewood and Back of the Yards.\u00a0The Black Caucus fought tooth and nail to preserve a large number of majority-African American wards in the city, hence ward boundaries' tortured lines slicing up communities and neighborhoods across the South and West sides. Beginning next year, the 20th Ward will also contain a small section of northwestern Hyde Park.Taylor, facing reelection, is running on her record, saying, \"For people who are saying ain't nothing changed in four years, I doubt that very seriously. Because what relationship did you have with the previous alderman?\"Taylor's two immediate predecessors are convicted felons; the one before them died, and his predecessor was also indicted. Taylor, for her part, wants two more terms.\"We need to have hard conversations about our young people and violence that goes on in our community, but we also need to be realistic about what to do with it. I feel like I bring transparency to the table, and I want to have those hard conversations. And while I don't have all the answers, I expect the community to help me come up with those answers. Because we have some pretty smart people in the ward, some people who've done this, some people who will help us not repeat some of the history that's happened in the community.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Adrienne IrmerReporterAdrienne IrmerAnother candidate has thrown her hat into the ring to succeed retiring Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th): Adrienne Irmer, a public policy administrator and commissioner for Special Services Area #42, which oversees economic development in South Shore.Irmer announced her candidacy on Tuesday, September 13 with an early endorsement from former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun and an eagerness to explain how her professional and civic background would prepare her well for public service on City Council.Raised in Hyde Park, Irmer now lives in and is raising children in South Shore. \"I have service in my heart and in my blood. I was raised to be a community-first person,\" she said. \"I think it's a great opportunity to give back to these two communities that made me who I am.\" Irmer is also the daughter of Perri Irmer, president and CEO of the\u00a0DuSable Museum of African American History, 740 E. 56th Pl.Irmer said she would be \"a very strong steward for the ward\" from the first day on the job, pointing to her current role as assistant vice president of external affairs at the Illinois Institute of Technology and past constituent service work for former state Sen. Kwame Raoul (D-13th).From her professional experience, Irmer said she said she would be able to build relationships and coalitions to get services for the ward and win council votes. She said she knows how municipal government works in collaboration with state and federal governments. (In her role at Illinois Institute of Technology, she's lobbied with other universities for the state to increase the amount of money in the Monetary Award Program (MAP) grants given to income-eligible Illinois students.) And she said she is familiar with the city's bureaucracy.In 2020, Irmer was also appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot as commissioner for Special Service Area #42 (71st Street and Stony Island Avenue), where she has been involved in investing money for things like beautification, litter abatement and surveillance cameras in concert with the Department of Planning and Development.\u00a0If elected, Irmer said an early priority would be to set about streamlining ward services like tree-trimming, snow-removal and road-repair.\u00a0\"There's a process at the city that bottlenecks, and it bottlenecks around 3-1-1,\" she said. \"What I would like to do is make it part of the staff's job to batch all of the 3-1-1 requests every week and figure out where the requests are coming in so that if we get a tree-trimmer, we can deploy them all at once to the same area instead of having to double-back to the same area.\"She would like to effect a city-wide program through ordinance, \"to development a system that's actually streamlined at the process level at the city, so that they're also doing that as opposed to us as alderpeople also having to streamline their request process.\"\u00a0\"Every alderperson has to provide these services to their constituents. It would be in their best interest to figure out a way that we could streamline the process at the city level, because then we all get the service that we need and people don't get trees interfering with their power lines and potholes sitting open for months and seasons on end.\"In terms of public safety, Irmer is interested in the city's pilot Corridor Ambassador program, in which community organizations like Bright Star Community Outreach, 333 E. 35th St., provide trauma counseling, anti-violence intervention training and workforce development programs.\u00a0\"That's a solution that doesn't cost a billion dollars but is actually really effective at putting community members in front of community members to connect them with resources that they need, whether it's workforce development, housing or childcare. I think that would go a long way towards making communities safer without necessarily relying on very expensive policing,\" Irmer said.In terms of housing, Irmer said she would like to see developers put in more affordable units in transit-oriented developments, the city-incentivized mixed-use developments within a short walking distance of public transit.\u00a0In line with her role at SSA #42, Irmer said she would like to \"take a hard look\" at the city's vacant property tax relief program to promote business development in South Shore.The county assessor allows owners to apply for tax relief for two years if they are making \"good faith efforts\" to lease the property. Block Club has reported that three in five storefronts on 75th Street in South Shore were empty in 2020 and that nearly half on 79th Street were as well. Irmer said the city needs to assess with the assessor and other stakeholders how long commercial property owners have been taking advantage of a tax break that incentivizes keeping their properties vacant.Additionally, she wants to examine how to get banks to finance business owners who want to open on 71st Street and other commercial corridors like it. \"As I'm knocking doors, I'm hearing wonderful business ideas, and I'm also hearing from folks that it's difficult to get the funding,\" she said.\u00a0If elected, Irmer said her ward office would employ a staffer working on business, economic and community development to liaise between city departments, chambers of commerce and organizations like the Urban League to bring resources to would-be entrepreneurs.\"I have a vision of an office with very, very talented people who are hungry to bring resources to the 5th Ward and will work collaboratively, innovatively and help get the work done with me,\" she said.Asked about Hyde Park, Irmer said she would like to use the aldermanic office to bring together decision-makers like the University of Chicago with community members to discuss what kind of businesses are wanted in commercial properties the university owns. She noted the U. of C.'s nonprofit and business incubators and suggested work be done to encourage participants in those programs to open locally.This is Irmer's second campaign for public office, after coming in fourth place in the 2018 primary election to succeed longtime Rep. Barbara Flynn Currie (D-25th) in the Illinois House. This time, Irmer said she is paying better attention to campaign data and has hired more experienced staff.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Gabriel PiemonteReporterGabriel PiemonteGabriel Piemonte, a Woodlawn resident, writing coach and communications consultant who used to edit the Herald, is running for alderman of the 5th Ward again after coming in third in its 2019 contest.\u00a0\"At this moment, I feel like you've got to pour everything into this, and that's what I'm going to do,\" Piemonte said in an interview. \"It's an opportunity for the 5th Ward to reenter the fold of progressive Chicago politics and not just be kind of resting on its laurels.\"His platform had yet to be announced as of press time, but Piemonte outlined a left-of-center plan of action similar to that which he ran on last time.\u00a0Some problems remain the same; Piemonte said the 5th Ward lacks good service response infrastructure. He said he would invest in a system that allows constituents and the ward office more trackage of complaints, saying, \"If you're not getting cleanup or a pothole's not getting filled, you should know exactly why and who you can call and complain about it to.\" He said there is also room for City Council to act to ensure the city's infrastructure and bureaucracy better responds to city service needs.But the world of 2023 promises in many other ways to be worse than the world of 2019.He said Chicago Public Schools\u00a0 is \"absolutely in crisis,\" noting the teacher shortage, public policy he said does not value teachers' work and the impasse between Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration and the Chicago Teachers Union.\u00a0City Council has limited purview over education policy: the mayor appoints members of the Chicago Board of Education for the time being, though an elected school board is on the way by 2024. But Piemonte said a council speaking \"with one voice\" about Lightfoot's control of public schools, which he called \"a disaster,\" could shift the dynamic of limited legislative oversight, particularly if more progressive alderpersons are elected.The nature of crime has also changed. When Hyde Parkers used to tell him they were worried about crime, he would tell them that the neighborhood was safer than many other places and that public safety would not necessarily be a priority for that part of the ward.\"I wouldn't say that anymore,\" he said. \"I think it's reached a level of universal concern.\"\"What's going to probably peg me differently than a lot of these other candidates is we've tried more money to cops literally forever, and it doesn't yield results,\" he said. \"What does yield results, and it's almost a direct causal relationship, is economics and crime. I think you do what you can do around technology and other 'smart solutions' to increase safety, but you've got to invest economically.\"Piemonte supports a jobs guarantee, in which every Chicagoan who wants a job would get one. He wants reparations in Chicago for descendants of enslaved people, saying that\u00a0 although the city can't pay off the country's debt, it can be part of the \"patchwork of things that can be done.\"He said the University of Chicago and the Obama Foundation require cooperation from the 5th Ward alderperson.\"The Obama (Presidential) Center's not finished,\" Piemonte said. \"There's a lot of work to do, and how that gets done is going to really impart how well we work together.\"He said there is \"clear dissatisfaction\" with how it's being built, noting the passage of an advisory referendum in three 5th Ward precincts during the June primary election intended to curb cutting down more of Jackson Park\u2019s trees.\"There are consequences to having that kind of negative reception by local residents, and a lot of it can be ameliorated if there's just engagement,\" Piemonte said.For its part, the Obama Foundation held multiple community engagement meetings in the years ahead of the center\u2019s groundbreaking this past September.\u00a0Piemonte did praise the significant local hiring that has been done to build the OPC, adding that more work should be done to ensure there is continuing work after the center is built. He noted\u00a0 that the community should \u201cget some parkland back to make up for that land stolen. Closing a street isn\u2019t going to do that;\u201d referencing the roadway overhaul in Jackson Park.If elected, Piemonte said he would work to build up the ward\u2019s community institutions. As one example, he promised to bring a South Side Community Federal Credit Union, 5401 S. Wentworth Ave., to the 5th Ward.\"What matters is the jobs, and you've got to maximize the benefit of having those jobs. And that requires a kind of constellation of resources that are anchored in a financial institution,\" he said. \"I will do everything to make sure that happens, because we need a community institution with a proven track record of actually improving people's circumstances \u2014 not just engaging with them in that coldly transactional way that makes us all hate banks.\"Piemonte attributed a dearth of affordable housing options for families in the 5th Ward to rising rents and property costs related to the OPC. He said South Shore needs the same protections Woodlawn got in its Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance that Hairston, Lightfoot and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) hammered out in 2020.Notably, South Shore was cut out of this ordinance, and Piemonte said it should now be expanded, because \"We need a bold vision that really puts money down for everybody, not just a fraction, not just a pilot program, but commiserate investment. When we give big people money, we need little people to get money, too.\u201d\u00a0\"I don't believe it when any Chicago politician says they just don't have the power to make change. You're choosing not to,\" he said. \"The 5th Ward is one of the most powerful wards in the city at this point, with the Obama Center getting built, with the conversation about the Tiger Woods (golf course in Jackson Park) happening, with how people are thinking about the south lakefront \u2014 everybody is going to want the alderman of the 5th Ward to be playing ball with them.\"In terms of his candidacy, Piemonte conceded that his 2019 campaign had a weak ground game; he missed the runoff by a margin of 259 votes out of 12,953 cast. And he noted the profound vacuum that Hairston's retirement created in next year's 5th Ward race.\"There is, of course, the money you have as a sitting candidate and a friend to the head of the Cook County Democrats,\" he said, referring to Hairston's relationship with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. (In addition to serving on City Council together for more than a decade, the two are Democratic committeewomen for the 4th and 5th wards.)\u00a0Hairston's departure also allows Chicago's powerful unions cover to back a non-incumbent candidate; Piemonte thinks resources, period, from money to volunteers to organizational capacity, will be more plentiful next year than in 2019.Piemonte called former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode, who began running in the 5th Ward aldermanic election in July, \"an outstanding individual.\" He anticipates more candidates to declare now that the incumbent has announced her retirement.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.staff writerA group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.Buoys have appeared along the northern side of Promontory Point for the first time in two years.\u00a0Point swimmer Kelly Friedl said their group was so happy to find them there about two weeks ago. A majority of swimmers at the Point use their own personal buoys as well, but the buoys still serve to mark an area into which boats and other watercrafts should not enter.\u00a0Irene Tostado, Deputy Communications Director of the Chicago Park District, said they were installed by their Harbor Management company, Westrec Marina Management, at the Park District\u2019s request and \u201cat the request of the boaters.\u201d The buoys are about 50 to 75 yards offshore \u201cto provide clear safe water marks and protect boaters from drifting too close to the rocky shoreline near the Point,\u201d said Tostado.\u00a0Buoys have long been present along the southern bay , but the ones on the north side have not been installed during the first two years of the pandemic.\u00a0Tostado, in an email to the Herald, wrote that \u201cswimming is not allowed at Promontory Point and there are \u2018do not swim\u2019 signs on site to warn patrons to stay out of the water in this area for their own safety. Swimmers may enter the water through Labor Day, Monday, September 5 at the nearest beaches from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. weather/surf conditions permitting.\u201d She also noted the nearest beaches at 57th and 63rd streets, along with Oakwood Beach near 41st Street.\u00a0This has long been a point of contention between swimmers and the city, whereby the Park District does not officially acknowledge the Point as a swimming area, though many people swim there.\u00a0Previously, people have been fined for swimming at the Point, some even detained in custody for entering Lake Michigan. In 1987, the Herald reported on protests that were held by residents in response to the arrests, which increased due to drowning incidents at the Point, \u201cwhere the ban against swimming in restricted areas has not traditionally been enforced.\u201d\u00a0Jorge Sanchez, a lawyer and Point swimmer, recalled representing one person in a case against the Park District, where they dropped the charges when he started to question the statute. Others just decided to pay the fine, he said.\u00a0As recently as 2006, there were lifeguards stationed at the Point, but they were ultimately pulled by the Park District. Swimmers were again warned that if they continued they would face fines or arrests.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cResidents have been deepwater swimming from the ends of the Point south and north since the park opened in 1937,\u201d Debra Hammond, treasurer of the Promontory Point Conservancy wrote to the Herald.\u00a0\u00a0When beaches closed down during the pandemic, a number of more casual swimmers moved over to the Point to swim, which was tacitly allowed, Sanchez recalled.\u201cThey really sort of turned a blind eye to people using the Point,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201c It got really crowded sometimes because it was, I think, just about the only place on the lakefront where you could go in and not be disturbed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The long-time tradition of deepwater swimming at the Point has spawned a large community of swimmers who watch out for each other at the Point, which has coalesced into several Facebook groups.\u00a0Recently though, a number of swimmers have reported jet skis and boats crossing the buoys with greater frequency, endangering swimmers. Jak Gavriel, another Point swimmer, said \u201cI\u2019ve noticed every season there are more of them, racing closer and closer to shore.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Heather La Riviere swims at dawn every day, believing it to be safe from boats and jet skis, and said she\u2019s seen too many close calls.\u00a0With the exception of serious accidents, swimmers typically call 311, the city\u2019s non-emergency line, to report these incidents.\u00a0In July, the Herald reported on a walk that the Park District conducted with Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Ald. Hairston (5th) and the Conservancy at the Point. According to Jack Spicer, founder and president of the Conservatory, Hairston said very clearly that the buoys were necessary for safety.\u00a0He recalled that she said, \u201cpeople are swimming, people are going to swim, whether you like it or not, we need to save lives. It\u2019s dangerous that there are no buoys there.\u201d\u00a0According to Tostado, the buoys on the north side are expected to remain through October.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

  "text": "Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.ReporterAld. Leslie Hairston (5th) spoke about Mayor Harold Washington\u2019s influence on her at an event held in honor of his 100th birthday on Saturday, April 23, in Harold Washington Park.Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) will not seek reelection to a seventh term on City Council next year.\"I am retiring at the end of my term. I will have completed six terms, 24 years. That's a quarter of a century. It's time for the next chapter,\" Hairston said in an interview on Friday.Hairston, 61, said she is \"definitely not retiring for good,\" however, saying, \"I've got a lot of work in me. I've still got a lot of things that I want to do.\" She is a lawyer by profession, having previously worked in Springfield in the state attorney general's office, and said she will serve out her term as Democratic committeewoman of the 5th Ward into 2024.While she has no plans to run for another public office, she is confident that she would have won reelection had she sought it. She is currently unsure about whether she will endorse a successor, noting she is talking to potential candidates but wants to let constituents decide.\"I am not leaving the community: I am still going to be active and engaged, just in a different way,\" she said.Hairston is now the 12th alderperson who began a four-year term in 2019 but will not be serving after Election Day next April. The fact that nearly a quarter of City Council has resigned, been indicted or announced retirements or bids for public office is being taken as a reflection of acrimonious working conditions in City Hall and a greater difficulty in providing constituent services in a world ruptured by COVID-19.At a July 2021 constituents' meeting, Hairston said the council was a place she did not recognize anymore.In the interview, Hairston said she had taken several factors into consideration before announcing her retirement, with the length of her public service being foremost among them.\u00a0Hairston was born in Chicago to Reva and Lester Hairston, a Chicago Public Schools educator and a tavern owner who was the first African American in the city to buy a McDonalds franchise, respectively. She grew up in Hyde Park and South Shore, attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Loyola University Chicago School of Law.As an attorney in private practice, Hairston beat one-term incumbent Ald. Barbara Holt (5th) in 1999 in a runoff, slamming her for the state of constituent services and her ward office\u2019s unresponsiveness; Hairston\u2019s campaign ran with the slogan \"I'll Be There,\" the Tribune reported. The late former Ald. Leon Despres (5th) endorsed Hairston, who has in turn called him a mentor.Hairston had a working relationship with former Mayor Richard M. Daley, praising his administration's investments in the 5th Ward and rapport with alderpersons. She was one of five alderpersons to vote against his catastrophic deal to lease the city's parking meters and corresponding revenue for decades in exchange for an up-front payment. She said she considered running for mayor in 2010 but decided she was not ready to stop being an alderwoman.\u00a0She had frostier relations with former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, criticizing his education policy in particular. She endorsed his runoff challenger, now-U.S. Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-4th), against his reelection campaign; after news broke about the police murder of Laquan McDonald, she proposed a more stringent police oversight agency than Emanuel's Civilian Office of Police Accountability.Hairston endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, with whom she served for a decade-plus in City Council, in the 2019 mayoral election.\u00a0Hairston's own election that year would turn out to be the closest of her aldermanic career, as she was forced into a runoff by South Shore community activist William Calloway. He argued, alongside third-place finisher and former Herald editor Gabriel Piemonte, that Hairston had become inattentive to constituent needs after 20 years in office and noted that her council committee attendance was poor. Hairston won by a razor-thin margin, 50.7% of the vote to Calloway\u2019s 49.3%.Hairston has spent the past few years working to get a supermarket established in South Shore; Local Market Foods, 2101 E. 71st St., opened in 2019, after a Trader Joe's in Hyde Park, 1528 E. 55th St., opened earlier that year. In a press release announcing her retirement Friday, Hairston also touted the Obama Presidential Center, the Stony Island Arts Bank, 6760 S. Stony Island Ave., and the South Shore Starbucks, 7101 S. Stony Island Ave.An old associate of the Obamas, Hairston has been a staunch and enthusiastic supporter of the OPC that is now under construction in Jackson Park. After initial resistance, she came out in favor of an anti-displacement community benefits agreement for nearby neighborhoods during her last reelection campaign; after Mayor Lori Lightfoot took office, she worked with her administration and freshman Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) to pass the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance.\u00a0A South Shore Condo Co-Op Preservation Fund Pilot to issue grants to vulnerable owner-occupants in that neighborhood passed the council this July.The now-vice chair of the Finance Committee, Hairston prides herself on thoroughly examining every ordinance before she votes on it. She said her legislative focus on police accountability and reform has stalled against the Lightfoot administration, however. Her ordinances to codify a right to a phone call for those in Chicago Police Department custody within a specific amount of time and another to put regulations on police raids in the aftermath of the botched raid on Anjanette Young have never come up for a vote.\u00a0Hairston did, however, co-sponsor the ordinance that will create Chicago's new police accountability body, the Community Commission for Public Safety and Accountability, which will replace COPA. She worked on it with the Lightfoot administration, other alderpersons, jurists and advocates from the Civilian Police Accountability Council (CPAC) and Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability (GAPA) coalitions.\"I\u2019m glad to say that we owe Ald. Hairston a debt of gratitude for her service,\" said Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School with whom she has collaborated on police accountability policy, over email. \"There are many politicians who claim to have made a difference, she truly has done so in Chicago, consistently speaking out to serve everyday people and protect the rights of people who have been most marginalized. I am deeply grateful for her service.\"Hairston said she \"will continue the work\" she started in her final nine months of office: \"I cannot be more specific because things pop up all the time. I want to continue to work on the South Shore condominium pilot program; I would like to see that expanded into the other communities. I'm going to continue doing my job and loving every minute of it, like I do now.\"\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"The students I have supported, the (South Shore) Triathlon kids. There is so much.\"When Hairston and King, who is running for mayor, depart City Council, Hyde Park will have an entirely new aldermanic delegation, similar to how the area had an entirely new state legislative delegation in 2019. A few precincts of northwestern Hyde Park have been drawn into the 20th Ward, where the incumbent, Ald. Jeanette Taylor, has said she will run for reelection.Just one candidate, former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode, has said he is running for alderman of the 5th Ward, and no one has declared candidacy in the 4th Ward.As her long goodbye begins, Hairston said she did not enter public life for any kind of status.\"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community,\" she said. \"That is what was most important to me and what will continue to be most important to me.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comCook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle served on City Council with Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) from 1999 to 2010.\"I knew Leslie when she first ran in 1999. She's been a friend and a colleague for a very long time. For a decade, she was a friend and colleague. She's still a friend, and she, of course, is part of our 'Hyde Park Mafia' that has done so well in local politics,\" Preckwinkle said.\"I think there's been a tradition of independent, Democratic progressive \u2014 however you want to call it \u2014 leadership in the community and in the 4th and 5th wards. I think that's something of which we can all be proud, and I'm sure Leslie is proud of the two and a half decades she's served as alderman of the 5th Ward.Ald. Sophia King (4th) has served with Hairston since 2016 and issued a statement in her capacity as chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, of which Hairston was a founding member.\"Saddened but not surprised. The City Council is losing one of its most fervent and vocal leaders in the progressive space. Ald. Hairston has championed and was an early supporter for many of the progressive causes for which we are just now seeing the fruits of her labor like civilian oversight of the police. She will be missed but we will continue to carry the torch which she has valiantly held for so many years. I wish her the best in her next chapter,\" said King.Mayor Lori Lightfoot issued a statement: \"I thank Ald. Leslie Hairston for her decades of committed service to the 5th Ward and our city. Throughout her years of leadership, she was forward-thinking and always put her residents first as she tirelessly advocated for criminal justice reform, neighborhood development and so much more. I wish her all the best in this next chapter of her career and am confident we\u2019ll continue to see great things from her.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

King Drive, currently surrounded by a chain-link fence.\u00a0EditorThe Statue of the Republic, located at the intersection of East Hays and South Richards Drives in Jackson Park, has been listed in the Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement as one of the features of Jackson Park to be restored as a consequence of the construction of the Obama Presidential Center.\u00a0The equestrian statue of George Washington in Washington Park, 5531 S. King Drive, currently surrounded by a chain-link fence.\u00a0Two statues in Washington and Jackson parks that were up for review under the Chicago Monuments Project have been cleared to remain\u2014 with changes.In the fall of 2020, the commission was charged with reviewing and providing recommendations for more than 500 of Chicago\u2019s public monuments as part of a \u201cracial healing and historical reckoning project.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Forty-one city-owned works were ultimately selected for further review, including the statues of George Washington on a horse in Washington Park, 5531 S. King Drive, and \u201cThe Republic,\u201d aka the Golden Lady, 6401 S. Stony Island Ave.In the commission\u2019s report released Friday, August 19, five treatment options were determined for monuments: revising or adding narrative, modifying, re-siting to a more appropriate location, removing or replacing.Monuments under review were selected for promoting narratives of white supremacy, negative depictions of Indigenous people, memorializing figures with connections to racist acts\u2014such as slavery or genocide\u2014, presenting a one-sided view of history and creating tensions in the communities they inhabit. Treatment options varied by the severity of these depictions, connections and omissions.Per the commission, the George Washington monument was deemed historically significant, but does not acknowledge Washington\u2019s hand in slavery. It\u2019s estimated that there were more than 500 enslaved people at Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon plantation.As such, the monument was recommended for permanent artistic intervention, aka modification. The report does not describe what this intervention will entail, writing only that the interventions \u201cwill help viewers reconsider works and their subjects.\u201dThe Washington statue was designed by Daniel Chester French in 1904, who later designed the marble monument to Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. This statue is a duplicate of a 1900 Paris sculpture, and the Chicago version was commissioned by wealthy residents.\u00a0\u201cThe Republic\u201d was recommended for revising or adding narrative, which can take the form of onsite signage, online information or tours. The report notes that the purpose of additional information is to place the monument in a more informed context.\u00a0Jackson Park\u2019s Golden Lady was categorized by the commission as a monument to historic events or places\u2014in this case Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition. In the report the commission concludes that, like many sculptures originating from the world\u2019s fair, \u201cThe Republic\u201d is a tribute to the idea of progress that places the Western tradition, Western Europe and America at the apex of world civilization.The Jackson Park monument is actually a 1918 recreation of a statue presented at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, created to act as a permanent memorial to the fair on its 25th anniversary. The gold-leafed statue\u2014also designed by Daniel Chester French\u2014sits on the site of the original Jackson Park fairgrounds.\u00a0For every treatment option the report says the city will engage community members in the process. These are, however, non-binding recommendations, and it is not yet clear if city officials will follow them.Additionally, preservation or landmark designations may limit or dictate what actions can be taken to implement the removal or physical alteration to a monument or supporting infrastructure.Across the country, contemporary efforts to reevaluate\u00a0monuments for their connection to white supremacy could be said to have begun following the 2015 Mother Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, which resulted in a wave of Confederate memorial removals. The 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, also sparked a flurry of monument removals around the South.In 2020, upheaval after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis reignited the conversation around the history and purpose of public art. In Chicago, monuments to Christopher Columbus were removed following protestors' attempts to tear them down, resulting in a violent intervention by police.(Previously, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has said the move would be temporary, and as of Friday has yet to commit to taking them down permanently.)In February 2021, about six months after the commission was formed, the Chicago Monuments Project released a list of monuments up for public discussion on its website. Via the website and community meetings, the commission sought public feedback on the monuments. During this time they also solicited proposals for new works and monuments to be developed.\u00a0According to the report, about 1,700 people participated in the 36 meetings and presentations hosted by the commission. Through the website, the commission collected about 2,000 responses via a feedback form as well as 40 additional letters and emails.Statues of Christopher Columbus, Abraham Lincoln and Indigenous people\u2014such as \u201cThe Bowman\u201d and \u201cThe Spearman\u201d\u2014received the most public comment. The commission also released a survey titled \u201cAmerican Indian representation,\u201d where the bulk of respondents generally viewed depictions of Indigenous people in monuments as negative or demeaning.\u00a0In total, 13 monuments were recommended for removal and placement in storage, including all three Columbus statues, DuSable Bridge reliefs and several monuments characterizing indigenous people as violent, deceitful or submissive.With the report finished, the commission has turned to evaluating and advancing the recommended treatments for the 41 monuments, including investigating historic designation status and the structural feasibility of deinstalling or altering works.Per the report, the foundation the commission developed for receiving community feedback\u2014online or in community meetings\u2014 on monuments will be adopted by the city to be further-utilized to evaluate additional artwork in Chicago\u2019s public collection.The city will also award $50,000 grants for the planning and implementation of eight projects. These are:The Greater Chatham Initiative\u2019s Mahalia Jackson memorial\u00a0Artists and community groups for a monument to historic events and people that have shaped the Latina/x experience in the Pilsen neighborhood\u00a0The Mother Jones Heritage Project\u00a0Community organizations working to create a monument to honor Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable and his wife Kitihawa, a local Potawatomi woman\u00a0A Chicago Torture Justice Memorial in EnglewoodThe Chicago Race Riot of 1919 Commemoration Project\u00a0A Long Walk Home, for its \u201cVisibility Project\u201d proposal centering on Black women and girls\u00a0A monument to victims of gun violenceThe report notes that most of these pieces under review were created between 1893 and 1940, and share common themes that \u201cprivilege whiteness, social elites and the powerful above all people.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThese values were crystallized with the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893, which brought hundreds of sculptors, architects and artisans to Chicago to design and construct an image of Chicago that aligned with the dominant culture of the day\u2026 In this attempt to align itself with great European empires, past and present, the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition set the terms for monuments for the next 50 years.\u201dIn addition to the Golden Lady, two of the city\u2019s Columbus statues were also born out of the World\u2019s Fair; the Arrigo Park statue from the 1893 Columbian Exhibition, and the Grant Park statue from the 1933 Century of Progress.EditorHannah graduated from Columbia College Chicago in 2019.

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "title": "Ald. Sophia King running for mayor: 'We need a Chicago that's safer and stronger'",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep.

  "text": "A South Chicago Dance Theatre performanceReporterA South Chicago Dance Theatre performanceNonprofit arts organizations in and around Hyde Park won 14 of the 280 CityArts Program financial grants the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) gave out this year.Recipients include Diasporal Rhythms, 4301 S. Ellis Ave.; the Muddy Waters Mojo Museum, 4339 S. Lake Park Ave.; Intonation Music, 4434 S. Lake Park Ave.; Little Black Pearl, 1060 E. 47th St.; the Strategy for Access Foundation; the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.; Water People Theater; the Court Theatre Fund, 5535 S. Ellis Ave.; the Hyde Park School of Dance, 5650 S. Woodlawn Ave.; the South Chicago Dance Theatre; the Invisible Institute, 6100 S. Blackstone Ave.; the Community Film Workshop of Chicago (CFWC), 6200 S. Drexel Ave.; the Red Clay Dance Company, 808 E. 63rd St.; and the Definition Theatre Company.CFWC Executive Director Margaret Caples said in a statement that the $10,000 her organization received will be used to \"continue its 51-year history of providing instruction and the tools to create media art to Chicago artists and citizens.\"\"Our mission-driven programs accomplish this by providing artist-led workshops and classes, and by providing networking and screening opportunities for beginning, independent and social issue filmmakers,\" Caples continued.\u00a0Emily O'Brien, development and communications manager for Intonation, which provides year-round music classes at partner schools, parks and community organizations, said DCASE's financial support increased more than 300% this year. Intonation additionally received a multi-year grant, which helps the nonprofit with budgeting and capacity.\u00a0\u201cIntonation works with our youth to experience making music on their own terms, leading to personal growth and the enrichment of their communities,\u201d O\u2019Brien said over email. \u201cInstructors teach students the basics of each instrument and guide and empower students to take ownership of their own creation: students choose their band name, genre and set lists for a community performance.\u201dIntonation plans to use the money to pay for programming and general operating expenses.Kia Smith is the executive artistic director of the South Chicago Dance Theatre. Her father was the jazz saxophonist Jimmy Ellis, behind the Bronzeville Jazz in the Alley movement with Arthur Pops Simpson, part of the broader Black Arts Movement.Smith plans to use her $40,000 grant to help finance a two-act jazz dance performance piece, \"Memoirs of Jazz in the Alley,\" set to premier at the Auditorium Theatre next summer. She has commissioned multi-instrumentalist Isaiah Collier to create a composition for it, with some quotations from existing jazz compositions alongside new compositions. Collier will perform the piece live with an ensemble, and South Side video artist Rasean Davonte Johnson will do projections.\"It's essentially a dance concert, but with the live music and the projection design complimenting the overall picture of the show,\" Smith said. \"There's going to be 25 dancers on stage.\"Smith said the Auditorium Theatre, 50 E. Ida B. Wells Drive, is paying her to do the show, which means she won't have to pay to rent the space or designers or marketing. But her dancers are going to start rehearsing in October, and she needs to pay them. (The South Chicago Dance Theatre has performances scheduled every month this year in Chicago and on tour alongside educational programs in schools.)\u00a0\"I do a lot of fundraising; mostly foundations support us right now,\" Smith said. \"We're having our first fundraiser this season, and we want to target more individual donors as well. But foundations are our greatest source of grant income.\"There is also earned revenue from performances and educational programming. The South Chicago Dance Theatre's budget this year is $600,000; Smith estimates the music composition, set design, professional development, guest artist fees and payroll going into \"Memoirs of Jazz in the Alley\" is around $80,000, meaning the grant DCASE gave her is paying for around half of it.\"It's huge,\" Smith said. \"DCASE does a lot of good, at least in my experience with arts organizations.\"She said most foundations and government entities fund according to the size of organizations' operating budgets. \"This special grant of $40K doesn't pay attention to size; it just says, 'What do you want to do? We want to give you money to help you do it.'\" Smith said.\"This kind of project grant is what we needed in order to do this show. We couldn't do this show with just our general operating budget that we have. There's no way,\" Smith said. \"As an organization, we've never gotten something like this. So it's really exciting.\"This year's municipal budget included $26 million in new arts and culture investments, including $10 million guaranteed for the grants.The number of CityArts grants have grown from 200 last year to 280 this year, and the amount given per organization has grown from $2,000 to as much as $50,000. This year, South and West Side organizations got 45% of the grants, up from 35% last year. The DCASE cultural grants budget, $20.7 million, is almost up to pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe continued, equitable revitalization of our arts and culture scene remains essential to our ability to recover from this pandemic on a socioeconomic level,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud to increase our grant funding in support of local artists and arts organizations to advance our recovery and bring beauty and life back to our neighborhoods.\u201dMore relief grants are due to come out this year as part of the Chicago Recovery Plan to organizations not able to access other forms of federal economic support. It will include program support for artists and organizations working in neighborhoods through the city's $5 million Together We Heal Creative Place Program.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Total project costs are almost $100 million; finalists were selected based on business readiness, viability, location, design, neighborhood needs and community impact.\u00a0\u201cThese grants invest directly in Chicago\u2019s future by creating more resilient and economically vibrant communities across our city,\u201d said Mayor Lori Lightfoot in a July 18th statement. \u201cWhen our local entrepreneurs have the tools they need to grow their small businesses, they can thrive and make our neighborhoods that much more livable, functional and enjoyable.\u201dThe two area businesses were among 79 grant recipients out of more than 600 applicants.The nonprofit Carver 47 cafe, 1060 E. 47th St., opened in 2020, in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Little Black Pearl is the cultural nonprofit dedicated to fostering careers in the arts.\"The cafe and market have been growing and getting a tremendous amount of support from the community,\" said Monica Haslip, Little Black Pearl's founder and executive director. \"We have been receiving all of these requests for catering and really just didn't have the accommodations or the space to do catering.\"The $250,000 grant will be used for an expanded dining area and catering kitchen. Carver 47 will also be able to hire a team and do catering workforce development.\u00a0\"In Little Black Pearl, our mission is to teach the connection between art education and business,\" Haslip said. \"A part of what we are doing now through the market is expanding the work that we're doing in the culinary arts and to really focus on food justice and food security.\u201d\u00a0Part of that effort, Haslip said, is Carver 47\u2019s healthy food-focused cafe menu and market offerings, expanding community access to nutritious meals. The market serves an average of 130 to 150 people a day.\u201cWe consider the work that we're doing in there connected to a larger body of work around narrative change and racial healing,\" Haslip said.\u00a0The cafe's namesake is George Washington Carver, the Tuskegee Institute agricultural scientist and environmentalist.\u00a0Haslip said the cafe's \"vision for that component of our work is around connecting and expanding the narrative about African American icons, and particularly those who have a connection to the arts.\" Carver was also a painter \u2014 his work was displayed at the World's Columbian Exhibition, and while most of them burned in a 1947 fire after his death, they were preserved in documentary footage filmed during his lifetime. His artistic side is a focus of Carver 47.\"A lot of the things that are connected to our vision, which is connecting people to the arts, Dr. Carver represents,\" Haslip said.\u00a0And the cafe is used to train people; one of the Little Black Pearl high school graduates who trained there now works there full-time. In total, eight people work there full-time and four work part-time. Haslip said Carver 47's catering component portends more opportunities for workforce development.Carver 47 is preparing to apply for the permit and has finished designing the new kitchen and expanding dining area. Haslip said she hopes to get all the construction done by the end of the year, with a grand opening around 12 months from now.\u00a0\"As we come back into operations after COVID, many of us have had to reimagine what we offer to the community and make sure it's in alignment with what we need,\u201d said Haslip. \u201cBased on the success of the market, we believe we're on the right track and this catering kitchen will help us create more jobs and more opportunities for the neighborhood.\"In Woodlawn, Urban Market Exchange founder Quandra Speights said she is happy that this year\u2019s grantees are diverse, noting that it gets more people to the table.\"I'm often seeing the same people get these same grants,\" she said. \"I saw a lot of new faces this time.\"She got slightly more than $1.2 million. The plan is for the makers\u2019 space to help small business owners scale and grow their business with specialized equipment, workshops and business support.Speights, a non-practicing attorney with a master's degree in business and a background in corporate human relations, has experience working with startup incubator Sunshine Enterprises, 503 E. 61st St., but she said she realized businesses are often going back into the basements and garages after they complete entrepreneurship coaching. She attributed this to owners struggling with scaling.\"They don't have the money to go into brick-and-mortar. They can't afford the overhead. They can't afford the lights and all that comes with brick-and mortar,\" Speights said. \"But that doesn't negate the fact that a lot of them still want to scale their business.\"When the state was putting orders in for face masks at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Speights said there were home businesses that could have competed for those contracts but lacked a facility, like a co-working space to do the work.\u00a0\"With maybe one or two other people they could have brought with them, they could have produced 5,000 masks in a few hours. They could have met that (contract), and made their money,\" she said. \"They don't have to actually get a studio space in the maker space, but they have equipment here that they can go utilize.\"When up and running, hopefully by the spring of 2023, Urban Market Exchange will have light manufacturing equipment; Speights described it as a \"mini manufacturing facility.\" One room with sewing machines, another room with laser, T-shirt and 3D printers and laser cutters, and two studios, one for recording podcasts and another for photography, with cameras available for rent.\u00a0Speights is working with corporate philanthropic departments to get discounted equipment, and she is still looking for additional capital funding. The 7,000-square-foot building, 525 E. 67th St., is a gut rehab. Speights hopes getting a loan won't be as \"arduous\" now as it has been before for projects in communities of color; she thinks she needs another $600,000.Though she previously struggled to obtain loans from banks \u2014despite having multiple degrees, money saved and investment properties\u2014 Speights remains hopeful that new initiatives to support small, female-owned or minority-owned businesses will change that.\u00a0In the meantime, Speights added that without this grant, \u201cthis project would be dead in the water.\"The 26 recipients of Community Development Grants issued in May included the Muddy Waters Mojo Museum, 4339 S. Lake Park Ave., and Friend Health, 700 E. 63rd St.The deadline for the final round of grants is Aug. 19, with information at\u00a0chicago.gov/chirecoverygrant.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "A group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.PhotographerA group of second-year University of Chicago students sits on the capstones of a section of wave-damaged Promontory Point on Friday afternoon, May 20th.The repair and restoration of Promontory Point has been a subject of debate and contention in Hyde Park for more than 20 years. And as of last week, a representative from Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s office told the Herald that the city will support a preservation approach to restoring the Point\u2019s limestone revetment.\u201cThe Park District, along with the Army Corps and Chicago Department of Transportation have a role in ensuring that Promontory Point continues to remain the community asset that it has always been,\u201d said a spokesman from the mayor\u2019s office in a July 18th statement to the Herald. \u201cWe are committed to working with the community on a design that properly addresses the historic nature of the Point\u2026 We are committed to a preservation-based approach and there will be extensive outreach to the community during the planning and design process.\"This statement comes more than a month after Lightfoot\u2019s comments regarding the Point\u2019s preservation sparked outrage among some advocates. In\u00a0an early June interview, Mayor Lori Lightfoot was first asked by the Herald if her office supported preserving the limestone or replacing it with concrete steps, as is in place along most of the lakefront. Though she said liked the way the limestone looks, Lightfoot added, \u201cI don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away.\"\u00a0The reaction was swift. The following week, the Point Preservation Conservancy (a private group advocating for a preservation approach to the design and restoration of the Point) published an\u00a0open letter to the mayor criticizing this statement. They also requested that Lightfoot join them for a walk around the Point.Lightfoot took the conservancy up on that invitation, \u2014accompanied by Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) and the mayor\u2019s Chief Engagement Officer Martina Hone\u2014 joining the conservancy for an hour-long walk on July 4th, shortly after participating in Hyde Park\u2019s 4th on 53rd Parade. According to members of the conservancy, Lightfoot and company were shown the group\u2019s plans for repairing the limestone steps and \u201casked good questions.\u201d\u00a0In the July 18th statement, the Mayor\u2019s spokesman said of the walk, \u201cThe Mayor was grateful for the opportunity to visit the Point with the Promontory Point Conservancy and hear their concerns directly.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0This walk was the latest effort in a renewed push for the Point\u2019s preservation, which was reinvigorated in 2019 following the Chicago Park District\u2019s announcement of a new shoreline study that would include Promontory Point. Over the last three years, a number of different studies have been proposed to explore the cost of rehabilitating the limestone or replacing it entirely, leaving residents concerned about the park's future.In October of that year, the Park District entered into a contract with SmithGroup for a report \"providing design and engineering services for the development of the first phase of a Lakefront Strategic Action Plan,\" which includes Promontory Point. This report has not yet been made public.In July of 2021, Michael Padilla, project manager for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Chicago region,\u00a0reported that $500,000 had been allocated in President Biden\u2019s 2022 budget for a different Chicago shoreline study that would also include a new design plan for Promontory Point.\u00a0Before the funds for Biden's 2022 budget had been appropriated, however, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D) and Lightfoot announced in January of this year that $3 million in funding had been allocated via Biden\u2019s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to produce another shoreline study of the Chicago lakefront. This study, titled the General Reevaluation Report (GRR) would also include Promontory Point.Subsequently, in May of this year, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) made her request for an earmark of $550,000 in Biden's 2023 budget to fund an \"independent third-party study to determine a preferred preservation approach for the design of the Promontory Point Shoreline Project with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\"\u00a0The overlapping jurisdictional efforts have created confusion among residents and advocates about the goals of the efforts, and their impact on promoting or interfering with a preservation approach to the design and repair of the park. According to the mayor\u2019s spokesman, however, the GRR study will not conflict with Kelly\u2019s independent third-party study.\u201cThe Park District and Department of Transportation support a preservation approach to Promontory Point, which the Kelly independent third-party study will help to advance. The GRR proceeding forward will not make any design decisions with respect to the Point,\u201d reads the July 18th statement.\u00a0The spokesperson added that all involved city agencies will await the outcome of the proposed Kelly study before making decisions about Promontory Point, and that \u201cthe Chicago Park District will engage the community before finalizing a plan to restore Promontory Point.\"\u00a0In response, the Promontory Point Conservancy released a statement of their own, thanking the mayor\u2019s office for publicly committing to a preservation-approach for the park\u2019s limestone revetment.\u00a0\u201cWe are pleased too that the Mayor is committed to serious community input in the preservation study. This makes a preservation approach at the Point a win-win for the City and for the community,\u201d the conservancy wrote. \u201cWe look forward to working with the agencies to craft a creative, world-class ADA adaptation so all have easy access to the restored revetment and the water. Thank you, Mayor Lightfoot, for supporting preservation of the limestone and taking demolition off the table.\u201dPhotographer",

Founded by Woodlawn resident Marquinn Gibson and supported through a city grant, 7323 Chicago Cafe will open later this month with a selection of drinks, salads and sweet treats.\u00a0Owner Marquinn Gibson said he has been in the kitchen from a young age, and was inspired to open the cafe by his grandmother, who migrated to the South Side of Chicago during the Great Migration. \u201cMen in my family (also) cook really well,\u201d he said, \u201c I took something from everybody as I went, and I\u2019ve just gotten curious and honed my skills over the years.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This past fall, Gibson was running a catering business that he founded in 2020 \u2014 right when the pandemic started \u2014 when his friends told him about a new city grant to establish a physical location.\u00a0In October 2021, the Park District announced a grant program called the Alfresco Dining Grant, which aims to encourage new outdoor dining concession concepts that \u201ccreate a destination location for consumers and increase the amount of time spent in the parks.\u201d This park-specific grant is an extension of Mayor Lori E. Lightfoot\u2019s broader Chicago Alfresco, through the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) and Choose Chicago.According to Stephanie Hatch, general manager for the program, 75% of the Alfresco Dining Grant funds were allotted for areas that have a lack of outdoor dining spaces, primarily on the South and West sides. The program is administered by the Chicago Park District and the city, as well as its concession manager Unison Consulting, Inc (\u201cUCG\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0When applying for the grant, Flying Squirrel Park was Gibson\u2019s first choice for a location, since he lives close by. After getting the grant this spring, he has used both it and his own funds to complete the project. Inspiration for the container space comes in-part from Bronzeville\u2019s Boxville community, whom Gibson has worked closely with to understand how to run lights and electricity inside the box.\u00a0Gibson said his goals for the cafe are to build community within his own neighborhood and provide fresh, healthy food to residents.\u00a0Menu items will include juices, smoothies and lemonades, as well as paninis, wraps and salads. For sweets, gourmet ice cream sandwiches such as peach cobbler cookies containing vegan vanilla ice cream will also be offered. Gibson also hopes to have outdoor seating.\u00a0\u201cThe idea is for you to be able to grab and go if you want\u2026 or if you just want to sit and chill, read your book in the park, do some work in the park, while you grab a quick bite,\u201d he said.During Gibson\u2019s interview with the Herald, a driver stopped their car to ask about the box. After he explained the incoming cafe, the driver responded excitedly. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting a lot of that,\u201d Gibson said.For some neighbors, however, the reception has been less favorable. Mike Medina, president of the Woodlawn Avenue Block Club who lives across the street from the park, said that he and his neighbors did not receive notice about the box.\u00a0Medina added that residents have long been concerned about pedestrian safety at that corner, recounting a recent collision in which \u201cone car hit the fence that\u2019s immediately adjacent to the park benches and water fountain.\u201d It\u2019s only a matter of time, he speculated, before a vehicle leaves the roadway and ends up in the park.\u00a0Beyond safety, Medina noted that the park itself could use some upgrades, such as a refurbished entrance and egress, as well as the land regraded. The uneven ground is affecting the box too, which has to be propped up on one side with a brick.\u00a0\u00a0The grand opening is tentatively scheduled for Saturday, July 30th from 12 p.m. - 6 p.m. at 6600 S. Woodlawn Ave., and will feature a DJ, outdoor games, face painting for kids and giveaways.staff writerZoe Pharo is a graduate of Carleton College.

If the pilot is successful, it will expand to other properties in South Shore.This fund comes at a time when the ongoing construction of the Obama Presidential Center and renovations of Jackson and South Shore parks are heightening concerns about gentrification.Both Lightfoot and Hairston noted the large number of South Shore residents that are older and on fixed incomes. The lakefront neighborhood has a number of single-family homes and multi-unit buildings with condominiums and apartments; many of the Black condominium owners are at risk of conversion because of their inability to pay for deferred maintenance or get loans with longer terms than five to seven years.From the council floor, Hairston said the pilot was something she had been working on for two decades, noting that the idea came about during the widespread conversion of apartments to condominiums during the 2000s housing bubble.\"Then the market crashed in 2008, so then we had a big exodus (of buyers),\" she said. \"As we move in these times, we have to find a way to keep the people who are our taxpayers, who are our voters, who are our teachers, our nurses, our plumbers, our electricians, our postal carriers \u2014 who have saved their money and purchased \u2014 stay in their homes and and their condos when good things are happening in the neighborhood.\"As we know as people age and the income does not match the rate of inflation, then we need to do something to help our residents to stay in their housing.\u201dBut the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition said the fund falls short of community needs. At a City Hall press conference Wednesday morning ahead of the vote, members of the coalition spoke out against the proposal, noting that a portion of the South Shore fund comes from the city\u2019s Affordable Housing Opportunity Fund.\u201cOur coalition knows that displacement is a reality for renters, condo owners and homeowners,\u201d said Chinella Miller, an organizer with Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization (KOCO). \u201cBut the mayor is taking from one group to give to another. This is not equitable policy.\u201dAccording to data collected by the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, about 77% of South Shore residents are renters.Organizers also said the city has moved too slow on guaranteeing protections for renters at risk of displacement.\u201cThe city said this is just the first step. Well, it's been nine months since we announced our demand and seven years since the Obama Presidential Center was announced,\u201d said South Shore resident Brandon Patterson. \u201cRents have been going up, real estate speculation is through the roof and people are already being displaced.\u201dIn November 2021, the CBA Coalition released a list of demands and policy recommendations to safeguard against displacement. Among the demands are bookmarking city-owned vacant lots in the neighborhood for affordable housing development and allocating money to programs such as the Chicago Low-Income Trust Fund, to subsidize affordable units.Since then, Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) member Savannah Brown said the coalition has been frustrated by what they said is minimal communication from the mayor\u2019s office, DOH and Obama Foundation regarding this issue.\u201cThey have not been communicating with the CBA Coalition and, again, the CBA Coalition has been fighting against displacement for people on the South Side,\u201d said Brown.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Chinella Miller of the\u00a0Kenwood-Oakland Community Organization (KOCO) speaks at a press conference with the CBA Coalition ahead of Chicago City Council's Wednesday meeting, July 20.ReporterChicago City Council greatly expanded the number of city properties eligible for a transit-oriented development (TOD), a program that incentivizes building more mixed-use developments\u2014 such as housing, offices, retail and parks\u2014 within a short walking distance of public transit.\u00a0Per the Connected Communities Ordinance, passed in council Wednesday (36-10), TOD incentives will be extended to a standard four-block radius around rail stations and two-block radius around certain bus stations.\u00a0Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) supported the ordinance; Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) missed the meeting due to illness.TOD benefits include parking relief, which eliminates minimum parking standards and puts a ceiling on the maximum number of parking spaces that can be built, and a density bonus that developers can receive to build more square footage without having to pay a fee.Much of Hyde Park and the surrounding area was included under a 2019 TOD pilot that only included market-rate homes. During the pilot, TOD projects have been built at the terminus of the CTA Green Line in Woodlawn, and in January 2021, the mixed-use 43 Green project, next to the 43rd Street Green Line station and along the 43 bus route in Bronzeville, won Chicago Plan Commission approval in Bronzeville.Nevertheless, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office cited a 2020 analysis of developments that accessed TOD incentives between 2016 and 2019 that found that 90% of TOD projects were built in the North and Northwest sides and downtown, including the West Loop.\u00a0Bolstering transit-adjacent investments in the immediate area, several local CTA bus routes have been made eligible for TOD benefits under the new ordinance: the 2 Hyde Park Express, the 3 King Drive, the 4 Cottage Grove, the 6 Jackson Park Express, the 15 Jeffery Local, the 26 South Shore Express, the 28 Stony Island, the 43 43rd, the 47 47th, the 55 Garfield, the 63 63rd, the 67 67th-69th-71st and the 71 71st/South Shore.In a statement about the ordinance, Department of Housing (DOH) Commissioner Marisa Novara said that development near transit maximizes housing affordability and accessibility, as well as improves pedestrian safety and better connects people to their jobs. \"The passage of the Connected Communities Ordinance strengthens our commitment to development near transit that prioritizes people, safety and affordability, and is a big step toward more equitable outcomes by race and income across the city.\u201dThe ordinance also includes pedestrian safety standards on new construction near rail stations, incentives for putting in affordable units in TOD projects and protections against the loss of two- and three-flats near transit in communities facing displacement pressures by requiring special permission to replace multi-family homes with single-family homes.Steven Vance, an urban planner and the founding CEO of Chicago Cityscape, a real estate information platform, said that the ordinance\u2019s cost-reductions for developers \u2014such as by not requiring parking\u2014 could translate to savings for residents.\u201cThe idea is, Chicago has pretty good transit, we should allow more people to live near that good transit, so let's make it cheaper to build there,\u201d said Vance. \u201c(The ordinance) allows property owners to build more units than NIMBYism or zoning rules would otherwise allow, and require them to not build too much parking because cheap or free parking causes a lot of unnecessary trips by car, which ruins the pedestrian-oriented nature that the area around transit-dense neighborhoods should have.\u201dAdditionally, WTTW reports that an anti-aldermanic prerogative provision that would have allowed three-unit residences to be built in wealthy neighborhoods near transit hubs without City Council permission got stripped during the ordinance's committee hearing.The council also passed a measure creating the South Shore Condo Preservation Pilot Program, which will give $5 million yearly in grants to owner-occupants for repairs and loans to homeowner associations for maintenance.\u00a0The three-year pilot, which will utilize the DOH Troubled Buildings Initiative and the Chicago Community Loan Fund (CCLF), is beginning with the building at 6931-39 South Crandon Avenue.

It failed 18-26; King and Hairston voted for it, having pledged support for it last month out of concerns about equity.According to a January report from the University of Illinois-Chicago, a disproportionate number of tickets issued to drivers who broke traffic laws have come from red light and speed cameras in majority-Black and brown communities, and low-income neighborhoods.That same report, however, also associates the city\u2019s speed cameras (analyzing a period prior to the 6 to 9 mph ticket ordinance) with a 15% decrease in traffic fatalities and serious injuries. (The report examined the safety-impact of 101 speed camera locations from 2015-2017, comparing the rate of traffic accidents near the cameras to a period from 2010-2012, prior to when the cameras were installed.)\u00a0Deviating from local Alds., South Side Ald. Michelle Harris (8th) voted against the measure, noting pedestrian deaths in her ward due to speeding vehicles.\u00a0\"Speed kills,\" she said, recalling witnessing a pedestrian's death on Cottage Grove Ave., which she called an \u201cunofficial highway.\u201dThere are two cameras locally, both near Washington Park: at 536 E. Morgan Drive and 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave. Motorists caught speeding by the cameras are sent $35 fines.The council also passed an ordinance that would allow the Chicago Police Department to impound cars that have been used in drag races and other reckless, showoff driving and a revision to the city's ethics ordinance that ups the maximum fines the Board of Ethics can levy, expands conflict-of-interest provisions and disallows former alderpersons from being able to access the council floor to lobby incumbents.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "(Left to right) Sean Harden, Leon Walker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush and Samir Mayekar cut the ribbon for Friend Health's new Woodlawn Health Center, July 8, 2022.Editor(Left to right) Sean Harden, Leon Walker, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush and Samir Mayekar cut the ribbon for Friend Health's new Woodlawn Health Center, July 8, 2022.After 25 years in Hyde Park, Friend Health is opening its new headquarters and flagship medical clinic in Woodlawn. Located at the corner of Cottage Grove Avenue and 63rd Street, Friend Health\u2019s new facility is expected to alleviate the area\u2019s severe shortage of health care providers when it officially opens in late-July.During the facility\u2019s July 8 ribbon-cutting, Friend Health CEO Verneda Bachus said the $43 million clinic will provide comprehensive primary care: family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, pediatrics and a pharmacy. Mammograms and ultrasounds will start being offered, as will a same-day-need clinic.\u201cThis is a day that will change the future of Woodlawn because it will change thousands of lives on the South Side of Chicago,\u201d said Bachus. She added that Friend Health intends for the facility to serve \u201cas a hub for community wellbeing\u2026 a place where the people of Woodlawn and the South Side of Chicago come, not only for healing, but to maintain and support healthy lifestyles.\u201dBachus estimates that the new clinic will serve 35,000 patients annually. Friend Health is also a federally qualified health center, meaning it receives federal funding and must provide affordable treatment regardless of insurance, financial or immigration status.At Friday\u2019s ribbon-cutting, Friend Health Board Chairman Sean Harden \u2014a lifelong South Sider\u2014 attested that Woodlawn residents have long lacked access to quality health care. He said this lack of access has contributed to poorer health outcomes compared to neighboring communities.\u201cThere's one study that suggests that just a few miles north of here, your life expectancy is 85-years-old. But for my residents, their life expectancy is 75-year- old,\u201d said Harden. \u201cThat can't go on. And today marks the first step in changing those statistics.\u201dIn addition to expanding health care access, Harden said the facility is expected to create 250 new permanent jobs.\u00a0After the project at\u00a0 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave. was first announced in May of 2020, Friend Health sought and received $8 million in tax increment financing (TIF) money for its development. In July of 2021, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) also sought and received $250,000 for the project in the appropriations process.\u00a0Rep. Rush also attended the event, along with Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) who stressed community-involvement throughout the project\u2019s development, was unable to attend due to an illness.\u201cFor far too long, communities like Woodlawn have gone without resources\u2026 There should never be a time in one of the wealthiest cities in the world, where the life expectancy of Black people in our city is 10 years less than any other demographic,\u201d said Lightfoot. \u201cWith the grand-opening of Friend Health\u2019s Woodlawn Health Center, residents of Woodlawn and others from the surrounding communities will finally receive the local access to vital health care that they have always deserved, and needed.\u201d\u00a0Lightfoot added that the $43 million center was also awarded by a $2.5 million Chicago Community Development Grant in May of this year, a development grant through the city\u2019s Covid-19 economic\u00a0 recovery plan.The project\u2019s developer, DL3 Realty, has been a key player in the development of the corner at 63rd and Cottage Grove over the past several years. DL3 Realty\u2019s managing partner Leon Walker said at Friday\u2019s ribbon-cutting that the Friend Health development is part of the firm\u2019s \u201cfour-corner strategy\u201d to revitalize the area.Walker said the team is now moving onto construction of the second-phase of its medical campus: a new 15,000 square foot annex building across the street, to be completed in the fall of 2022. This second building will house parking, retail and a dental suite for adults and children, serving Medicaid, Medicare, no-insurance and commercial patients.Friend Health was founded in 1997 by the merger of two University of Chicago clinics. It currently operates six locations on Chicago\u2019s South Side including Back of the Yards, Gage Park/West Englewood, Hyde Park/Washington Park, Woodlawn, West Elsdon and a school-based health center in Bronzeville. The low-income provider serves about 47,000 patients annually across these clinics, 96% of which are Black or Hispanic, while about three-quarters are under the poverty line.\u00a0\u201cThese services are a literal lifeline for individuals and families regardless of their ability to pay, their immigration status, whether or not they have insurance; none of that matters, because we all deserve to have access to quality health care,\u201d said Harden. \u201cWhether it's being responsive to critical life saving interventions, annual checkups or preventative care, that will all be here for everyone to take advantage of.\u201dEditorHannah graduated from Columbia College Chicago in 2019.

In the June 9 interview, Lightfoot said, \u201cWe're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers\u2026 Of course I love the way (the limestone) looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away.\"As a response, the Conservancy \u2014who have long advocated against proposals to replace the limestone with concrete\u2014 wrote in a letter to Herald on June 20, addressed to Lightfoot: \u201cWe would be pleased and honored to walk the Point with you sometime soon so you can see the condition of the revetment for yourself.\u201dAnd so they did. According to the Conservancy, they walked the Point\u2019s shore for an hour. Martina Hone, the mayor\u2019s Chief Engagement Officer, tweeted later that day of the visit: \u201cMayor recently shared how much she loved Promontory Point.

Leslie Hairston (5th),\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, Lt. Gov.\u00a0Juliana Stratton and Ald. King (4th) lead the 4th on 53rd parade on Monday, July 4, 2022.On Monday morning, floats, marchers and politicians gathered in the parking lot of the Hyde Park Bank, 1525 E. 53rd St., preparing to step off for the annual 4th on 53rd parade. But shortly after 10:15 a.m., news broke that there had been a mass shooting at an Independence Day Parade in Highland Park, a northern suburb of Chicago, which left several dead and dozens injured.\u00a0With marchers queued up and scores of families lining 53rd Street, the parade organizing committee made the decision to continue with the event.\u00a0\"It was a pretty snap decision,\" said parade committee member David White. \"It shook us to our core\u2026 But we felt that it was important for us to continue.\"Though Governor JB Pritzker left the march for Highland Park, a number of elected officials remained; U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D), Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and local Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th). \u201cWe had the opinion that this was an isolated incident,\u201d said White, adding that the politicians\u2019 security details were not concerned about a threat in Hyde Park.And so parade preparations continued. Politicians and community members mingled and sought shade under one of the few trees in the bank parking lot, while the Kenwood Academy Marching Broncos arrived with its brass and percussion booming down S. Lake Park Ave. W.\u00a0Nearby, kids rode around on decorated bikes, forming the parade\u2019s iconic Bike Brigade, while a group of parents distributed signs reading \"Stop Gun Violence.\"Families gather outside the Hyde Park Bank, 1525 E. 53rd St., to watch the 4th on 53rd parade, Monday, July 4, 2022.It was warm and very humid, but a breeze came off the lake providing some relief. In another corner of the parking lot, Mayor Lightfoot posed with the Kenwood Marching Broncos and spoke with the press.\"Democracy, I think, is really on the precipice,\" said Lightfoot. \"But the Fourth of July and thinking about everything that's happened from our origins to where we are now, we have a lot to be proud of. But we also know our journey towards justice is not over.\"As a standard bearer carrying the U.S. flag, Girl Scout Troop 20089 member and Kenwood rising senior Ilona Edstrom has been in the vanguard of the parade for at least four years.\"I think it's a good way to get the community back together. We had so much time apart, \" said Edstrom as she waited for the parade to step off. \" There's a lot of stuff happening in the nation\u2026\u00a0 I think it's important to stay strong as a community.\"The parade kicked off at 11 a.m., with Grand Marshall Preckwinkle leading the way. Lt. Gov. Stratton, Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner Kim Du Buclet and Alds. King and Hairston were at her side. Though they smiled and waved at the crowd, the politicians were understandably a bit subdued, a little less effusive in their engagement with the public than during past parades.\u00a0Members of the Broken Arrow Horseback Riding Club wave to spectators during the 4th on 53rd parade, Monday, July 4, 2022.\u00a0The parade flowed along its usual route (south on Lake Park Ave. to 55th St.,\u00a0east on 55th St. to E. Hyde Park Blvd., north on E. Hyde Park Blvd. to 53rd St. and then west on 53rd St.) into Nichols Park, where marchers and spectators alike enjoyed magic shows, musical performances, horse rides, face painting, refreshments and more.According to White, parade participants said the number of spectators lining 53rd street seemed much higher than in past years. Though the community celebrations pressed on in spite of the tragedy in Highland Park, White noted that future events may need to proceed with caution.\"What do you say to mad men who are willing to do anything to hurt?\" asked\u00a0 White. \"I think every parade now is going to have to really consider this, and bake in some sort of plan for the unthinkable.\"Your comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.\u00a0ReporterThe Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.\u00a0Local and state elected officials are aghast at the United States Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which has ended the constitutional, nationwide right to an abortion.Abortion rights are still protected in Illinois, however, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said today that he would call the General Assembly into a special session to further protect that right after the court issued its decision.\"We knew this day was coming,\" he said at a press conference in Rogers Park. \"The extremists on the Supreme Court have made an abhorrent decision, one rooted in partisanship, leaving an indelible stain on our nation.\"\"To the right-wing officeholders who today are cheering the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: get your iron boot off women's necks! Hop off your high horse and know that what you\u2019re calling a 'celebration of life' today will actually lead to death \u2014 the death of women in abusive situations, the death of women whose health is at risk, the death of women and girls who will still seek abortions\u2014ones that are unsafe and performed by unqualified back-alley butchers.\"He was non-committal about what legislation the General Assembly may consider beyond measures ensuring there are enough medical professionals to care for the people expected to come to Illinois to get abortions.WTTW reports that other bills under consideration may be ones to strengthen protections for abortion care and to provide resources for people coming to the state for abortions. Senators could also pass a bill to prevent state officials from disciplining providers for providing abortions.Mayor Lori Lightfoot, in her own news conference, threatened lawsuits against states who would punish people coming to Illinois for abortions \u2014 threatening Indiana for allowing guns to be trafficked across the state line if a precedent exists for people to sue those who come to Illinois for abortions \u2014 and promised to protect abortion rights in Chicago.Lightfoot, Chicago's first openly gay mayor, has previously stressed the vulnerability of federal LGBTQ rights if abortion rights fell.Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said the court\u2019s decision will not prevent women from getting abortions.\u201cWhat this decision will do is force women to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, or seek dangerous and unregulated means for an abortion,\u201d Preckwinkle said in a statement. \u201cThis decision will disproportionately impact women of color and poor women, like all policies built on inequity. It also removes all women's right to choose what happens to their own bodies. Under this ruling, contraception, same-sex marriage, and other rights are now under attack. Illinois and Cook County will remain a safe haven for women, but as we deal with this harsh reality, we must continue to strengthen our resolve and fight back.\u201dState Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) called the decision \u201ca threat to broader fights for justice everywhere\u201d and \u201ca gateway for the far right to start attacking so many important rights we have today,\u201d one that \u201cwill not reduce abortions, but only further penalize working class communities especially working class Black and Brown communities.\u201d\u201cIllinois continues to lead the country when it comes to protecting the reproductive rights of our residents, and I know we will be a welcoming, safe place for people from hostile states that may be seeking an abortion,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to the organizers and the movement who demanded that Illinois be a leader on reproductive justice, and I am committed to working with them and my colleagues to expand people\u2019s rights in Illinois, not restrict them. I want to be clear that this is the beginning of a much broader movements\u2019 plan to attack marginalized communities and we must not back down from this challenge, but stand up and step out.\u201dIn a statement released from his mayoral campaign, state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th) called the court's decision \"rooted in misogyny and extreme political views.\"He tied health care access to women, and particularly Black women, being on a path to economic opportunity, linking that with his co-sponsorship of Illinois' Reproductive Health Care Act. He promised to fight for women as mayor of Chicago.U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) noted that the decision will hurt poor, rural and disadvantaged women in conservative states the most, and added that \u201cit opens the door for a future GOP-controlled Congress to pass a national ban.\u201d\u201cIf the conservative pro-life movement really cared about the lives of children, they would be supporting mothers and children instead of prohibiting healthcare access and oppressing women,\u201d Rush said in a statement.In an interview, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) said Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, who voted with the majority, should never have been appointed to the Supreme Court. Senate Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama from appointing Justice Antonin Scalia's successor after his death and then refused to follow a precedent they set after the 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\"I hope that people realize that elections have consequences,\" Kelly said. \"If people don't vote, this is what happens.\"In a statement, Ald. Sophia King (4th), a former vice chair of Planned Parenthood Chicago, said pro-abortion rights people would not retreat but double-down and \"use this moment to galvanize and expand our base.\"\"The conservative movement is not done,\" she said. \"We expect rulings that will curtail or outright gut programs like affirmative action, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and other hard-fought rights and programs that have moved this country forward. This attack undermines all of those and more. This is why it is so important that we come together and use every vehicle possible to protect our rights. Let's start by leveraging our voting power.\"Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th), an attorney, called back to the 20th century civil rights battles and said they are continuing today.\"To be a woman, and to be a woman of color \u2014 there's just no end to the attacks,\" Hairston said. \"They keep on coming.\"\"It's going to impact Black and brown people most, as has every law that's been enacted. What the Supreme Court did today is unheard of,\" she said. \"Taking away people's rights? And while I haven't read the opinion yet, Justice Clarence Thomas alluded to the fact that nobody has the right to privacy, so it's very serious to me. Are we going to start tagging women from other states to make sure that they don't cross state lines? What exactly does it mean and at what point is it enough? This is not only deadly, but it takes us back centuries.Hairston added that people \u201cneed to be organizing more than ever. We are back to the '60s\u2026 Anybody who was born in the '80s, '90s or even the 2000s has no idea what this means.\"Pritzker was similarly dire.\"They've just taken away rights from more than half of the population of the United States,\" he said. \"Is this serious? Is this one of the worst things that's happened in our lifetimes, that the Supreme Court has done? I've been alive 57 years. They haven't taken away rights in my entire lifetime, and they're aiming to take away more rights.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comUChicago Medicine, the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine's teaching hospital, issued the following statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization:\"As an academic health system based in Illinois, where abortion remains legal, and the only hospital-based abortion provider on Chicago\u2019s South Side, the University of Chicago Medicine plays an essential role for the community and for patients needing high-quality care.\"Our organization has a lengthy record of providing high-quality, evidence-based reproductive healthcare and a strong reputation of training the brightest future physicians to offer these clinical services to patients. This involves a broad range of medical care, including abortion, contraception/family planning, fertility treatment, care for general and high-risk pregnancies, and miscarriage management. These are common services that are integral to obstetrical and gynecological medicine and a vital part of comprehensive medical education for physicians in training.\"Our health system remains committed to providing the full spectrum of safe reproductive healthcare and is preparing for how we can best serve patients who travel to Illinois to seek our care and services.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "The speed camera at 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.ReporterThe speed camera at 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.The City Council delayed a vote on an ordinance that would end the $35 tickets Chicagoans pay if traffic cameras catch them going six to 10 mph over the speed limit. Alds. Sophia King (4th) and Leslie Hairston (5th) voted for the ordinance in committee on June 21, and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) also says she supports it.Mayor Lori Lightfoot's council allies used a parliamentary tool at the body's June 22 meeting to postpone a vote until the council's next meeting, scheduled for July 20.The speeding tickets went into effect as part of the mayor's 2021 budget, which King and Hairston voted for and Taylor voted against.Even if the ordinance passes the council \u2014 it passed the Finance Committee by a one-vote margin \u2014 Lightfoot could veto the ordinance.At the committee meeting, King said ordinance supporters do not want to reduce revenue or safety. She noted that the ordinance doesn't change the speed limit, just the threshold at which point people who are speeding will get a ticket.\"I just don't want to balance the budget on the backs of those who are least able to afford it,\" she said. \"In terms of equity, I think we definitely need to look at that.\" She compared DuSable Lake Shore Drive to 'the wild, wild West\" and said there are more opportunities for revenue and safety.According to a January report from the University of Illinois-Chicago, a disproportionate number of tickets issued to drivers who broke traffic laws have come from red light and speed cameras in majority-Black and brown communities, and low-income neighborhoods.\"I really want us to look at real equitable and safe solutions,\" King said. \"There are lots of places in this city that would be more equitable, that wouldn't just be in Black and brown communities, and we could make the city safer and make more revenue.\"Hairston said at the committee meeting everyone is committed to making sure people are safe.\"I see us collecting tickets seven days a week year-round,\" she said. \"We cannot say that we are not balancing the budget on the backs of the people, particularly the backs of the Black and the brown people, because that's where the data shows.\"People who are driving crazy will continue to drive crazy, and guess what? They will be ticketed, because they should be ticketed. So there's no question. I don't understand why there's no cameras in Lincoln Park. It's quite the assumption that people in Lincoln Park don't speed.\"Per the city's speed camera portal, the nearest cameras are located in the Bucktown and Lakeview neighborhoods.Lightfoot issued a statement after the meeting, saying in part, \"It is simply unconscionable that, after losing 173 Chicagoans to speed-related traffic fatalities in 2021, some aldermen are acting with so little regard for public safety. By state law, the revenues generated by these fines help pay for public safety, infrastructure, after-school programming in parks and schools, Safe Passage workers, and many more vital programs.\"WTTW reports that South Side Ald. Anthony Beale (9th) said the Lightfoot administration has generated between $40 million and $45 million from the speed cameras.Taylor, after the council meeting, echoed King and Hairston, saying people of color are bearing the cameras' price.\"We are taxing poor people again. If we hate poor people, just say we hate poor people,\" Taylor said. \"There are other ways to make money. Tax the rich.\"She said studies should be done on every speed camera in Chicago to gauge their effect on public safety.There are two cameras locally, both near Washington Park: at 536 E. Morgan Drive and 5330 S. Cottage Grove Ave.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Go get \u2018em!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0That was Sandra Bivens\u2019 rallying cry at the 13th annual Woodlawn Community Summit, a free networking event for business owners, city officials and residents to discuss housing, public safety and economic development in the community.\u00a0The summit, co-hosted and sponsored by the South East Chicago Commission, took place Saturday morning at the University of Chicago Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice, 969 E. 60 St.Bivens, a Woodlawn resident and the executive director of the\u00a0Washington Park-Grand Boulevard based\u00a051st Street Business Association, kicked off the event with a mid-morning panel discussion centered on two topics: The City\u2019s development plans for the neighborhood, and available grants for businesses and homeowners to renovate their properties and develop new neighborhood amenities.These developments and grants come as the City prepares for the opening of the long-controversial Obama Presidential Center (OPC), now under construction at Woodlawn\u2019s east end.\u00a0\u201cWe want Woodlawn to have all the services and amenities you would expect in a healthy neighborhood,\u201d\u00a0 said Department of Planning and Development Commissioner Maurice Cox, a panelist. \u201cCulture, recreation, health care, public transit, retailers, restaurants\u2026 We\u2019re excited to be able to ride the [OPC\u2019s] coattails.\u201dBefore an audience of more than 100 attendees, Cox detailed the City\u2019s plans for \u201creimagining Woodlawn.\u201d He described a\u00a0 \u201ccharm bracelet\u201d approach by city planners to draw tourists from the OPC westward, deeper into the Woodlawn community.\u00a0It\u2019s at Cottage Grove Avenue where the City is hanging its first charms, according to Cox. A zone about 15 minutes\u2019 walk from the OPC\u2019s Jackson Park campus is already under development, anchored by the CTA\u2019s Cottage Grove Green Line station at 63rd Street. The area surrounding the station is a Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district where more than $150 million is being invested in new construction.\u00a0That includes an overhaul of the CTA station; construction of the new 45,000-square-foot Friend Health headquarters and clinic; and a retail and residential complex called Woodlawn Park Station, to be built by private developer DL3. The first phase of Friend Health construction is nearly complete and the facility will open next month, Cox said. A second building is planned, along with a parking structure.\u00a0The Chicago Public Library\u2019s Bessie Coleman branch will move to the locale, and the Washington Bank building will be renovated for offices, retail stores and a food court.\u00a0Closer to the OPC, the City owns a two-block stretch of 63rd Street adjoining the Hyde Park Day School, 6254 S. Ellis Ave, and the University of Chicago\u2019s charter school at 6300 S. University Ave. Cox said the City plans to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for six new mixed-use buildings to be developed there, over the next seven to 10 years.\u00a0Vacant city-owned lots from 63rd to 65th Street will also be named in RFPs for the construction of new homes. \u201cWe want to fill in the missing teeth along those streets,\u201d Cox said. The City would dedicate clusters of residential parcels to specified types of housing: single-family homes, townhomes, or two- or three-flats.\u00a0Cox added that 30 percent of the residential units throughout these new developments would be affordable, meeting the requirements of the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which was created to help combat OPC-driven displacement of residents. The ordinance, passed as a compromise to a long-fought for community benefits agreement, mandates that, \u201con 25% of city-owned vacant land, 30% of units in each project must be affordable at 30-50% of Area Median Income.\u201dHe said the City will not designate individual parcels for affordable housing until larger plans for the surrounding area have solidified: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this piecemeal.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Cox was asked about a sprawling development envisioned by J. Byron Brazier and his father, Pastor Byron Brazier of the Apostolic Church of God, 6320 S. Dorchester Ave. The megachurch has acquired much adjacent property, and in December of 2021, the pair presented a model of Woodlawn Central, an eight-acre \u201ccultural complex\u201d they want to develop at a cost of $600 million. Among its amenities would be a hotel, retail and office space, performance venues and up to 870 units of mixed-income housing.\u00a0Responding to the question, Cox said, \u201cThe market will do what the market will do. We can\u2019t control it\u2026But I would not lose a lot of sleep over this. I\u2019ve seen dozens of projects like this and, literally, in my two years as commissioner I have not seen a single one advance. It\u2019s one thing to hire an architect to do a vision. It\u2019s another thing to get it financed by a bank and get it constructed.\u201dThough the OPC is controversial, the dollars under discussion, available through a variety of grants panelists detailed, were real. Some of them are linked to Woodlawn\u2019s two TIF\u00a0districts. Others, including federal pandemic-recovery grants, are available to Chicagoans citywide. There are grants for new business and cultural initiatives, and for renovating existing homes and businesses. Low- and middle-income Woodlawn residents threatened with displacement may qualify for help with rent, mortgage payments or property taxes.\u00a0Bivens acknowledged the application process for grants can be intimidating, especially for first-time applicants. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared of these grants,\u201d Bivens said. \u201cYou do have to have a game plan. And a lot of people are going after these funds, so you may not get that first grant, but try it! You may surprise yourself.\u201d\u00a0Said Bivens to the group, \u201cC\u2019mon, you\u2019ve been living in Chicago, you know how it works. You gotta know somebody.\u201d She nodded toward Cox as he pocketed the phone number of a young man looking for help with a nonprofit venture. \u201cNow you know somebody.\u201d\u00a0After the plenary session, an hour was devoted to breakout meetings on three topics: home ownership, sustainable development and public safety. The networking session for current or prospective homeowners was overseen by Associated Bank\u2019s Paula Grant, vice president for residential lending. The Chicago Police Department\u2019s 3rd District commander, Roderick Watson, led the public safety session focused on collaboration between police and community residents. The sustainability session was led by Naomi Davis, founder of Blacks in Green.\u00a0Members of Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP)\u00a0march outside the Crown Family School building, 969 E. 60th St. and attempt to disrupt Mayor\u00a0Lori Lightfoot as she speaks inside the building during the 13th Annual Woodlawn Community\u00a0Summit, Saturday, June 11.Midway through the summit, Mayor Lori Lightfoot arrived to give a brief address. Upon her arrival, members of the Woodlawn-based group Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP) marched the sidewalk outside the venue, shouting and carrying signs that read \u201cwe demand affordable housing here.\u201d Since shortly after her election, the group has feuded with the mayor over the Obama Center and the changes it will bring to their neighborhoods.

I'm skeptical because the City promised Woodlawn 52 lots, as part of this \"CBA\" compromise, but now Mr. Cox is saying \"we aren't doing this piecemeal\", leaving me wondering what will happen to this promise. There will be jobs available at this center, who will get them? An athletic center, 'community kitchens', the museum?Can we get a CBA for any of the opportunities available at the Obama Center?\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

  "text": "Members of the CBA Coalition rally at the intersection of Wrightwood and Kimball Avenues, down the street from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Logan Square home, Saturday, June 11.Members of the CBA Coalition rally at the intersection of Wrightwood and Kimball Avenues, down the street from Mayor Lori Lightfoot's Logan Square home, Saturday, June 11.As construction on the Obama Presidential Library progresses in Jackson Park, community organizations and tenants continue to push for anti-displacement protections for Woodlawn and South Shore residents.On Saturday, members of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Coalition brought their concerns about the lack of affordable and safe housing and the rising cost of living to Wrightwood and Kimball avenues, the intersection closest to Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s Logan Square home. Around 150 people gathered for the rally, forming a circle in the street\u2019s center and cheering, chanting and tending to young children.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve had to come together more to have our voices heard under Lori Lightfoot than Rahm Emanuel,\u201d said Porsche Patrice, an organizer with Southside Together Organizing for Power (STOP), a Woodlawn-based community organization and coalition member.The CBA coalition was formed in 2016, shortly after Jackson Park was selected as the site for the presidential center, to ensure surrounding residents would be able to have a say in and benefit from the influx of money and new development.\u00a0The City didn\u2019t concede on the agreement, and Barack and Michelle Obama declined to support the CBA or the coalition\u2019s efforts. But over the course of the next several years STOP, alongside KOCO, Not Me We, BYP100 and other groups, helped draft the 2020 Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, which required the city to set aside 52 vacant lots in Woodlawn for affordable housing, and dedicated $4.5 million toward expanding housing programs in the neighborhood, with a focus on low- and moderate-income families, among other provisions.At the Saturday rally, residents spoke in frustration about the City\u2019s slowness to move forward with delivering on the affordable housing development promised in that ordinance and about South Shore\u2019s near-total exclusion from City protections, during what one South Shore resident called the \u201cheight of crisis.\u201d South Shore and Hyde Park were cut out of the 2020 ordinance before its passage.South Shore, where more than three out of every four residents is a renter, has had the highest eviction rate in the city for 12 consecutive years. And although property rates and rental prices have skyrocketed, with single-family home prices nearly doubling in the last year alone, according to Redfin data, coalition members say that the neighborhood has not seen adequate protections extended from the city.\u00a0Among coalition demands are the allocation of city funds toward the preservation and rehabilitation of vacant single-family and multi-unit buildings to protect tenants and homeowners alike. They also list a \u201cRight to Return\u201d policy that prioritizes longterm South Shore residents who have already been or are about to be displaced from the neighborhood.\u201cThe first step is providing more affordable housing,\u201d said Woodlawn resident Marilyn Harper. She said that although she lives in a building owned by a family member, the rising property taxes put her and other family members at risk of rent increase. Other family members have sought out new rental units only to find units that they would struggle to afford even with jobs that pay above the minimum wage of $15 an hour, she added.\u201cWe are two blocks from Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s residence. Why is it that she lives in a beautiful neighborhood and lives in a nice home where she can see her children grow up, she can never worry about being displaced or facing eviction due to rising rent and property tax? We want the same agreement, to live in a community where the rent is affordable and still have money to enjoy the simple things in life.\u201d\u00a0Linda Jennings, a 64-year resident of South Shore, said that as a senior condo owner\u00a0 she feels particularly vulnerable to displacement. \u201cLiving in an elegant prewar structure built in 1928, we have rising infrastructure repair costs and other issues associated with an aging structure,\u201d Jennings said.\u201cThe building next to my condo had those costs. Those condo owners resided over 50 years in their condo. They believed when retirement approached they would have constant stability, living along the lake and that they would enjoy their golden years with a sense of security However it didn\u2019t occur. Rising costs of infrastructure repairs (and other issues) could not be covered by assessments.\u201cOwners fought hard to keep their homes but they lost. A property investor bought the building, paid owners below rate for their homes in an already red-lined neighborhood.\u201dRally speakers noted that neither Lightfoot nor Ald. Hairston (5th) were standing with residents at the rally (South Shore Ald. Taylor (20th) was also not present). Municipal elections will occur in 2023. Lightfoot recently launched a reelection campaign; Hairston has not commented yet on whether she will run for another term. Alds. Taylor (20th) and Hairston introduced the 2020 ordinance as a compromise to legislation introduced by the mayor.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe power structure is working with investors to take over our homes and that ain\u2019t right,\u201d said Jennings. \u201cThese people deserve to live in South Shore and I deserve to live in South Shore.\u201d\u201cYou have a city council and a mayor that is complicit in the changing of the demographic of South Shore. Your vote is not a giveaway.\u201dYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.\n                            \n    Log In\n                        Keep it Clean.

Kwame Raoul (D-13th) celebrates at Valois, 1518 E. 53rd St., after winning election to be Illinois attorney general, Nov. 7, 2018Keen political observers of candidates' ballot filings may have noticed something this primary season go-around: Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul's residence is no longer listed on Drexel Square.He maintained that home while his children were finishing college, and his youngest just graduated. And now, the University of Chicago Lab Schools graduate, two-time 4th Ward aldermanic candidate and former local state senator has moved with his wife to River North.\"Having lived in Hyde Park for the vast majority of my life, I'm in this weird state of no longer being a Hyde Parker, or no longer living or residing in Hyde Park,\" Raoul said in an interview. \"I think Hyde Park resides in me, having spent all my formative years in Hyde Park, attended school in Hyde Park, lived in Hyde Park when I went to college and law school and started working.\"\"It is strange for me,\" he said. He recently had his 40-year Lab School reunion and recalled that it was strange to walk around the neighborhood with old friends, most of whom had left Hyde Park long ago, when he had done it so relatively late in life.\"When I say something like 'Hyde Park is in me,' I'm not exaggerating that. There's just a character to the neighborhood that embraces diversity, enables one's capacity to communicate to different types of people in a way that many neighborhoods may not necessarily foster that just by way of your having lived there for so long,\" he said.\"You can walk down 53rd Street or down Hyde Park Boulevard or down 57th Street and interact with all different types of people. And that lends something to you, particularly for the career path that I've taken on.\"The area still remains a residence of a disproportionately high number of local politicians. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle has lived here since she matriculated at the U. of C. Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) live in Kenwood. State Sen. Robert Peters (D-13th) and Samir Mayekar, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's deputy mayor for economic and neighborhood development, live in Hyde Park, as does Deputy Gov. Christian Mitchell, a former state representative.And Raoul's state Senate predecessor, former President Barack Obama, still maintains his voting registration on Greenwood Avenue, though he has lived in Washington since 2009.Raoul may not build a center dedicated to his service as attorney general in the neighborhood after he leaves office \u2014 he is seeking reelection this year \u2014 but he said he will continue identifying with the neighborhood.\"It is me,\" he said. \"From preschool through most of my working career, I lived in Hyde Park.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Sophia King (4th) look on.Industrial Massillon, Ohio, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's hometown near Akron, was not an easy place to be gay in the 1960s and '70s, and even when she went to college at the University of Michigan, she didn't know many out people in Ann Arbor.She came out in Chicago, after she matriculated at the University of Chicago Law School in 1986.\"Ironically in the conservative U. of C. Law School, there were a lot of gay people,\" Lightfoot said in an interview with the Herald. \"I\u00a0 just really felt like, \u2018OK, this is who I am\u2019 . . . It was just feeling comfortable in my own skin and feeling who I was.\"In addition to that, Lightfoot's Hyde Park years were the first time in her life that she \"really felt Black,\" she said. Lightfoot did not say that this was because she was living in the overwhelmingly Black South Side, but \"because there were so many negative things about being Black in Hyde Park.\"She recalled southward-facing barbed-wire fences on 61st Street \u2014 \"That sent a really clear message: we don't want the surrounding neighborhood, which was overwhelmingly Black, to be a part of the university community.\"Each of her three years of law school included \"a pretty significant racial event\" that she said was either caused or exacerbated by the law school.Bigelow Fellows teach first-year U. of C. Law School students academic legal writing; in Lightfoot's class, nine out of 175 students were Black. A few of the Black students didn't do well on the fellows' first paper, and so one of the teachers suggested putting all of the Black students in a remedial writing course.\"There was a professor there who said around this whole issue that the law school had an obligation to make sure that we were just as good as the white students by the time that we'd graduate. Of course he was white: no Black or brown professor would say such an absurd thing,\" she said. \"The tonality of that really set the stage for really hard stuff.\"Lightfoot also described an incident with another Black student being interviewed by a recruiter from\u00a0 Baker & McKenzie, then one of the country\u2019s largest law firms, during their final year at the school. According to Lightfoot (and reported in the Tribune) the recruiter made a string of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic comments during the interview, such as using slurs and retorting to the student\u2019s interest in golf that there were \u201cnot many golf courses in the ghetto.\u201d Lightfoot, who was president of the Law Students Association, helped put pressure on the university to suspend the firm from campus for a year.Lightfoot said that Hyde Park today \"is a very, very different place now than what it was.\"\"There were very little amenities, very little restaurants, very few things for a young person, like myself, to really do,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole social life was on the North Side.\u201d Lightfoot added that she was \u201ctraumatized\u201d by her time in law school.\u00a0She lived in the neighborhood all three years, but she recalled that the school had buses that would take people to the North Side on the weekends. \"My knowledge and orientation of the city was outside of Hyde Park, not in Hyde Park,\" she said.An exception to that rule was Promontory Point.\"Promontory Point was such an oasis for me when I lived in Hyde Park,\" she said. \"When I first lived in Hyde Park, I lived at 55th and Everett, so right around the corner. So it was so easy for me to get to Promontory Point, and it was just this magical place where you're out there on the lake, people are swimming in the water, and you can see the rest of the city. I have such incredibly fond memories of Promontory Point.\"The thing that concerns me now is it's being washed away,\" she said. \"It's being eroded.\"\"We're at a point of reckoning, because the Point's being washed away, and we've got to come up with a resolution that I think works for the community, works for preservationists, but also works for the environment and the Army Corps of Engineers, and fix it in a way that we're not going to have to come back five years or 10 years from now,\" Lightfoot said.Would that long-term fix preserve the steps' beloved exposed limestone, or would they be replaced by concrete, as is in place on much of the rest of the lakefront?\"Of course I love the way it looks now, but I don't know if that's a realistic way to preserve the Point without it literally washing away,\" Lightfoot said.That may be a tough pill for some people to swallow.\"There's a reason it hasn't been fixed yet,\" Lightfoot said. \"I absolutely love Promontory Point.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comMayor Lori Lightfoot announced her bid for reelection on June 7, asking voters for more time to run a city racked by crisis after crisis and touting herself as a fighter who has met those moments who can meet the ones to come.\u201cI don\u2019t look or sound like any other mayor we\u2019ve ever had before, and I\u2019ve had to fight to get a seat at the table. And, like so many in our city, I\u2019ve had to fight to have my voice heard,\u201d Lightfoot said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never back down from fighting every day to turn your voice into action.\u201d\u201cWhen we got knocked down by COVID, we came together as a City and we got right back up. Because that\u2019s who we are \u2013 and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to make so much progress, despite all that\u2019s been thrown at us.\u201cOf course there are tough challenges ahead. We have a lot of work to do, because change just doesn\u2019t happen overnight. But together, we will make our city safer, fairer, and more equitable for all. Now, let\u2019s get back to work.\u201dShe campaigned the next day in Greater Grand Crossing, touting her Invest South/West initiative that seeks to spur investment on South and West Side neighborhoods through a combination of private and public funds. The program has targeted corridors in Bronzeville and South Shore; along South Cottage Grove Avenue, it has been tied to the development of the 4400 Grove complex and Northwestern Medicine's planned $100 million outpatient care center.Next February's election has attracted an unusually high number of declared and potential candidates for an election with an incumbent Chicago mayor, including local state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th).\u201cMayor Lightfoot has proven to be utterly ill-equipped to lead Chicago,\" he said in a statement. \"Carjackings and violence are at record highs, economic disinvestment is drying up our neighborhoods, our schools are under-resourced, our police department is over-extended and under-staffed. Instead of a public safety plan, she\u2019s raised bridges, put up barricades and demanded curfews.\"\u201cWhen Chicago votes for a new Mayor, they\u2019re picking a new direction for our city. I\u2019m a skilled negotiator who\u2019s brought people together to get things done and passed groundbreaking, comprehensive laws around clean energy, banning ghost guns, and public safety and justice.\"ReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

Nerves were fried after the promise of vaccines ending the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 evaporated with breakthrough infections and then a massive wave of illness and death due to the omicron variant.Suffice it to say that things got better. 2022 turned out to be the most \u201cnormal\u201d year on an everyday basis than any since 2019. Several weeks\u2019 disruption at the beginning of the year yielded month after month of cultural events, business openings and closings, breakups and births, school days and workweeks.Nonetheless, we live differently now. The pandemic continues to affect life; President Joe Biden declared it \u201cover\u201d in September, though his administration extended the public health emergency into next year. Many people keep working from home years after the practice began across the economy to prevent an even worse epidemiological catastrophe. Societal groups like the elderly and immunocompromised remain vigilant and disproportionately affected by COVID-19; the youngest in society, who have lived most or all of their lives amidst the public health emergency, are getting stung by respiratory viruses spreading wildly in a largely unmasked world.More than one publication has noted that pandemics end when people, exhausted by panic and with the protection of vaccinations or exposure to the disease, decide they do. Society appears to have crossed that threshold in 2022, profoundly changed and, for better or worse, in many ways still fundamentally the same.Hyde Park's 5th Ward voters cast their primary ballots on Tuesday, June 28, at the\u00a01700 E. 56 St. polling place.\u00a0The great local cycle of elections began again this year with the primary elections for state and congressional offices followed by the November midterms. Next year will see two rounds of municipal elections and then, nationally, the presidential primary campaign beginning in earnest and, before we know it, the elections of 2024.Most people do not live their lives minutely attuned to politics and government \u2014 indeed, just over 53% of Hyde Park-Kenwood voters cast midterm election ballots \u2014 but this journalist does.\u00a0For some of us, 2022 may be remembered for the longtime elected officials who announced their retirements \u2014 U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-1st) after 30 years in Washington, D.C., Ald. Leslie Hairston (5th) after serving in City Council since 1999, Ald. Sophia King (4th) to run for mayor \u2014 and for the nationwide scrambling of American politics by the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in June.\u00a0\"The worst of it will be for people who have the least control,\" said Martha Scott, a former member of the Hyde Park-based Jane collective, a group that illicitly performed abortions in the late 1960s and early '70s.\u00a0\"Many, many important decisions for our lives are made by people who have no concern for what our lives might be like,\" she said. \"I don't have a heavy political orientation here. I just want things to be different. But it's not going to happen for a while.\"Illinois became a bulwark for the procedure as neighboring states banned or severely restricted abortions. Though local primary election turnout was low in the immediate aftermath of the court\u2019s decision, general election turnout was higher than normal in many states. In the end, expectations of a national \u201cred wave\u201d for the GOP were not realized, though the Republicans did gain nine seats in the House of Representatives, enough to seize control of it from the Democrats.County Commissioner Bill Lowry (D-3rd) \u2014 who was proud to announce the resumption of ambulance services at Provident Hospital in October \u2014 won unopposed in both the primary and general elections. So did state Reps. Lamont Robinson (D-5th) and Kam Buckner (D-26th) and state Sens. Mattie Hunter (D-3rd) and Robert Peters (D-13th).\u00a0\u00a0Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle easily won reelection to another four-year term. State Rep. Curtis J. Tarver II (D-25th) and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-2nd) also both won reelections to another term.Rush, who is perhaps best known for his late 1960s membership in the Illinois Black Panther Party and for, in 2000, beating former President Barack Obama in a congressional primary election, announced his retirement early in January.\u00a0\"For me, I have a higher calling, and I am entering that higher calling,\u201d he said at his announcement, referring to his work as pastor of a Bronzeville church. \u201cI will remain in public life, in public service, fighting for equity and justice for and within my community\u2026 accompanied by the learned tools that I have gained in a whole lifetime of public service.\"His decision touched off a cattle call of a 15-candidate campaign. Candidates included Ald. Pat Dowell (3rd), Hyde Parker Jonathan Swain, owner of Kimbark Beverage Shoppe and State Sen. Jacqui Collins (D-16th).\u00a0In the end it was Jonathan Jackson, son of civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would take the crown.\u00a0\u00a0\"People are proud to be Kennedys, and they should be. People are proud to be Daleys, and they should be... But Chicago, you have made me proud to be a Jackson,\" he said on the night of Nov. 8. \u201cAll we do is win, win win.\u201dJackson ran a campaign seeking appointment to the House Financial Services Committee and oriented around \u201cgas, guns and groceries,\u201d or inflation and local endemic\u00a0 firearm violence. Questions and concerns exist about vast financial support for his campaign from a political action committee funded by now-indicted and disgraced cryptocurrency tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried, whose company, FTX, stands accused of embezzlement.\u00a0A state referendum enshrining a fundamental right to to form unions and engage in collective bargaining in the Illinois Constitution passed, as did a county referendum to increase property taxes to pay for upgrades to the Forest Preserves.\u00a0\u00a0As construction continued on the Obama Presidential Center \u2014 a federal district court shot down another attempt to block its establishment in November \u2014\u00a0 10 precincts in three wards passed advisory referendums in the primary and general elections calling on the city and park district to \u201cstop cutting down trees in Jackson Park and preserve the trees in South Shore Cultural Center Park.\u201dHairston joined the 14 other alderpersons leaving the City Council when she announced her retirement in late August.\"I'm proudest of the ways in which I have transformed the communities that I represent, the open lines of communications, the economic development that I've been able to achieve \u2014 there's a lot,\" she said. \"I came in here to work in my community and to build my community.\"\u00a0As of Dec. 22, almost 20 candidates are running for alderman of the 4th and 5th wards. Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th), whose ward was redrawn to include a northwestern Hyde Park precinct, is seeking reelection against two challengers.\u00a0Also this summer, Ald. Sophia King (4th) and state Rep. Buckner\u00a0announced mayoral runs.\u00a0\u00a0In all, 10 candidates are running against Lightfoot, including activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, a Hyde Parker. Neither he, King nor Buckner are currently considered frontrunners in the election, but neither was Lightfoot at the close of 2018.Legislatively, the Anjanette Young Ordinance, which would have codified police search and raid rule changes, failed to pass out of committee in November; the council\u2019s Black progressive alderwomen, including King, Hairston and Taylor, had introduced it in 2021.\u00a0The General Assembly did not pass a great deal of major legislation in an election year beyond a $46 billion budget and a bill targeting \"smash-and-grab\" retail thefts by attempting to target ringleaders of organized retail crime rings with greater penalties.\u00a0Buckner's initiative to ban \"ghost guns\" \u2014 firearms without serial numbers, often put together from mail-order kits \u2014 got the governor\u2019s signature, as did Hunter's efforts to create a Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women and to ban hair discrimination in the workplace.\u00a0Peters worked to increase investments for domestic violence organizations in the budget and spent the fall veto session engaged in negotiations around the SAFE-T Act, which was set to end cash bail in Illinois on Jan. 1 but has been stayed by the state Supreme Court.\u00a0In Congress, among other big legislation Rush and Kelly voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has $440 billion in new spending to fight climate change over the next decade through consumer rebates, tax credits and block grants as well as money for Obamacare subsidies.\u00a0\u00a0Rush\u2019s long-sought Emmett Till Antilynching Act passed in March, finally making lynching a federal crime. Kelly got federal funding to study how to preserve Promontory Point, which activists are trying to get named a city landmark. Lightfoot announced her support for preserving its limestone over the summer.Construction of the Obama Presidential Center is well under way, with the skeleton of its main tower now visible above the fence that encloses its 19 acre campus in Jackson Park.It was a year of openings and of closings of some longtime Hyde Park businesses.The openings kicked off the year. In January, Hyde Parker Steve Soble opened Roux, 1055 E. 55th St., a Southern restaurant with an emphasis on breakfast, while modernizing (and removing the pool tables from)\u00a0 the Seven Ten Social bowling alley next door.\u00a0The Silver Room owner Eric Williams and Cecilia Cuff opened their long-expected Bronzeville Winery, 4220 S. Cottage Grove., in April, part of the mixed-use 4400 Grove development that opened two years ago. Also in April, Mexican-influenced Almendro Caf\u00e9 replaced Bridgeport Coffee at the Hyde Park Art Center, 5020 S. Cornell Ave.Huaraches Mexican Restaurant, 1611 E. 55th St., Cajun Boil and Shake, 5500 S. Shore Drive and British-style gastropub Truth Be Told, 1227 E. 60th St., all opened in May.Erick Williams, owner and head chef of four-year-old Virtue, 1462 E. 53rd St., won a James Beard Award for best chef of the Great Lakes region in June. Daisy\u2019s, his restaurant and bar specializing in New Orleans po-boys, opened in August, along with the local burger chain Small Cheval Overlooking the outdoor dining area in Nichols Park is a new mural of troubled, beloved soul legend Donny Hathaway, a former Hyde Parker.Closing out the year, Chicago Birthworks Collective, a company specializing in doula services for Black parents, opened in November at 1603 E. 55th St., as did Recycled Modern, a vintage and modern home decor store and art gallery at 5231 S. Harper Court.The closings began with Mellow Yellow, a diner of 46 years at 1508 E. 53rd St., in May. The Great Frame Up, a custom picture frame shop and local art seller since 1976, 1418 E. 53rd St., closed in August. Opened in 1983, Piccolo Mondo cafe and restaurant closed at the end of November at 1642 E. 56th St. And La Petite Folie, open since 1999 at 1504 E. 55th St., closed at the end of December.Even as pandemic-related supply chain issues ebbed this year \u2014 though parents experienced the crisis of a nationwide baby formula shortage in the spring, which still somewhat continues \u2014 inflation nipped hard at area retailers, restaurants and consumers.Motorists dealt with spiking gasolene prices after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Local independent retailers, which lack their own distribution centers or warehouses to store vast quantities of goods purchased directly from suppliers instead of wholesalers, were particularly affected.\"When we get a new order, we look at the invoice and see everything is going up 30%, some 40%,\" said Wael Ghousheh of Valley of Jordan Food, 1009 E. 53rd St., in January. \"When you go up 10%, it's OK. But when you go 40%, 50%, the customer feels it.\"Inflation was slowing month-over-month by the end of the year after a 9.1% peak in June, though food prices remain high. Financial markets slumped and borrowing got more expensive as the Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in 2022.\u00a0Outside of retail and restaurants, local developments also occurred in health care and housing. Phil Moy was named to head the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce, 1525 E. 53rd St. in July.Plans finalized for the now-$130 million Northwestern Medicine 120,000-square-foot outpatient center at 4800 S. Cottage Grove Ave., which was announced in 2021. Construction is set to begin next year, with a projected 2025 opening.UChicago Medicine, meanwhile, announced plans in February to build a $663 million, 500,000-square-foot, 128-bed clinical cancer center in\u00a0 Hyde Park, which is expected to open in 2026. And in July, Friend Health, a federally qualified health center, opened a new $43 million headquarters and flagship medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care at 6250 S. Cottage Grove Ave.\u00a0In November, work began on the mixed-income Park Station Lofts, the first property to be built under the Woodlawn Housing Preservation Ordinance, with set-asides for low-income renters. And this month, Pangea Properties, the now-large company that began in Chicago in 2009 and owns some local residential buildings in Kenwood, Washington Park and South Shore, sold its entire Chicago portfolio for $600 million to New York-based Emerald Empire.In organized labor, workers at Howard Brown Health, which has a clinic at 1525 E. 55th St., and the Starbucks at 1174 E. 55th St. unionized \u2014 the latter the first on the South Side among a nationwide organizing wave of the chain coffee shops. In September, the Graduate Students United union at the U. of C. voted to affiliate with the United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America after being independent for years.And several changes happened at the Hyde Park Herald. Hannah Faris replaced Christian Belanger as editor in May, and in July, Bruce Sagan, the previous owner of the 140-year-old news organization, transferred the masthead to a nonprofit that now runs both it and the South Side Weekly.Sagan said becoming a nonprofit was a bid for survival and sustainability for the third oldest news organization in Chicago. \"For me, the community newspaper has always been one of the things that has made a community,\" he added.\"I'm doing this now because I believe this is an opportunity for the business model to be developed in a way that could be very meaningful to the whole situation,\" he continued. \"It gives me great satisfaction to know that we may, if we're very lucky, develop some ideas that prove the model for the future. Everybody's looking for it. Everybody's trying.\"Bright Star Church Pastor Chris Harris gets a bivalent COVID-19 booster before Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady gets an influenza vaccine, waiting for the booster herself because of her August coronavirus infection, after a Friday press conference at the department's headquarters, 333 S. State St.New Year's Day almost coincided with the highest-ever number of COVID-19 emergency room visits in Chicago. Average daily hospitalizations peaked on Jan. 5, and average daily deaths peaked at 31 on Jan. 12 \u2014 the highest since the first peak of COVID-19 deaths in early May 2020.Those deaths did not occur evenly throughout the city. A Herald analysis of city data found that the mid-South Side took a disproportionate brunt of the surge last winter, largely because of low vaccination rates among Black South Siders.\u201cBecause of individual and systemic racism, there's not a lot of trust in government at baseline. There's not a lot of trust in the medical system,\u201d said Chicago public health commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady in an early spring interview.\u00a0Because of its contagiousness, omicron also infected many people who had already been vaccinated. While omicron was less virulent than other coronavirus variants, the sheer number of people who got it meant that a large segment of the population, especially unvaccinated, elderly and immunocompromised people, got seriously sick. Many died.The state\u2019s mask mandate ended at the end of February. While emergency room visits and hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients have risen and fallen \u2014 though at year's end more than 5% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, a concerning statistic \u2014 deaths have stayed low across Chicago.In the summer, Dr. Emily Landon, UChicago Medicine's chief epidemiologist, noted that health care providers have gotten increasingly good at treating COVID-19. But with people contracting the disease again and again, people are taking chances of developing long COVID or having severe acute outcomes.\"We're just going to see a certain number of individuals have their lives cut short by COVID, because they just can't take it again,\" she said. \"What we do not have is a way to significantly prevent long-term consequences in people \u2014 we don't even know how bad or not bad the long-term consequences are, just that all the signals suggest there are pretty bad long-term consequences \u2014 and we also don't have a way to prevent people from getting sick.\"COVID-19 vaccines became available for children 6 months to 5 years old in June; uptake has been incredibly slow. Booster uptake has also been incredibly slow.Meanwhile, young children have been hit incredibly hard by what Comer Children\u2019s Hospital in October called an \u201c\u200b\u200bearly and aggressive respiratory virus season.\u201d Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which most children typically get before they turn 2, caused serious infections in many children this year, even in older children.The other health news of the year concerned a disease with person-to-person spread hitherto unknown outside of Africa: monkeypox. The infection, which causes an initial fever, aches and swollen lymph nodes followed by the eruption of extremely painful blisters that take weeks to heal, spread worldwide this summer through sex among men who have sex with men.\u00a0The outbreak, much like COVID-19\u2019s two years before, caught the federal government flat-footed, with nowhere near enough supply of vaccine to protect at-risk people. Supply eventually increased through importation and the administration of smaller doses, but more than 1,100 Chicagoans tested positive for it by the end of the year, including dozens who tested positive for it in Hyde Park clinics.As his brother Umi watches, Malachi Clark, a University of Chicago Charter School student who \"maybe wants to have a YouTube channel that teaches kids about science,\" when he grows up, learns about angular momentum from a U. of C. graduate student during the South Side Science Festival, Saturday, September 17.Chicago Public Schools began the year in disarray, as the Chicago Teachers Union and district administration came to a standoff about reopening during the then-continuing omicron surge, with the union demanding a return to remote learning and the CPS canceling classes in response.\u00a0Schools eventually reopened after five canceled days on Jan. 12, after the two sides reached a deal. COVID-19 cases in the school system had dropped dramatically by the next month, after CPS halved the quarantine rule for positive cases to five days. Masks became optional in the middle of March.A wide disparity in COVID-19 vaccination rates emerged between predominantly Black schools and others; while Hyde Park-Kenwood bucked the trend compared to other South Side neighborhoods, local rates were still below the district average. District-wide rates declined in the fall, when new students enrolled in the system.Certain things slowly returned to more normal circumstances over the year. Prom happened after two years of cancellations and graduations were held indoors again.CPS-wide attendance levels declined, with the largest declines happening in majority-Black schools. Many local schools also saw their enrollments drop, which caused some of them \u2014 Hyde Park High, Shoesmith, Ray and Carnegie \u2014 to see decreased budgets, though the CPS-wide budget increased. More than a decade of district-wide enrollment declines also led to CPS dropping to the fourth-largest district in the nation.\u00a0Local school council elections in April failed to result in more than 1,400 positions getting filled, including 21 at every Hyde Park-Kenwood public school except Kenwood Academy when the new academic year began.Tragedy struck Kenwood on Sept. 9, when a new student from Hyde Park High, 17-year-old Kanye Perkins, was shot and killed in East Hyde Park during Kenwood's open-campus lunch hour.\u00a0\"It is a very devastating event for our school community, and I went through very many steps to ensure that the 2,352 students who we have were safe,\" Principal Karen Calloway said at an LSC meeting shortly afterwards. School clinicians met with students to begin working through their trauma, and teachers discussed the event with their classes.\u00a0In high school sports, four Kenwood students \u2014 kick returner Davonte Johnson, defensive lineman Marquise Lightfoot, linebacker K\u2019Vion Thunderbird and defensive back Kahlil Taye \u2014 as well as Hyde Park High defensive lineman Aaron Mathews were named to the Sun-Times' All-Public League football team. Kenwood point guard Dai Dai Ames signed to play college basketball for the Kansas State Wildcats. The Kenwood girls flag football team placed second to Taft in the Public League's first city championship game, and the school\u2019s girls basketball team was the city runner-up to Whitney YoungThree new school heads took positions over the year: Michael Richie at Reavis Elementary, Liz Iverson at the Ancona School and Ken Koll at St. Thomas the Apostle School. Principal Greg Mason at Murray Language Academy has announced that after 15 years, this year will be his last before retiring next spring.\u00a0After a debate about co-education in light of a 20-year trend of declining enrollments, Mount Carmel High School decided in August to remain all-boys. (Its football team, meanwhile, won the Class 7A state championship this fall after a perfect season.)In higher education, the the University of Chicago and the French National Center for Scientific Research announced plans earlier this month to establish the two-campus (in Hyde Park and Paris) International Research Center for Fundamental Scientific Discovery, which will study large-scale interdisciplinary projects in energy, communication technologies, climate, mobility, health and social sciences.The school's investments in quantum engineering bore fruit with the first class of the Duality, Polsky Center startup accelerator graduating and the Chicago Quantum Exchange's quantum network becoming the biggest in the country.Economist Douglas W. Diamond won a shared Nobel Prize for research on bank runs and liquidity crises, and Jonathan Miller, a sociologist who studies mass incarceration, won a MacArthur \"genius grant.\" (Another awardee was South Side artist and architect Amanda Williams, a Lab School graduate known for her work around the intersection of race, policy and the built environment.)In sports, coach Julianne Sitch made history as the first woman to lead a men's soccer team to a national championship after an undefeated season for the Maroons. The school\u2019s men\u2019s tennis team also won the national championship for their division.Chosen Few DJ Mike Dunn performs during the\u00a0Chosen Few Festival and Picnic, Saturday, July 2, 2022.After a year of cancellations and another of half-starts, the annual festivals beloved by generations of Hyde Parkers returned in 2022.\u00a0Reflecting pent-up demand, the 61st annual Hyde Park Garden Fair nearly sold out its entire inventory on its first day, May 13.\"It was just great to be back,\" said head organizer Yolanda Bradley at the time. \"All of our customers said it as they came through, and we were saying the same thing: 'It's great to be back.'\"The 57th Street Art Fair celebrated its 75th anniversary in June, its first year back since 2019. So did the much younger Silver Room-sponsored Summer Fest, and 30,000 house heads attended the Chosen Few Festival and Picnic in Jackson Park in July, in a year that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s house track \"Break My Soul\"\u00a0 unequivocally became a song of the summer.\u201cI view those developments positively,\" Chosen Few DJ Alan King said at the time. \"Anything that can help extend (house) music to a younger audience or a different audience is a good thing.\"Institutionally, the Court Theatre won the 2022 Regional Theatre Tony Award in June, becoming the sixth Chicago theater, and the first in 11 years, to receive this honor. In August, it hired its first associate artistic director since 1993, Gabrielle Randle-Bent. The Smart Museum hired Vanja V. Malloy to be its director starting Oct. 1 after three years without a permanent head. And the Hyde Park Art Center elevated Jeannette Tremblay Chambers and Aaron Rodgers to be co-executive directors in December.Amid the myriad exhibitions that ran at local museums and galleries through the year, \u201cPaul B. Moses: Trailblazing Art Historian,\u201d on through the fall at the Regenstein Library, may have been the most poignant. Moses' son, Hyde Parker Michael Moses, curated it as a means to pay tribute to his father, who was murdered in a carjacking when Michael Moses was 3.The father was a talented painter influenced by the Impressionists and his studies in France and, as a Black man in the mid-20th century, a trailblazing academic.\u201cThe exhibit gave me the opportunity to basically find out who he was, who he is, who he may have been,\u201d said Moses, a longtime Lab School gym teacher.\u00a0A crowd of more than 100 friends and family gather outside Reavis Elementary, 5001 S. Cottage Grove Ave., for Hannah Hayes' memorial, Saturday, August 6.Several local figures of note died in 2022, many before their time.Among them was Diego Damis, a beloved bartender at The Cove Lounge, 1750 E. 55th St., and an Italian immigrant, was murdered while walking home from work on Feb. 25. A South Shore 18-year-old was arrested shortly thereafter.Gerald Cook, a coworker and friend, said Damis embodied the spirit of Hyde Park through his inclusivity and openness.\u00a0\"He was one of those personalities who made Hyde Park what it is,\u201d Cook said. \u201cHe had a different world perspective, obviously, coming from a different country, but he definitely embraced Hyde Park and Chicago.\u201dOn July 11, a hit-and-run driver killed Hannah Hayes, a journalist, educator and progressive activist who helped found Friends of Ray and who served on the Reavis LSC.\"When I think about Hannah as an educator, I think of her selflessness,\" said colleague Margaret Murphy. \"It was very evident when I walked into (her) classroom that her students had developed two things, a sense of community among themselves and the self advocacy skills necessary to be a good student. It wasn't ever about her. It was always about her students.\"And on Oct. 4, Sergio Mims, the celebrated film critic, historian, writer and classical music DJ, died at 67.\"He loved filmmakers who were Chicago-based or who moved to LA to become filmmakers. They'd call Sergio when they wanted to have a screening or have their film reviewed. He would sit with Siskel and Ebert up there at the State and Lake screening room all the time, and he would really, really push all types of films,\" screenwriter Dwayne Johnson-Cochran said.Mims is best-known for founding the Black Harvest Film Festival.\u201cSerg felt that Black cinema was coming on and that it was ultimately going to be great,\" said friend Keith Boseman. \"They were telling stories that had not been told. He was very happy bout that. They were telling stories that had not been told, and he felt that the future was very bright.\"a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

The seat is now vacant for the first time in 24 years and already has two contenders: journalist and community organizer Gabriel Piemonte, and former Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce head Wallace Goode.

Pat Dowell (3rd) has committed to running for a fifth term, and Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) has yet to announce a decision.

  "title": "Ald. Sophia King running for mayor, talks city council tenure and public safety",
  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)ReporterAld. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th) says she would bring a different approach to leading Chicago than Mayor Lori Lightfoot has led, rebuking the city\u2019s executive for her relationship with alderpersons and council that she said is holding the city back.As chair of the City Council Progressive Reform Caucus, King said she has pushed the mayor for many of the left-of-center policy proposals that have been enacted during her administration.\u00a0\"When you talk about leadership, people want someone who can bring people together. I think I've shown that in many ways,\" King said in an interview. \"I led the 'Fight for $15.' We sat down with labor, with businesses, with community folks, with people who work in the industry and collaborated on getting to a $15 minimum wage.\"\"The Bronzeville Lakefront Development, the former Michigan Reese development, is being heralded as one of the most equitable developments in the country. But that didn't come without tension. There was tension in the community about what that was going to be. I sat down and created the Michael Reese Advisory Council, which got pushback early on but then became the model of how we do development in the city. That collaboration brought real benefits to the community.\"The multi-billion-dollar development is being marketed as \"a new mixed-use health innovation district\" across more than 100 acres, with residential and commercial opportunities as well as green and community spaces. GRIT Chicago LLC, the project's consortium of developers, has pledged $25 million for educational facilities near the site as well as internships, local contracting and hirings in Bronzeville.\"We sat down, listened and had tough discussions, and we came out with an equitable development, where the developer will see upsides but the community will, too,\" King said. \"That's not what we've been used to. And when you talk about the other striking developments, whether it's the 78, Lincoln Yards or even the Obama Foundation \u2014 they all had some form of protest.\"If elected, King promised tough discussions on the front end: \"Hard decisions that will have to be made, but they will be very informed decisions because of those discussions.\"A 2021 study from the University of Illinois Chicago Department of Political Science found, however, that King supported Lightfoot's position in her council votes 94% of the time. She has voted for all of Lightfoot's budgets, saying in 2019 that she believed Lightfoot was \"cautiously leading us in the right direction.\" But she said that year that there had been left \"progressive and structural revenue on the table.\"\u00a0Two years later, King, as chair of the progressive caucus, said there were wins in the budget to be voted on, even though \"we didn't get everything that we wanted.\"\"Just because you vote with somebody, I mean, good votes come down to (trying) to build consensus in this city,\" King said in the interview. \"You're trying to do what's right in the city.\"She pointed to the recent vote around speed cameras: Lightfoot had decreased the threshold for which motorists get fined for speeding, so that people going 6 to 9 mph over the speed limit get $35 fines. The cameras are posted near Chicago parks and public schools. A bid by some alderpersons, including King, Leslie Hairston (5th) and Jeanette Taylor (20th), to repeal that lowered threshold failed last month.\"There was this false choice between safety and equity,\" King said. \"The reason that I voted against that was because we were given this false choice. We already knew that these cameras were predominantly in Black and brown communities and it disproportionately impacted us.\"Lightfoot initiated the lowered threshold in March 2021.\"By executive order \u2014 not asking anybody, not talking to anybody,\" King said. \"What happens now is that we've doubled-down on those folks who are already struggling. Really, there's no equitable distribution. We could have distributed those cameras more equitably.The alderpersons' move to end the lowered threshold spurred pushback from bicyclists and other \"folks who are concerned about safety,\" King said, \"as if we're not concerned about safety. It's just a false narrative.\"\u00a0A WBEZ analysis of the lowered threshold found that there was around a 400% year-to-year increase in tickets issued after it went into effect and that the fines generated $105.9 million.\"We spent a lot of time and energy fighting a false fight,\" said King. \"As a leader, I would have said, 'Listen, let's redistribute the cameras in places where we'd perhaps make even more money, but it'll be a more equitable distribution.\"King said the status of policy making between the mayor's administration and the council is the key driver in alderpersons not running for reelection. This year, nine had either announced pending retirements or quit before King announced her mayoral candidacy.\u00a0\"We took away energy from other things that we could have been doing fighting over little stuff to get to that point,\" King said of the aldermanic work environment. \"That leadership can't be sustained. You are losing good people and institutional knowledge.\"King said she would recognize alderpersons' \"equal authority over the city.\"\"I understand my fellow city councilmen. I understand how hard they work and the role that they play in the community,\" she said. \"And by the way, we share the same constituents. If they're doing a good job in their communities, then that is reflected on the entire city. We are duly elected to represent our city, and we understand our communities better than anybody.\"\u00a0Other alderpersons \u2014 including ones who supported her in the 2019 mayoral election \u2014 have publicly broken with Lightfoot this year. Neither of the other two local alderwomen, Hairston and Taylor, backed Lightfoot three years ago, but both have made their unhappiness with her leadership known in City Hall and outside of it.King said she is not someone who seeks out tension. \"I'm not a combative person,\" she said. \"But I have had some heated discussions with the mayor. They've been outside of the media, where I think those discussions should happen.\"She said an ability to build relationships with the mayor is missing, which she said is leaving the city in crisis.Above all else, King has made public safety the cornerstone of her announcement\u2014 a common tactic among mayoral hopefuls this election cycle, such as local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26).\"We can have safety and justice,\" she reiterated. \"It takes a leader to articulate that. We can both support our police and hold them accountable. They shouldn't be mutually exclusive.\"King noted the 4th Ward's overlay of several communities down the South Side lakefront from downtown to Hyde Park; in every community, she said the top request she gets is for more police presence.She has long been critical of the 2011 restructuring of Chicago Police Department districts, which she says has led to fewer officers working in and around her ward. \"Our police are not distributed equitably, and there are not more police in the most violent neighborhoods,\" King said. She wants to change that.\u00a0She also noted that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are for nonviolent offenses, calling for more funds budgeted to social service professionals to deal with homelessness and mental health issues. Having those professionals to respond to emergencies will mean police do not have to.And King thinks there should be more targeted law enforcement against \"known folks in our communities who are wreaking havoc\" to \"put them on notice.\"She suggested there be opportunities like paid job training and trauma-informed care for a more compassionate criminal justice agenda. She said billions of dollars in federal money the city received through the 2021 American Rescue Plan remain to be put into place for that social policy agenda.\"We know if we do this well, it will be a limited problem. We will find our way out of this. We will have people getting jobs, they will start to earn money, they will start to buy homes, they will invigorate our economy.\"Lightfoot's administration has been marked by a revolving door of top-level staff; observers have noted her relative lack of managerial experience becoming the mayor of the third-largest city in the United States. Her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, was a congressman and White House chief of staff. Richard M. Daley was the Cook County state's attorney, in charge of hundreds of lawyers and prosecuting in the nation's second-largest county. Harold Washington was a congressman.\u00a0King does not have that kind of work experience, but she noted her administrative experience in Chicago Public Schools \u2014 she at one point ran the district's Sports Administration Department. She noted her position with the progressive caucus, working relationships with various municipal stakeholders, and that the 4th Ward contains, in addition to its varied communities, municipal assets like Grant Park, Northerly Island, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.\u00a0\"The key point is relationships. I think all those things put me in good stead to lead this city,\" she said.Conventional wisdom is that all the candidates of Chicago's 2023 mayoral election have yet to announce. King, for her part, says she will not back out of the race now that she\u2019s entered it. (That means the 4th Ward will have an open seat aldermanic election next year.)\"This is not a decision we made lightly, but it is a decision I will see through to the end,\" she said.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include\u00a0State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",

  "text": "Ald. Sophia King (4th)Ald. Sophia King (4th)Local Ald. Sophia King (4th) is officially running for mayor of Chicago.\u00a0The chair of the City Council's Progressive Reform Caucus, King is running against incumbent Lori Lightfoot and nine other candidates with a campaign focused on addressing violent crime in the city.In a campaign launch video released Wednesday morning, King said that violence is not an abstract problem to her.\"I've seen the pain it causes way too many times,\" she said. \"There's no question about it: we have to hold the people who commit violent crimes accountable. And we have to hold our leaders accountable, too.\"She said Chicagoans need a safer, stronger city, calling for safety and justice, compassion and accountability, neighborhood revitalization and downtown renewal and investments in education.\"We can build our city and build equity,\" King said, highlighting her long-standing focus towards Black hiring in fields like construction (as in the Michael Reese redevelopment, which also involved a significant community-engagement process to determine the site's new uses, and public-private partnerships like 4400 Grove) and local police districts.A release from her campaign notes that while goals for citywide nonwhite contractors aim for 25% of planned developments, the number exceeds 40% on projects King has worked on in the 4th Ward.\"Everything I've ever done has been achieved by bringing people together to find real solutions to problems confronting Chicago,\" she said. \"I'm running for mayor because we need more collaboration, not confrontation.\"King, 56, grew up in Evanston and has family in Mississippi. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master's degree in education and social policy from Northwestern University. She founded the Harriet's Daughter's nonprofit that works on employment opportunities in Black neighborhoods and co-founded Ariel Community Academy, 1119 E. 46th St.She was president of the Kenwood Park Advisory Council and vice president of Planned Parenthood of Chicago.Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to the seat in April 2016 when Ald. Will Burns resigned; she won a special election for the position early the next year and reelection by a 2-to-1 margin in 2019.Her husband is Alan King, a friend of former President Barack Obama and one of the Chosen Few DJs. They have two adult daughters and live in Kenwood.King's signature accomplishment on the City Council, the increase in the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour, would originally have covered tipped workers; their wages were decreased in a compromise to win Lightfoot's support. While King has voted for the mayor's budgets, she has noted the mayor's often-combative nature and dealings with alderpersons; council meetings have often devolved into screaming matches during Lightfoot's mayoralty.King's Anjanette Young Ordinance that would legally codify changes to the Chicago Police Department's search warrant and raids policy, co-sponsored by the other Black progressive alderwomen, has gone nowhere under Lightfoot's administration.\u00a0She is the third sitting alderperson to announce mayoral candidacy, joined by Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) and Ald. Roderick Sawyer (6th). Other challengers include local State Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26th), former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas, millionaire businessman Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green, Chicago police officer Frederick Collins and actor Bradley Laborman.An earlier version of this article misreported Ald.

Bobby Rush (D-1st), Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Reps. Danny Davis (D-7th) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd), June 30.Local U.S. Reps. Bobby Rush (D-1st) and Robin Kelly (D-2nd) endorsed Mayor Lori Lightfoot for reelection on June 30, praising her investments in South and West Side neighborhoods months ahead of the first-round vote in February.During Thursday\u2019s event at the DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center, 740 E 56th Pl., Kelly said she and the mayor have developed a friendship and partnership since Lightfoot took office.\"You stepped into a very, very tough period,\" Kelly told Lightfoot. \"And then there was COVID, and I think you did an excellent job dealing with COVID.\"She noted the mayor's Invest South/West initiative, which aims to revive commercial corridors in certain South and West Side neighborhoods through targeted public and private investments.\"There's still a lot of work to do, and I believe that you're the best person to be doing that work,\" Kelly said. \"You have to be tough to be the mayor of Chicago, and she doesn't lack that.\"Kelly, who is now the chair of the state Democratic Party, endorsed Lightfoot during her first run in 2019. Lightfoot, in turn, endorsed her for reelection to the state party chairmanship at the event.Though Rush endorsed Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle in the 2019 run-off, he has since changed his tune.\"I have seen her. I have talked with her. I have worked with her. I have walked with her. I have known her,\" said Rush, who is retiring from Congress after this term ends in January. \"I know she is indeed the best person to continue to be the mayor of the City of Chicago.\"He acknowledged Lightfoot\u2019s pugnaciousness \u2014 seen in frequent clashes with Chicago City Council \u2014 and the Invest South/West program.\"We all know Chicago has suffered from decades of disinvestment in the South and West sides,\" Rush said. \"Everybody knows it. Everybody accepts it, but nobody thought that they would stand up to change it until along comes Mayor Lori Lightfoot.\"Downtown, West Side and west suburban U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-7th), who just survived a close primary battle for renomination, also endorsed Lightfoot at the event.Lightfoot said she was overcome with emotion to stand with \"three of the most iconic Black leaders of our country.\"\"We have worked very hard together on a range of issues. I depend a lot on our federal partner, and I can't think of three better federal partners than the congresspeople who are standing with me here today,\" the mayor said.\"The future of our city has never been brighter than it is right now,\" she said. \"Yes, we have our challenges. Yes, of course, there's more work to do. But heart and collaboration are the things that I cherish most and that I have received in abundance from these great, great public servants.\"So far there are seven candidates on the 2023 mayoral ballot, including Lightfoot. Also running are aldermen Ray Lopez (15th) and Roderick Sawyer (6th), state Rep. Kam Buckner (D-26), businessman and philanthropist Willie Wilson, activist Ja\u2019Mal Green and former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas.a.gettinger@hpherald.comReporterAaron Gettinger, a third-generation newspaperman, studied sociology at Stanford University and the University of Chicago and joined the Herald in 2018.",
